1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,960
yeah

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,230
that's a lot for showing up sorry I'm I

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,350
have a slight cold so I'm highly doped

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,500
but yeah please bear with me I totally

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,540
want to give this talk and I'm really

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,300
happy that so many of you are coming for

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,989
such a boring topic documentation is

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:29,529
boring right no okay okay

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,750
you're always already one step ahead of

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,420
me so quick survey how many of you are

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,000
involved in open source projects okay

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,070
how many of you are open so involved in

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,620
open source projects that don't have any

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,020
documentation how many of you are trying

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,060
to change that and how many of you have

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,630
actually written documentation before

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,590
well well

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:07,149
didn't expect that okay so this talk is

19
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,310
titled writing open source documentation

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,670
for open source project it's based on

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,909
our experiences at Sousa but we can

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,340
apply the lessons that we have learned

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,280
to as a project as well and I will tell

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,710
you how to do so first something about

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,600
me my name is Krista Beckett as you have

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
already heard I'm the Linux user since

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,470
1999 in 2005 I became a contributor to

28
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,590
various projects such as the Fedora

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,450
project where I've been very active if

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,010
people know me they probably know me

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,369
from fedora also I've been involved with

32
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,460
xfce in the LXDE and the One Laptop Per

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,270
child initiative in 2010 I was hired by

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,610
coop systems the nice guys downstairs

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,689
with the co-op Cooper server and yeah

36
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,280
early last year I joined Sousa as a

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,919
technical documentation writer and as

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,720
you can see here I'm not sure if you can

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,959
read it this is the invoice from the

40
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,540
first ever Linux distribution I bought

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,080
soozee Linux 6.1 student version 479

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,690
darks in 1999 one of the reasons why I

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,060
purchased Sousa Wars well everybody was

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,800
using it at the time if people were

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,320
using Linux they were using or in

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,060
Germany in particular they were using

47
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,750
Sousa and one of the reasons for that is

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,850
it was a German distribution and it was

49
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,980
always very strong when it comes to

50
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,770
documentation so documentation this big

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,120
handbook was a great benefit I still use

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520
this even when I no longer used to

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,780
openSUSE I've been using other

54
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,250
distributions I've been using debian

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,370
fedora whatnot but still documentation

56
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,420
was the key so that's me

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,570
who are we that's the openSUSE

58
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,490
documentation team at the writer doc

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,290
Doc's conference in Prague in fall last

60
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,900
year I think there you can see me down

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,630
there yeah in the back you can see our

62
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,250
team eat markers fine are probably some

63
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,340
of him norman from linux magazine and

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,230
yeah that's not even all of us there's

65
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,420
more because we have been growing

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,110
rapidly

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,970
suza has been growing the documentation

68
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,040
team has been growing and also the

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,050
numbers of the number of products that

70
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,810
we are to document is also steadily

71
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,660
increasing so who are we so the next

72
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,600
question obviously is what do we want

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,860
and we want to document all the things

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,930
so much for the laughter that's that's

75
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,500
the only picture I suck at slides so the

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,850
rest of this presentation will be boring

77
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,670
yeah what are you what do you mean with

78
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,120
document all the things he's yeah you

79
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,739
probably cannot read it I can't read it

80
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,780
either it's too small here you have an

81
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,760
overview of the Sousa documentation

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,160
website as you can see it's quite a lot

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,370
if you go that's only by products if you

84
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,279
go further down into one of the products

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,220
you see different kinds of guides like

86
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,050
get it started or quick install guides

87
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,360
deployment guides user guides

88
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,060
administrator guides then certain topic

89
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,289
oriented guy

90
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,809
like tuning guides virtualization guides

91
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,999
and of course with every new release we

92
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:42,550
have release notes all of that sums up

93
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,189
to I think at the moment it's 14,000

94
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:51,099
pages if I'm not mistaken with Susan

95
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,409
Linux into our enterprise 12 so that's

96
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,740
quite a lot of documentation and the

97
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,860
question becomes how do we handle that

98
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,659
how do we write it and how do we handle

99
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:04,539
it so we are talking about the tool

100
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,379
chain Sousa has basically written a tool

101
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,869
chain of its own because we figured at

102
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,449
the time we started I mean that predates

103
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,959
me joining Sousa but at the time they

104
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,680
started they couldn't find any decent

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,249
tools if you go to if some of you are in

106
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:26,860
documentation and they go to special

107
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,599
documentation conference it's not like

108
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,279
right the docs which is focusing on free

109
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,869
software but to like take on the German

110
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:36,069
document foundation for technical

111
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,709
documentation you will see all of that

112
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,499
is proprietary and of course Sousa

113
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:44,680
didn't want to go that way so we did

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,099
everything on our own and we wrote a

115
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:52,740
fully compliant open-source tool chain

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,469
we start off with docbook xml for us

117
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,779
it's the language of our choice I know

118
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,729
there are others I know that that

119
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,119
actually we are like the dinosaur

120
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,309
everybody has moved on to something more

121
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:14,879
modern like like just markup or yeah

122
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,019
there's there's plenty of stuff but I'd

123
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,969
write the docs I figured that we are one

124
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,550
of the few to use doc book but on the

125
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,080
other hand I very much like the

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,240
semantics well there's there's a lot of

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,589
advantages too much to explain it now I

128
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,869
could go on but we really figured it was

129
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,119
the only language that catered all our

130
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,580
use cases whatever other language came

131
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,649
up there was always some feature missing

132
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,310
it's docbook as its xml it's as people

133
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,160
say right only language you can write it

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,060
but you cannot read it right the the

135
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,220
upside is many people are familiar with

136
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,820
HTML or xml in general and many of them

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,590
can you can learn it pretty quickly if

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,110
you just do a short if you want to

139
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,610
submit a short patch or something like

140
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,360
that you can gee if you see para parar

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,520
okay that's probably means paragraph i

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,990
should put my text into inside a

143
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,820
paragraph and you're done so that's

144
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,260
pretty pretty trivial and you can see

145
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,810
all about doc doc doc dr. dark next when

146
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,040
you have the language you need an editor

147
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,710
you know probably know this from

148
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,660
classical programmer paintings on tumblr

149
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,140
that is the everlasting battle of MX

150
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:47,190
versus vim so yes you can use any editor

151
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,190
you want I'm favoring them most of the

152
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,840
others in the team are using Emacs their

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,470
proprietary editors there are you can

154
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,750
use G edit J edit whatever atomic no it

155
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,250
Adam yeah Adam so many of them once

156
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,590
you've created your quote in or your doc

157
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,550
book files in the editor you need to

158
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,610
somehow publish it and this is where our

159
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,970
tool chain kicks in we wrote a tool that

160
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,310
is called DAPs the dock boat dock book

161
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,600
authoring and publishing suit this is on

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,330
github it's open source you can use it

163
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,000
so some people say well what is that

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,729
it's basically a wrapper around make and

165
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,250
I hear some of you complaining oh are

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,349
you really talking about new make I hate

167
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,510
new make they're actually new makers the

168
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,730
I mean it's the dependency-based build

169
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,320
tool and that's exactly what you need if

170
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,839
you want to generate output files when

171
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,420
people say they don't like make it turns

172
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,270
out they most of the time is they are

173
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,070
using they're talking about how to make

174
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,899
so they are in fact referring to the

175
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,459
outer tools which I don't like either

176
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,010
but anyway can you make is the tool of

177
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,420
our choice it's running in the

178
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,480
background and you have one front end

179
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,970
which you can use to do all kinds of

180
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,459
commands the simplest thing is depths

181
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,500
validate you want to know if your output

182
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,230
is valid if you want to generate a PDF

183
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,050
file you just type the app's PDF you can

184
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,089
see that make is running in the back

185
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,399
because the that's actually like the

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,209
targets for mayic PDF HTML then you can

187
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,990
also pass options like grayscale PDF or

188
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,500
HTML single otherwise you get a chunk of

189
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,010
files we have lots of formats you can

190
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,620
generate man pages plain text files

191
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,010
plain text files are not that easy we

192
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,820
are using we we 3m the browser when it

193
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,700
comes to tables you want to have a clear

194
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,130
output so that's why we first render it

195
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,990
into HTML then use the browser to

196
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,440
display it and save it to a text file

197
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,860
you can do EEP up with Calibra and from

198
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,959
that you can also generate mobi files

199
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,110
for your Kindle and you can generate the

200
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,779
web help that's a special format of HTML

201
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,680
it comes with a with a table of contents

202
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,630
at the side and with a search bar that

203
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,170
is using some sava script so if you are

204
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,000
using for some standalone for your

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,490
product and your you only want this one

206
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,920
single help piece on the internet you

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,430
probably go for web help but you cannot

208
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,529
only generate output formats you can

209
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,110
also do lots of interesting stuff with

210
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,750
it ok here I need to explain something

211
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,100
there's a call the - D parameter refers

212
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,620
to the configuration file every document

213
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,510
has a configuration file where you

214
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,420
specify the document route the starting

215
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,870
point

216
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,670
every XML element has an XML ID so you

217
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,610
start a say from here on I started so

218
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,740
you give it the configuration file and

219
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,480
then you can say

220
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,220
list files I'm looking for the in I have

221
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,800
a ton of files in my repository and I'm

222
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,690
looking for the file that contains the

223
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,980
route ID art for articled apps quick and

224
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,660
I can get that without I mean I could

225
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,000
get vectors with grep probably but that

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,980
would also list a lot of false positives

227
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,589
so we have a command for that or you can

228
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,589
give say generate me a list of all

229
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,500
images with the modification date and

230
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,740
also show these images in a viewer so

231
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,070
it's bright quite a comprehensive tool

232
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,959
then we have some Sousa specific

233
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,670
commands that's not proper

234
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,300
so the translation we do we are it's

235
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,160
written in English even though most of

236
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,440
our team is German which sometimes you

237
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,490
can really see it was written by Germans

238
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,000
because Germans have a special way of

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,470
writing or speaking English especially

240
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,839
when it comes to the to the words like

241
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,930
have to mass need their use differently

242
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,079
in German and yeah so we write in

243
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,089
English and it's then generally

244
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,399
translated by translation agency by an

245
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,529
external a translation agency that's

246
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,579
focused on technical documentation in

247
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,440
order to have them translate our

248
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,290
software we give them basically a big

249
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,560
table all in a clearly defined format

250
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,600
with all the images and so on so that's

251
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,720
generated with lock drop and after the

252
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,180
translated documents come back we can do

253
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,480
unpack lock drop or we can just do the

254
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,930
online Target dubs online to generate

255
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,449
online doc to generate the online

256
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,760
documentation that you see on the pseudo

257
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,420
website so that's actually a quite

258
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,449
powerful tool we are still improving it

259
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,760
and we are meanwhile not the only ones

260
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,149
that are using it while back we received

261
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,240
our first patch by somebody from solando

262
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,250
you probably know them so they are

263
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,329
obviously using a two

264
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,449
next in the tool chain we have the style

265
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,790
sheets you have the XML and you need a

266
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,709
style sheet to generate different output

267
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,619
formats for example we have standalone

268
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,049
books or bigger like the manuals to the

269
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,389
guides we have single articles which are

270
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,239
just a few pages we have just just the

271
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:37,149
HTML and we have different I mean it's

272
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,100
the difference if you will have a PDF or

273
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,049
if you have a website for example on the

274
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:45,399
in the PDF file you want URLs in links

275
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,100
to be written out because on paper you

276
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,709
cannot click I mean you need to have

277
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,109
them written out so this is stand with

278
00:13:53,109 --> 00:14:01,269
the XSLT stylesheets yeah the next we

279
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,850
have a style guide that reminds us how

280
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,759
to phrase it's not only about phrasing

281
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,639
it's well how to spell certain terms

282
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,910
recurring terms what tone to use how do

283
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,829
you address the reader what's the target

284
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:19,929
audience and all of that so you want to

285
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:22,179
have a consistent voice throughout all

286
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,519
your document we want to have consistent

287
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,359
namings

288
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,239
consistent use of terms and all that's

289
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,850
and also the structure and markup needs

290
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,269
to be consistently all that's in our

291
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,999
style guide we then have the style

292
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:42,129
checker which is a tool that you can

293
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:49,329
manually run on the on an XML file it

294
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,089
will output a HTML file which you can

295
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,239
then view in the browser and if you view

296
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,199
it in the browser

297
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,309
you get this nice these are actually

298
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,589
little plus signs where you can just

299
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:06,429
fold the the paragraphs and then you get

300
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:11,799
a list of well notes and warnings of

301
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,179
things you should probably fix

302
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,649
so much for this style checker we have

303
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,450
yet more tools all of them are on github

304
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,380
in the openSUSE organization that's and

305
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,839
is something that we just finished

306
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,000
recently or it's well it's not finished

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,480
but we brought it into production this

308
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,430
week it's continuous integration with

309
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,350
docker

310
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,940
we have dbx included for well in any of

311
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,130
you know stock book you can have

312
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,959
includes but you have the problem that

313
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,779
if you have XML IDs they need to be

314
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,360
unique and if you use and include

315
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,850
various time and doctor documentary the

316
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,519
IDS are no longer unique that's

317
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,230
something that we solved with dbx

318
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,380
included we have the dock manager that

319
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,399
manages meet our tags for example is

320
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,769
this document going to be translated or

321
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,790
not that's something or what path is

322
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,079
once it's published on the website

323
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,350
what's the URL these are custom tags

324
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,060
that we added and they are managed

325
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,459
through the dock manager we have a doc

326
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:30,630
stats tool Kiko doc is our doc books

327
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,880
subset we don't use the full set of doc

328
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,130
book because it's just way too big we

329
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,520
want to actually limit the documentation

330
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,529
writer to a certain subset of elements

331
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,380
that they can use and also that that

332
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,060
allows you to enforce guidelines like

333
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,410
you must not use nested lists with X

334
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,020
level of nesting or you must not use

335
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,910
this element inside the other element

336
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,640
and all that's in the Kiko doc of course

337
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,870
you need an editor that can read the

338
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,880
schema files and that I mean that not

339
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,179
only just syntax like syntax

340
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,939
highlighting or autocomplete but that

341
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,800
also like the the structure of the

342
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,609
semantics is interesting and also xml

343
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,329
diff ng next angie is next generation

344
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,599
there was already in xml diff out there

345
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,730
if you compare xml files

346
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,590
the classical way as you do with get for

347
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,250
example I mean even though we try to

348
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,760
have very strict with with the

349
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,180
dimensioned ups out all format that

350
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,010
earlier so we have common formatting

351
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,890
like like indentions and and no white

352
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,720
spaces at the end of the line and all

353
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,210
that even though sometimes patches look

354
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,960
messy and that's why you can use docked

355
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,770
up the XML DIF ng to really compare the

356
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,450
content of the file it's not the XML

357
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,560
syntax okay so much for the tool chain

358
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,800
you can ask questions later now I'm

359
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,110
going to talk about the process as I say

360
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,930
it's all open

361
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,140
everything is on github here you see the

362
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,200
docs lis repository so that's the it's

363
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,370
no longer the open through the

364
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,680
organization it's the souza organization

365
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,430
on github you have Doc's Lee and other

366
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,110
repositories all prefixed with Doc

367
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,200
that's us Lee is su the Linux Enterprise

368
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,710
Server and related products here you can

369
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,820
see the DC files for the admin guide or

370
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,230
for the everything guide and so on yeah

371
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,300
it's on github you can submit pull

372
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,090
requests you can you can take it as you

373
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,730
need it and from the slave documentation

374
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,770
we also built the openSUSE documentation

375
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,720
it's basically the same thing except

376
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,630
that phrases like SUSE Linux Enterprise

377
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,040
are replaced with oh the time is

378
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,220
actually getting longer oh I was

379
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,950
hurrying up and and so now I have 30

380
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,440
minutes left okay I slowed down a bit

381
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,910
Thanks yeah it's on github you can use

382
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,860
it you can fork it you can do whatever

383
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,560
you want with it you can even some

384
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,520
people even we were surprised a while

385
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,790
ago when we saw our documentation on

386
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,720
Amazon somebody is obviously generating

387
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
books from it printing it and selling it

388
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,690
we have no idea who it is we have

389
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,610
nothing to do with it but it's our

390
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,110
documentation it's

391
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,049
it's really ours we verified it so you

392
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,870
can do that it's open it's all GFDL

393
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:54,020
licensed use it as you like so when we

394
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,210
are talking about git I need to explain

395
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,740
the branching model a bit maybe some of

396
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,510
you have read this article the

397
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,520
successful get branching model by

398
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:12,950
Vincent Driessen well the schema it's

399
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,990
not the diagram it's not necessarily the

400
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,410
most it looks a bit messy but it's be

401
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,840
compared it's because it's so small so

402
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,419
basically we are using the developed

403
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,260
branch for development the master branch

404
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,990
is the blue one over here it's only used

405
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,720
for releases there you have the text for

406
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
every release and then we have different

407
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,179
branches for features bug fixes and

408
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,530
maintenance and there also they all

409
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,350
follow a consistent naming like feature

410
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,510
slash fade one two three four fate is

411
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,490
the feature and enhancement tracker that

412
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,919
Sousa is using it's also open source you

413
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,200
can find it as open fate it's also used

414
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,049
in openSUSE for suggesting new features

415
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,390
and discussing feature implementation or

416
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,549
bug fix BSC is back till Azusa comm and

417
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,799
then the back number so we are trying to

418
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,220
have a very consistent branch naming

419
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,160
people work on their own branches and

420
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,600
when they are done with it they submit

421
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,750
merge request through github and we are

422
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,820
using which recently started using the

423
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,540
new review feature from github maybe I

424
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,429
can show it later if people don't know

425
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,890
it yet that's actually something very

426
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,380
nice yeah and we are using this tool

427
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,940
called git flow well oh there's a typo

428
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,580
it's it's not F but it's V get flow AVH

429
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,100
that's a fork from the original git flow

430
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,179
too so git flow is an extension

431
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,799
if you have a good repository you type

432
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,490
get flow in it in it once add some

433
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,409
values to the configuration file that

434
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,049
you can for example the naming of these

435
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,809
branches the prefix feature back fix

436
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,870
maintenance yeah it's a helper to

437
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,759
implement this branching model and you

438
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,639
can modify the configuration as you like

439
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,159
but it makes sure that you have

440
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,519
consistent naming when you want to open

441
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,820
a new feature so you start working on

442
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,789
something you type good flow feature BSC

443
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,659
one two three four

444
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,210
start when you're done you would use git

445
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,460
flow feature finish but we no longer

446
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,840
uses this but use github reviews merges

447
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,539
instead yeah and github things get

448
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,419
reviewed thing and then we we try to

449
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,330
squash squash all the commits into one

450
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,879
so that and they have a meaningful

451
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,500
commit message that you can later

452
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,740
cherry-pick the whole feature of the

453
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,019
whole bug fix without having to

454
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,330
cherry-pick twenty individual fixes but

455
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,580
one one commit only yeah so much for the

456
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,279
branching mode of model now the bigger

457
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,940
picture so we have three main sources

458
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,990
for input either through fate which I

459
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,490
already mentioned through Bugzilla

460
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,669
partners or employees file box because

461
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:33,169
they found found it back in the

462
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:35,509
documentation or through a system that

463
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,460
is called doc comments I'll get to that

464
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,090
later after that we do evaluation and

465
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,600
planning to be honest that's why I don't

466
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,639
write it out there we are using Trello

467
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:50,870
for the organization a lot of you are

468
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,240
probably using it personally I don't

469
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,129
like it I don't like it because it's not

470
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:58,340
open source obviously we are or I'm

471
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,769
trying to push people to use fabricator

472
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:04,190
instead or something else but yeah

473
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,929
there's plenty of tools I mean you can

474
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:08,029
use when it comes to tracking there's

475
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,809
there's

476
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,480
many open-source tools out there but

477
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,110
nowadays I mean I'm old-school I use

478
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,269
Bugzilla or something like that or it in

479
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,330
fedora we use spatula a lot but nowadays

480
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,669
people want to have these work BOTS and

481
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,409
I want to have nice drag-and-drop in the

482
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,169
browser and whatnot so we use Trello

483
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,309
that's important when it comes to

484
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,919
planning we assign resources we have we

485
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,720
have this team of like 13 and we have

486
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,399
these tasks to do and we have an

487
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,029
estimation of how much every task is so

488
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,129
you pick your Trello cards this is what

489
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,519
I'm working on yeah that's really so the

490
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,960
resource planning is actually something

491
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,999
I forgot here we have Gantt charts as

492
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,249
well but I don't do them and I don't

493
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,740
know what the software is called for

494
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,470
doing it yeah after the planning comes

495
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,759
the research usually when there's

496
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,409
something new you need to research at

497
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,419
first you cannot just start documenting

498
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,379
it's right right I mean if I knew

499
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:20,179
everything I wouldn't be yeah I well

500
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:21,769
there's nobody who knows everything

501
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,600
actually we do have some documentation

502
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,580
writers who know more about certain

503
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,429
things they're focused on storage for

504
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:29,899
example and they know they have so much

505
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:31,970
they have accumulated so much knowledge

506
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,600
over the time but usually when there's

507
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,730
something new you first sit down with

508
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,830
the developer for like two hours and he

509
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,070
explains this new feature yeah then

510
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,019
comes the documentation this is where

511
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,230
all the the unicorns are born and and

512
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,029
everything yeah it's it's sometimes it's

513
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,340
hard work but it's just writing the easy

514
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,320
stuff and I think I've explained the

515
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,049
tool chain already so let's just say

516
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:00,970
it's magic

517
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,919
after that we send it to the developers

518
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,279
for feedback it's not yet published some

519
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,409
of the documents are then translated and

520
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,570
then they are published on the website

521
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,350
later

522
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:22,039
so one thing but that's actually we are

523
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,289
not done once it's published I mean it's

524
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,870
it's a constant iteration not only with

525
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,480
every new Sousa release but with every

526
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,850
release of the documentation sometimes

527
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,860
we do publish doc updates after the

528
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,860
release and also with every feedback we

529
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,240
get and the feedback is something that

530
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,059
many people forget when they write

531
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:46,820
documentation so we have two main

532
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,950
methods for feedback one is you can

533
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,190
report a box so as you can see these are

534
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,630
two screenshots from the Sousa

535
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,039
documentation from the online

536
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,380
documentation and there's actually a

537
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,710
report back at the bottom at the top for

538
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,809
every paragraph which automatically

539
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:06,130
opens bugzilla it fills in all the forms

540
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,200
which book is at which chapter which

541
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
everything and then people just need to

542
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,990
fill out their feedback or their

543
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,399
criticism or whatever they have in the

544
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:19,309
comment field of bugzilla the other

545
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,380
system I quickly briefly mentioned it

546
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,340
earlier it's called doc comments this is

547
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,090
the system that you see here once again

548
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,130
in the background we have the XSLT

549
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,220
stylesheets working the XSLT stylesheets

550
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,210
again doc book they allow you to for

551
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,220
example only we have the we have a

552
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,279
nightly version of the documentation

553
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:49,309
that's generated every night if you

554
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,820
click the back the feedback back

555
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,760
feedback button there you're directed to

556
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
bugzilla but on the documentation that

557
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,799
is that goes live you're directed to the

558
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,830
doc comment system which is yeah more

559
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,510
intuitive you just need to fill out your

560
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,120
email and your name and can provide

561
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,279
feedback so for technical people of

562
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,720
Zilla is probably the way to submit

563
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,600
feedback for less tech-savvy people it's

564
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,750
probably documents or other people just

565
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,380
send us emails - doc - team at Sousa

566
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,419
calm so that works as well but really

567
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,150
don't forget the feedback

568
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,970
and don't rely on people I mean make it

569
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:34,120
easy for people to give feedback don't

570
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,940
rely on if the hurdle is so hard

571
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,040
hi that you require them to submit pull

572
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,430
requests on github you probably won't

573
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,770
get a lot of feedback so there needs to

574
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,550
be a low entry barrier for feedback and

575
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,280
the more feedback you have the easier it

576
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,810
is the more feedback you get the more

577
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,890
feedback you get the better your

578
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,490
documentation gets and in the end

579
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,010
ideally all questions are answered and

580
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,280
yeah no more feedback needed which never

581
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,970
happens but all right but so far that

582
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,410
works out pretty well and I think

583
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,830
compared to other documentation teams we

584
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,080
are doing pretty fine we've seen that at

585
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,770
the right calm the conference last year

586
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,660
where people were telling us what they

587
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,060
are planning to do and we figured like

588
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,950
oh we are already doing that we are

589
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,130
already doing this so but of course we

590
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,840
do have some problems as well

591
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,850
well continuous integration that problem

592
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,230
was just solved last week but the

593
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,420
biggest problem that I see is we are

594
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,250
still doing the traditional waterfall

595
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:51,750
thing we have tried to become more agile

596
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,500
or more continuous but that doesn't

597
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,110
necessarily work there's always a very

598
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,930
short timeframe between when a feature

599
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,180
becomes ready for testing and for

600
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,390
documenting and between the release so

601
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,850
after the the beta from beta to release

602
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,120
of Susan or opens to the product we are

603
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,450
very very very busy and don't have time

604
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,410
for anything else

605
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,740
[Music]

606
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,790
sometimes we even have to wait all

607
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,510
features we can do that if the doc if

608
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,950
there's no documentation and the feature

609
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,710
is useless it probably gets delayed or

610
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,840
we need to provide a documentation

611
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,990
update later so again the workload

612
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,220
throughout the year is not constant

613
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,919
and yeah that's definitely something

614
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,409
that we need to address are weird but

615
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:47,149
it's always a question of I mean of

616
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:49,820
course you can do the whole agile thing

617
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,360
and document every single feature and

618
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,129
every line of code that the developer

619
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,769
does but then I'll get to that just a

620
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,409
moment but then yeah while you're in

621
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,559
this in this never-ending loop you

622
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,320
document something if you have a scrum

623
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,679
cycle a sprint and after two weeks you

624
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,929
figure out oh our developers went into

625
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:14,509
the wrong direction and let's do it from

626
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,610
scratch you have documented something

627
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,289
well that isn't there or you have

628
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,070
documented it for yeah no it doesn't

629
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,480
work out so you start all over again

630
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,769
for example screenshots our typical

631
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,320
example right before the release we have

632
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,299
to go through all these screenshots in

633
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,190
the in the documentation again

634
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,009
to make sure they are up to date even if

635
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,190
only a tiny thing in the in the

636
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,230
interface has changed you definitely

637
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,700
want the latest screenshot or the

638
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,139
checkbox or developers keep renaming

639
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,149
options or something like that and you

640
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,399
are referring to this option not only in

641
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,740
the screenshot but in the text so this

642
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,710
can become very cumbersome and if you do

643
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,720
this last minute yeah also we are

644
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,809
decoupled from development that's both

645
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,629
the back or can we just address your

646
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,649
question later after the

647
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,770
okay I already addressed it thank you we

648
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,779
are decoupled from development that

649
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,620
spoke both a feature and back well

650
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,529
people think the developer is the best

651
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,529
person to write documentation but he

652
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,149
actually isn't I mean he knows the inner

653
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,360
workings of his application but he

654
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,460
doesn't know the users expectations for

655
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,460
him everything is so obvious why would

656
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,200
people even ask questions right so you

657
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,289
always need or in a perfect world if

658
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:47,940
your organization is big enough you do

659
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,950
have a dedicated documentation team or

660
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,899
in your community you have some

661
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,710
volunteers who do the documentation and

662
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,600
ideally they are not the same ones that

663
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,950
are also working on the code we inside

664
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,960
Sousa can bridge this gap by sitting

665
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,000
down with the developers but on the

666
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,950
other hand sometimes it's I mean sitting

667
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,649
down is always very nice but sometimes

668
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:14,309
it's also emails back and forth back and

669
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,159
forth 20 times that is cumbersome as

670
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,130
well so the coordination effort is very

671
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,390
big and the last problem that I see is

672
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,799
so the first two problems can probably

673
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,960
be addressed with a more continuous and

674
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,960
agile approach we do have for example

675
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,350
the cloud guys in the in Sousa are

676
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,350
working with the agile approach they

677
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,020
have a dedicated documentation writer in

678
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,880
their team who works with the developers

679
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,549
every day who follows their Sprint's so

680
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,309
we will probably switch to to a model

681
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:51,630
like that but on the other hand you

682
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,480
still need we have this big big big

683
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
monolithic as I call it documentation

684
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,159
like the reference guide or something

685
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,649
that's not something that you write on

686
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:04,049
the drive by while you're developing

687
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:06,210
that's a huge effort and that's where

688
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,010
you need the team of documentation

689
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,349
writer so we will try something in the

690
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,710
in in between between an agile and a

691
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,480
waterfall approach let's see where we

692
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,629
end up with this and to address this

693
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,599
monolithic issue the issue of what this

694
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,480
big monolithic thing we would probably

695
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,489
switch to

696
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:29,250
more topic oriented documentation topic

697
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,290
oriented is the new buzzword when it

698
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,300
comes to documentation that's like you

699
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,159
have a single task you have a user story

700
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,560
you want to go from A to B want to

701
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,409
achieve this or that yeah that should be

702
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,480
that should lower or should solve some

703
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,070
of the problems but on the other hand in

704
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,830
traditional documentation the admin

705
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,449
guide or the reference guide is not

706
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:54,000
going away anytime soon because people

707
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,639
customers want it they want to have one

708
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,500
point of contact where they have like

709
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,720
all the options of this program or so D

710
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,390
so the new topic oriented formats we are

711
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,400
using are more like in addition we

712
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
recently started a series called Susan

713
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,350
best practices which will do ya the best

714
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,360
practices for virtualization the best

715
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,090
practices for this or that purpose so

716
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,790
that's more topic oriented now let's go

717
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,880
to the lessons we've learned

718
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,780
docks or it didn't happen I mean you all

719
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,670
know picsArt didn't happen for us that

720
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,470
docks are didn't have him if there's no

721
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,410
documentation for you for your app for I

722
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,420
mean even if it's just a tiny app I had

723
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,330
an app on my mobile I had a problem with

724
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,160
it it turned out to be a back there was

725
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,090
a button missing on a certain screen but

726
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,160
how was I supposed to know there was no

727
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,960
documentation there was a reference his

728
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,910
design should there be a button or not

729
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,270
so you totally need documentation even

730
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,020
if some Mac guys tell you that programs

731
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,940
should be so intuitive that they don't

732
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,610
require documentation you will need

733
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,820
documentation period and don't consider

734
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,250
your work done until unless you're done

735
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,620
with the documentation if feature is not

736
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,450
implemented if there's no documentation

737
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,360
for it really that's that's things that

738
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,190
that also product managers need to

739
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,900
understand of course they want

740
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,160
everything and they want everything now

741
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,560
or they want everything last week but if

742
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,300
there's no QA and if there's no

743
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,670
documentation then it's not done period

744
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,440
yeah as I already mentioned developers

745
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,230
short not write docs we are doing it for

746
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,100
a good reason don't write about the

747
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,120
stuff you know by heart

748
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,930
done

749
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,579
you know somebody's taking taking photos

750
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,730
of these slides yeah you need feedback

751
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,890
channels without feedback it's all

752
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,660
useless you're running in circles you

753
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,790
have no idea what the users expectations

754
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,930
are actually are you can do the you can

755
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,559
do the long reference guide maybe it

756
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,720
doesn't help maybe you use us and expect

757
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,220
something completely different so if you

758
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,910
don't have feedback channels yeah then

759
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,329
it's it's not really worth the effort so

760
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,710
think about the feedback before you

761
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,270
start writing and try to make the

762
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,250
feedback as easy as possible yeah you

763
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,589
need tools

764
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:38,510
don't try to spend too much time on

765
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,550
tooling I mean we didn't write all these

766
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,530
tools because we felt oh we need to

767
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,140
write yet another tool when we started

768
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,030
out there they were just not there

769
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,220
meanwhile there there are other tools

770
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,119
for example fedora has at least has had

771
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,000
a public publican which is something

772
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,299
similar to Dobbs but it's meanwhile

773
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,720
orphaned I think it's no no longer used

774
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,089
Fedora recently switched away from doc

775
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:08,660
book the - for example pan doc that's

776
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,880
something similar to what what we do

777
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,579
with dubs that can strands light between

778
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:15,530
different documentation format and

779
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,069
output PDF or HTML and so on so there

780
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:21,530
are already plenty of tools out there if

781
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,660
you have any question about a tool or so

782
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,750
you can ask me but make sure you have

783
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,390
the right tools for the job to get the

784
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,390
job done yeah don't spend too much time

785
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,510
on tooling but on the other hand don't

786
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,049
try to no don't you have to spend some

787
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,369
time on the tooling other right

788
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,920
otherwise the writing becomes too

789
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,690
cumbersome but on the other hand don't

790
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,210
reinvent the wheel by by writing yet

791
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,180
another oh this is solving our all our

792
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,460
documentation problems there are some

793
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,910
proprietary solutions out there which

794
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:00,819
really awesome but totally useless

795
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,510
well for our use case for your skates

796
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,210
useless detail or something like this I

797
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,650
mean there's company making big money

798
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,170
with it but it doesn't cater our use

799
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,750
case and when we then I mean we had

800
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,120
sales agents who were trying to convince

801
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,010
us and we tell them we've written our

802
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,110
own and we publish it for free they were

803
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,270
like what okay

804
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,220
that's small don't start with a

805
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,140
reference guide I mean that's basically

806
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,080
at the very top of the of the

807
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,300
documentation you start small start with

808
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,840
a certain use case try I mean at the

809
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,460
very beginning you probably don't have a

810
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,460
community of documentation writers or

811
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,630
your company doesn't have anyone

812
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,800
employed for writing documentation so at

813
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,360
the beginning at least at the beginning

814
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,700
it will probably be the developer try to

815
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,410
see something from the users perspective

816
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,320
and try to try to think of the typical

817
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,370
user tasks but a user that the user is

818
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,200
trying to achieve and and this

819
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,870
particular topic write it down like how

820
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,030
do I connect to the mail server or

821
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,330
something like that but don't do the I'm

822
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,020
covering all menu options of my program

823
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,480
and then our command line options or

824
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,100
something like that that's at the very

825
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,250
very end of the documentation if you're

826
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,600
done with everything else you can do

827
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,540
this and last but not least

828
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,550
documentation should be open if you're

829
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,580
doing open source your documentation

830
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,370
should be open and by open I not only

831
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,700
mean have your sources somewhere on

832
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,370
github I mean we we do have our sources

833
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,350
on github you can do that whatever you

834
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,620
want as I told you before but also try

835
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,350
to have an open process that allows the

836
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,860
community and allows other people to

837
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,170
give feedback to participate yeah

838
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,320
personally we found it it's difficult to

839
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,870
encourage the community to to start

840
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,300
working on documentation documentation

841
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,490
is something that many people take for

842
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,700
granted and you only use it when you

843
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,320
have a problem as long as everything is

844
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,900
fine you don't need it so that's why

845
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,850
probably not a lot of people want to

846
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,520
work on it but

847
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,170
within the community you can do

848
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,730
something I mean start with something

849
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,600
small like a wiki yeah be open and

850
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,540
that's the message I wanted to bring to

851
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,450
all of you if there are any questions we

852
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,070
have like eight minutes left or

853
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:42,760
something okay first question so the

854
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,320
question was how do we manage the

855
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,660
localization of our documentation

856
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,340
I mentioned the dock manager earlier the

857
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,860
dock manager has so at the head of the

858
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,610
document you have some some Meetup texts

859
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,610
some some additional dock book elements

860
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,400
the custom elements and they define

861
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,260
whether or not this documentation is

862
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,660
translated so for example the install

863
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,900
guide is translated into these 20

864
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,050
languages the quick install while the

865
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,940
reference guide is only available in

866
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,440
English or the tuning guard or the

867
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,320
virtualization guide so I think we have

868
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,460
like around 20 20 different languages

869
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,710
it's like what we have like some stuff

870
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,450
is not translated at all others is

871
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,860
translated into six languages and and if

872
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,050
when you do the full languages that's

873
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,360
around 20 and that's all defined by

874
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,980
these meta text within the dock manager

875
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,200
we then give it to the translation

876
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,980
agency and from there they they go on to

877
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,470
to do the actual translations

878
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:05,749
the transition to be honest so the

879
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,970
question was how do they do the actual

880
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,009
management to be honest I don't know

881
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:11,839
because I don't do the translation

882
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,279
myself that's something that we have out

883
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,789
sourced you can do this for example this

884
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:18,980
is what we did at caught up at the coop

885
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,079
coop where server with tools like

886
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,039
transifex this online translation tool

887
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,299
this is also good because it gives

888
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:28,069
people small chunks

889
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:30,559
I mean it's broken down to strings or

890
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,809
paragraphs and people can start working

891
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:33,380
on it

892
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,230
so that's something that I would suggest

893
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,349
but yeah I can imagine that if you say I

894
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,240
have this file in English and I now I'm

895
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,150
doing it in German or something that is

896
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,249
difficult but sorry I cannot really give

897
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:50,599
you the answer I don't know what they're

898
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,309
the translators workflow is I don't

899
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:53,930
think they start from scratch that but

900
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,119
they will probably really take our files

901
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,259
and overwrite the text but that's just a

902
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:01,999
wild guess and if you're looking for

903
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,680
something for a community I would

904
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,598
recommend tools like transifex

905
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:26,269
to try and so the quit the question was

906
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:28,609
if I make it short why we are using

907
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:31,160
github if it's if it's closed source

908
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,680
well on github you have a large user

909
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,499
base personally I would like to use get

910
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:38,569
lab or something well that's not

911
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:39,829
actually the question the question is

912
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:41,839
what do you think of the state of tools

913
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,970
for documentation on services like

914
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,980
github and get map and would you be

915
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,809
willing to share some of your

916
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:52,999
I don't think that integration of

917
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:55,710
documented I mean they're focusing on

918
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,799
code not on documentation for example

919
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,989
they can if you're using mark-up that

920
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,869
works markup can be displayed directly

921
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:08,069
in line in github of course it's well

922
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,339
the output depends on the browser or so

923
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,529
but you get an idea if you look at an

924
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:16,349
XML file and github it's just XML I

925
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:19,319
would laughs github to have an XML

926
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,720
preview but that's obviously not not

927
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,299
trivial because then it needs to know

928
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:27,029
the style sheets and whatnot so yeah but

929
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:30,359
really they don't care about the

930
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,549
documentation much they care about code

931
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:35,700
but the answer to this is treat

932
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,420
documentation like your treat code apply

933
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,369
continuous integration apply release

934
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:43,470
engineering tactics that you would use

935
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,799
for code as well but certainly the tools

936
00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:48,329
could be all the services could be

937
00:45:48,329 --> 00:46:00,930
improved you had a question as well we

938
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,799
cannot so the question was how do we

939
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:06,269
guarantee that the documentation is

940
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:09,390
up-to-date and I'm sorry I hate to admit

941
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,910
it we can't of course we go through it

942
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,890
like when it when it comes to say the

943
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,420
screenshots that's a pretty trivial

944
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,579
thing you go over the documentation and

945
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,559
make sure the screenshots are still up

946
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,829
to date but we don't really rework every

947
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:29,460
guide for every release we implement the

948
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,950
new features we implement changes but of

949
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,700
course there sometimes is outdated

950
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,279
information still in there that's where

951
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,799
we rely on feedback where we rely on

952
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:46,049
users to file box well in a perfect

953
00:46:46,049 --> 00:46:48,150
world you would have quality assurance

954
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,039
not only for code but also for

955
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:52,200
documentation that somebody really goes

956
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,359
through it and make sure it's still up

957
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,549
to date but that's something that you

958
00:46:56,549 --> 00:47:02,390
cannot really do because of the effort

959
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,110
the second one is a very broad question

960
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:33,280
but okay the second question first

961
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,930
why not have technical writers as QA for

962
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,080
documentation I'm not saying that I'm

963
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,230
against that but it's it's the question

964
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,300
whether or not if you can't afford it

965
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,820
if you have somebody only working on QA

966
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,930
of Docs and also I think that people who

967
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,940
do QA I've been doing QA before they

968
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,670
should be see things just like the

969
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,950
documentation writer needs to see things

970
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,630
from a different perspective as the

971
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,300
developer somebody in QA needs to see it

972
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,610
from a different perspective so actually

973
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,390
maybe it a technical documentation

974
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,750
writer wouldn't be the best for the

975
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,980
person for QA on Docs

976
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,850
I would rather have real-world user

977
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,200
testing of dogs

978
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,440
there's have grabbed people from the

979
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,530
street and and tell them to perform this

980
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,550
or that if you have topic oriented

981
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,750
documentation it should be easy to give

982
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,450
people tasks that they fulfill and then

983
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,520
you see if it really works or not that's

984
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,610
more interesting than QA so I think we

985
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,050
are running out of time for questions

986
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,480
okay final questions for those of you

987
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,490
who don't have a chance I will be around

988
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,530
on the hallway you can grab me there

989
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,370
okay you got the house

990
00:48:54,770 --> 00:49:00,560
reach out stream sure sure we reach out

991
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,540
for ups so the question was if we reach

992
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,990
out for upstream yes we try to but

993
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,830
sometimes it's it I mean if I find

994
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,630
something that we work with upstream but

995
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,250
sometimes getting stuff back into

996
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,780
upstream is very difficult

997
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,100
like I recently had something that I

998
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,040
needed to document which was some weird

999
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,860
behavior of the Linux kernel when it

1000
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,680
comes to epic routing and so the only

1001
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,730
documentation out there was a five five

1002
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,970
lines of text in a plain text file in

1003
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,930
the kernel source tree and some comments

1004
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,650
in the kernel code itself I would love

1005
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,720
to fix that of course then I can say oh

1006
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,530
I feel committed in the Linux kernel but

1007
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,440
as you can imagine the process of

1008
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,720
getting something accepted is quite

1009
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,850
cumbersome and at this point in time I'm

1010
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,880
not doing it but other we usually try to

1011
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,010
upstream everything all of our work and

1012
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,960
souza is actually contributing upstream

1013
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,670
like we are doing the OpenStack

1014
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,440
documentation for upstream open

1015
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,320
OpenStack all right

1016
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,960
I think that's all thanks very much for

1017
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,170
your

1018
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,550
yeah so use our tools breaks them

1019
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,710
provide feedbacks and fetches thanks a

1020
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,860
lot
