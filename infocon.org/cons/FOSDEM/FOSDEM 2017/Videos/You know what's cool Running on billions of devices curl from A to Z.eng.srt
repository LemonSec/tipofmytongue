3
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,710

7
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,729

8
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,659
an email it's actually a year ago now it

9
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,920
started out like this nice and friendly

10
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,840
right it was a woman she had even hit me

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,039
a couple of months ago she had a big

12
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,440
problem she you know she had her account

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,020
hacked on Instagram she told me in one

14
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,299
in my help I had no idea why she would

15
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,459
contact me about that right talk to

16
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,840
Instagram I have no idea what you're

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,950
talking about why are you emailing me

18
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,399
anyway well you know I found your email

19
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,659
address here so you must be sort of

20
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,539
associated somehow right so please talk

21
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,879
to your friends at Instagram and sort it

22
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,879
out for me so I try to sort of explain

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,819
to her that no no no no no they use code

24
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:04,729
I wrote so I had didn't even know that

25
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,149
until you told me so but she didn't

26
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,699
really understand or she didn't really

27
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,220
believe me I think but in the end I

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,140
think I convinced her that no no no

29
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,050
Instagram did their thing I did mine it

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,510
just happened to end up there so

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,250
everything turned quiet for a while and

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,909
then she made me again and she said yeah

33
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,030
well I went to a wire that at my hacking

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,890
code was used by Instagram so well so

35
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,050
she she brought me than some new

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,590
evidence sort of share with me that she

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,000
had found my name also in the Spotify

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,760
terms and condition Exhibit B right team

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,430
look

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,760
my name is a Spotify to Instagram as

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,430
Spotify both on her phone that's sort of

42
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,959
that can't be a coincidence I had been

43
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,299
lying to her the entire time I was

44
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,370
involved from the beginning please fix

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,549
this and you know these are big

46
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,170
companies have you we don't want to mess

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,689
with these guys you don't want to show

48
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,060
that your portable instagram has Spotify

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,829
hacking ring so please and she you

50
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:17,590
coined the phrase please unpacked the

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,609
act and I sort of that not rhymes with

52
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:21,909
me

53
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,829
so I'm trying to unhak hacks all the

54
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,730
time no that's sort of some interesting

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,030
stories from my inbox so um I'd like to

56
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,709
share some other stories from the

57
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,510
hacking ring or perhaps more accurately

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,939
an open-source project that I've been

59
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,439
filling with for a while

60
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,810
it's called curve and we have a colon

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,660
slash slash in the logo curl is an old

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,560
project but just to make sure that we're

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,150
all on the same page here it's an open

64
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,650
source project we make a command-line

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,859
tool and we make a library and we

66
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,519
transfer data specified as URLs usually

67
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,489
usually and it supports protocols

68
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,230
basically you know HTP you have to pay

69
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,539
your bla bla bla so of course we started

70
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,630
a long time ago and a long time ago of

71
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,789
course we had sort of a lot of building

72
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,039
blocks but we didn't have a curve so

73
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,570
like any other project you start at some

74
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,900
point and in my case I one point wanted

75
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,909
to have a little tool to download

76
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,070
current rates from the web I was writing

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,159
an IRC BOTS and in our C channel you of

78
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,120
course won't have some real-time

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,030
currency exchange commands so I needed

80
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,770
to just download Karen's rates like

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,800
daily or so right HTTP sites have curves

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,840
rates I just needed to download them

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,660
so I found a little tool in same year

84
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,560
this movie premiered 1996 so I started

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,620
that actually sort of make it download a

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,040
HTTP couple of hundred lines of code

87
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,740
HTTP 1 to 0 it's really really well it's

88
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,530
probably not a simple protocol but if

89
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,840
you're doing it a bit carelessly and

90
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,740
just fast it's really simple so then

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,169
then sort of yeah that started to work

92
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,030
and then suddenly we found out that wow

93
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,900
they have currency on gopher sites too I

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,750
had no free support and currency rates

95
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,150
on FTP sites so yeah we had enough data

96
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,830
to support you and the the previous that

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,290
moment it had been called HTTP GET and

98
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,600
it was called URL yet and then one day

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,220
we added ftp upload support and suddenly

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,720
the naming was wrong again and we

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,440
released curl 1998 will it supports a

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,210
chappie go for an ftp and ftp upload

103
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,460
yeah 1998 March 20 so and then yeah you

104
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,350
know we're nope a source project we can

105
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,760
bunch of friends we had stuff we like

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,010
and we fixed some bugs and other people

107
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,800
come around and we keep on working on it

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,700
and the number of lines of code sort of

109
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:22,180
grew over the years I think it's rather

110
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,530
suspicious that we can actually have it

111
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,090
I mean where's it gonna end

112
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,860
but anyway so we've been working on this

113
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,410
little project it's not as small anymore

114
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,370
so now in 2017 with support I think it's

115
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,000
about 21 protocol 21 protocols I believe

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,970
and a lot of features and basically what

117
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,620
you want to play with with your else and

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,210
Internet protocols and transfers back

119
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,080
and forth or blah blah blah

120
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,350
a lot of things so when we've been

121
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,800
working on this little project in our

122
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,670
bedrooms and spare time hacks over time

123
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,350
it's not really and you know you're

124
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,580
sitting there in your chambers and

125
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,370
working on your stuff and suddenly you

126
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,400
look around in the world and wow look at

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,590
that there's a lot of people using my

128
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,150
code right when did that happen so and

129
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,680
you start to hear from people that

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,180
they're actually using it and you look

131
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,500
around and you searched if we're helping

132
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,390
you find out that there's a lot of

133
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,870
companies using curves so wow that's and

134
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,240
that's these are sort of companies that

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,100
I've found proven that you're actually

136
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,070
using curve I'm sure that there are one

137
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,470
or two more and and even if you sort of

138
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,120
yeah you're drawn in these names but

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,220
even if you just look at some well-known

140
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,220
brand names those are some really fun

141
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:56,010
brand names it's sort of amazing but so

142
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,130
what would what would all these funny

143
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,920
companies use curl for her and when I

144
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,460
say curl a lot of you a lot of whoever I

145
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,990
talk to they think about the really come

146
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,750
on line tool write all of these these

147
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,250
really using the command line tool know

148
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,020
well we started out a long time ago of

149
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,970
course when Mac OS X store leadership

150
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,140
curl as a default thing in Mac OS so it

151
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,210
ships with curl and lip curve by default

152
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,310
and they have a lot of tools nowadays

153
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,720
that they build themselves that use curl

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,580
and sort of yeah that's a lot of devices

155
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,460
using Mac OS and for some reason TVs are

156
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,409
also very fond of using curl so

157
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,900
basically any TV you have today have

158
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,409
curl in it and I'm done of course or

159
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,440
iPhones and iPads it's default in iOS -

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,570
so that's like what a billion active

161
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,270
devices curl is not default in Android

162
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,180
but I'll show you soon that all of your

163
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,780
Android phones have curly anyway so and

164
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,970
of course it's sort of billion in Linux

165
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,920
Linux service and stuff and writing

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,230
games has turned out to be very popular

167
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,080
too

168
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,910
it's portable so you can move your games

169
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,769
easily and it'll download things on hold

170
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:11,500
for all games and it's been very popular

171
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,240
in version control system plug it stick

172
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,070
yeah you think it and some others and

173
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,579
yeah course begging course you wouldn't

174
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,260
believe that a couple years ago right

175
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,680
why would every single corn either

176
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,279
transfer internet transfer per plant PHP

177
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,140
site supports its default transfer

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,779
library sort of in PHP PHP is what like

179
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,839
a quarter of the internet a lot of

180
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,490
set-top boxes blah blah blah and all

181
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,560
sorts of fun things Facebook right they

182
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,700
use it on the site and I mean as they

183
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,769
say it you've succeeded when you manage

184
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,050
to sort of coined a verb right and I

185
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,339
would say that most people would

186
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,870
actually understand I'm most in this

187
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,670
room I'm sure that many of you would

188
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,440
understand if you'd say just curl it you

189
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,390
wouldn't know what it means it's not

190
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,920
sort of what you do with your hair so

191
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,260
all of this and I mean it's always

192
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,550
interesting so it's a sort of but how

193
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,430
many or actually using this and I all I

194
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,260
get this question a lot how many users

195
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,390
do you have like and I say yeah we are

196
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,829
billions of users but what is it user

197
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,670
really I mean all of those devices I

198
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,320
mean most of you you won't even know

199
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,910
when you're using code right it's just

200
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,070
embedded somewhere so I tend to say that

201
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,120
we have a a bunch of users many and

202
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
looking closer I mean with so all those

203
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,910
things devices of course TVs printers

204
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,660
scanners set up boxes basically all of

205
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,699
you are running curl at least a couple

206
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,970
of times a day and I'd say most of the

207
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,850
world is and I'll show you some fun

208
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,800
since I mean it's a fully open source if

209
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,020
MIT license people are downloading curl

210
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,180
they're building it in their corner and

211
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,290
they're running it and then them and

212
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,450
they never tell me about it right how

213
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,340
would I know when someone is using curl

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,150
I don't know

215
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,640
but sometimes someone figures that out

216
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,470
and send a link who look at what I found

217
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,550
your name in my washing machine and look

218
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,670
so and I started to collect a few and it

219
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,730
this is sort of yeah this is the license

220
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,160
screen in high OS look in every single

221
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,770
iOS device oh that's fun or what is this

222
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,810
ah that's the YouTube app on both iOS

223
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,400
and Android

224
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,590
what's that like 2 billion devices right

225
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,720
or or Skype that's also roughly a

226
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,260
billion stores and what sort of make me

227
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,840
really popular with my kids I could show

228
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,720
them that I'm actually in so that this

229
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
is ending sequence of Grand Theft Auto 5

230
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,420
that makes yes right that was popular

231
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,589
for a few minutes and then they run off

232
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,540
but this is sort of more sort of obscure

233
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,519
things you know you can find these if

234
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,570
you're really really searched for in

235
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,870
this ending sequence this is my name 42

236
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,000
minutes in the into the ending sequence

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,630
I think I'm the only one who ever saw

238
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,389
this well there's a YouTube video of

239
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,630
it's impossible to others but yeah and

240
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,760
other fun things then we can have a this

241
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,940
is a billboard outside Silicon Valley

242
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,980
curl on Billboard and take a moment and

243
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,620
really come online yes what does it do

244
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,990
actually the the ad guy who made this

245
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,600
sign he contacted me later and

246
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,360
apologized doesn't make any sense and

247
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,100
this is a fun this is the Nasdaq

248
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,910
building in New York

249
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,110
and I don't know if you're seeing all

250
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,550
the way in the back but it's a good nice

251
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,020
curl command line in the middle of the

252
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,360
screen and that is actually a command

253
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,610
line you can you could invoke that to

254
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,720
order t-shirt so it's actually a genuine

255
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,580
ad campaign right you want to really see

256
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,530
this but that's this is an excerpt from

257
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,740
the fun email with person at Facebook

258
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,870
when they they tried the patch in

259
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,230
production seems to revive and the patch

260
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,970
in production I think it's extra fun

261
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,920
when it's the Facebook you know one

262
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,020
point nine billion users monthly or

263
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,500
whatever it is and nowadays basically

264
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,870
every mercy this core has curly in it

265
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,000
this License Agreement actually lists

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,890
every core model with a little checkbox

267
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:54,500
if Tasker and why not BMW or Volkswagen

268
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,810
right sky TV this is a team top box or

269
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,730
and Philips television and these are all

270
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,710
funny things but we just come back to

271
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,320
today Instagram and hacking Instagram

272
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,310
and Spotify hacking ring thing having my

273
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,270
name in this scenario since running man

274
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,470
makes interesting other sort of alright

275
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,400
sorry I forgot about PlayStation 4 but I

276
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,350
when people don't have my name well they

277
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,330
can find my name in all these weird

278
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,940
places and it's run into problems they

279
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,300
find my name and then email me so yeah

280
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm really good that GPS is in Toyota

281
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,850
Corollas so if you have any problems

282
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,720
just come to me

283
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,860
I just quoted he wrote it or the person

284
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,130
wrote it to me I assume it's a golden

285
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,910
gem so why why would they use curl our

286
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,500
little thing we made a long time ago

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,160
that's been going on forever well it

288
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,620
turns out that the Internet is sort of a

289
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,500
wild place you can follow the internet

290
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,360
specifications and doing protocols yeah

291
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,670
yeah you know basically every protocol

292
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,110
you're talking over the Internet is

293
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,790
documented in some specification or AB

294
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,190
C's and everything but it turns out that

295
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,440
we're all interpreting creating these

296
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,209
specifications differently and if you

297
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,190
try to use them over the internet you'll

298
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,459
find out that there are a lot of weird

299
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,199
areas and corners you have to sort of

300
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,000
fix and adapt to and it takes time and

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,120
accumulated over time it's not that easy

302
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,660
to just write a new client in in a short

303
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,019
time and we've already done this and it

304
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,529
works sorry wrong way and we're of

305
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,029
course ok so I mean we're here trust

306
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,160
them of course we're open source so it's

307
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,170
easy for anyone and if the fact that is

308
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,630
MIT license makes it extremely easy for

309
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,089
all of these funny commercial companies

310
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,100
because they're never scared about the

311
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,139
license really and we have a

312
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,420
ridiculously stable API you can actually

313
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,019
the first time we made the library we

314
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,600
released it in the in August 2001 and

315
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,730
actually those if you rebuild those

316
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,829
example programs from then they still

317
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:23,649
work exactly as they did then we never

318
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,310
broke those we modify the API or the API

319
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,850
is slightly over time but only very very

320
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,389
old and it's still done a powerful

321
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:37,839
enough API for all of these devices all

322
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,569
of these use cases to actually get get

323
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:44,579
things done transfer data as they want

324
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,130
and

325
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,660
and nowadays well see library yeah yeah

326
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,730
I'm safe language buffer overflows blah

327
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,430
blah blah but it's still the fact that

328
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,640
you cannot get close to the portability

329
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,460
and availability every word with any

330
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,230
other language and you can we see and I

331
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,400
think that has been part of the

332
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,530
popularity that you can build this for

333
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,020
basically any operating system and any

334
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,750
CPU can you can think of at least if it

335
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,359
is CPU has 32 bits or more and you can

336
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,579
run curl on it and that's that's

337
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,530
powerful that means that you can write

338
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,910
your programs basically put it

339
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,710
everywhere and it'll still work the same

340
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,920
and you slip curl the same way and then

341
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,569
of course we have I think we're like

342
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,730
bindings for 45 languages so you can

343
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,310
pick your own language and we have

344
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,770
documentation the good thing I think

345
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,110
with maintaining the API over the years

346
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,780
is that we can maintain the

347
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,030
documentation the documentation

348
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,510
documents the same API yeah it's this

349
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,640
instability and it has a lot of

350
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,620
protocols it turns out that you should

351
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,600
actually use more than one protocol when

352
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,570
they do internet transfers so we try to

353
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,240
ask our users like roughly nearly how

354
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,130
many protocols do you actually use we'd

355
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,630
curve because it's sometimes it seems

356
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,340
ridiculous to keep supporting all these

357
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,470
weird protocols why would we do that

358
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,460
but it turns out that users are actually

359
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,320
very keen on using many protocols in

360
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,330
their in their code it's C code it's

361
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,230
really only there to transfer stuff it

362
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,710
is very fast it's usually as fast as you

363
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,020
can get I mean apart from the network

364
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,820
being a slow bottleneck often

365
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,100
since we're talking about all these

366
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,990
embedded devices most of them have

367
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,390
gotten the carb source code they built

368
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,919
it for their device and they're running

369
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,210
with it that also means that they're

370
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,030
sort of they they enjoy having things

371
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,679
like you know disabling features they

372
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,559
don't want in their car or TV and so

373
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,000
they can usually shave off size and

374
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,020
features they don't like or don't want

375
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,120
and we have an how many TLS libraries

376
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,780
can you mention when you get up in the

377
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,460
morning we support 12 TLS libraries and

378
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,309
that's a hard challenge to you just

379
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,059
mention all of them it's also sort of an

380
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,950
this also goes with it it makes it

381
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,270
really attractive for all these device

382
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,650
manufacturers because they usually

383
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,690
prefer one of the libraries and they

384
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,059
won't have the small one or the feature

385
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,890
full one or the one that goes with the

386
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,230
best license or whatever and it makes it

387
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,470
really handy for all of these to pick

388
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,480
the one you want build curve with it'll

389
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,809
just fly and okay I mean where trust

390
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,450
them so maybe why anyone would do

391
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,100
anything open-source isn't really a

392
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,960
surprise to you and we're all sort of

393
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,039
yeah of course it would be able to

394
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,450
source but I still want to just first

395
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,120
iterate over this that I get this a lot

396
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,690
when I tell someone you know yeah

397
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,330
billions of devices cool right and why

398
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,669
would you I do that open source if if if

399
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,100
I got just a tiny amount of money for

400
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,230
every installation right I would be a

401
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,870
millionaire or whatever but you all know

402
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,190
that it doesn't work like that and it

403
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,600
was never an alternative and it had

404
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,549
never been anything near whether you say

405
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,710
see I mean I haven't done this myself

406
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,890
and I always enjoyed sort of the

407
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,289
atmosphere of open-source I appreciated

408
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,940
the day I learned about it and I always

409
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,289
wanted to contribute back and it's

410
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,299
always been like that and it's always

411
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,059
been a team effort and now I wouldn't be

412
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,280
rich anyway

413
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,760
so that's basically sort of what it is

414
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
and I just want to explain a little bit

415
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,610
about how this is done then we're a

416
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,910
small project we were never big we're

417
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,610
still small but counted together if you

418
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,200
accumulate over the years we have

419
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,330
roughly 1500 names in this sort of thank

420
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,180
you file which is a lot of names most of

421
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,440
all helpers or contributors that have

422
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,180
contributed something like once and

423
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,190
never came back and that's fine but

424
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,570
they're still in there so we have about

425
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,970
30 to 40 contributors per release and we

426
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,270
do releases every eight weeks so every

427
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,760
other month we're really really small

428
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:23,060
for team possibly five so and we're all

429
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,340
volunteers there's no particular

430
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,600
commercial backing here there's no big

431
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,120
company there's no there's really no

432
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,580
money at all mo and we're of course

433
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,890
we're doing things like you know opus or

434
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,630
style everything is publican we have

435
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,160
mailing lists and right we're on on

436
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,150
github these days

437
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,710
so what I usually when when I try to it

438
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,600
goes back to little that you know and

439
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,370
you know I'm not a millionaire I don't

440
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,370
give money for this trying to explain

441
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,110
this to an outsider yeah yeah but okay

442
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,580
but who pays for all of this right

443
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,500
there's some happen to be some

444
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,750
organization there's there's a lot of

445
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,980
code all those devices are running

446
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,680
Carwood who sets this up and what's the

447
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,800
organizational charge and everything but

448
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,780
we're we're a bunch of spare time

449
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,280
hackers it's never change

450
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,420
well these days I Mac you know I'm

451
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,700
employed by Mozilla and I get to spend a

452
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,540
part of my work time on Carl so that is

453
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,820
to some extent company backing but apart

454
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,340
from that we're all just doing it on her

455
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,059
our spare times I'm sure that we have a

456
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,679
lot of contributors who are actually

457
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,559
doing I mean they're using curl at work

458
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,590
and fix bugs or add features for their

459
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,309
employers and send them back to us but I

460
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,570
don't know and we don't keep track about

461
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,460
in the reserves saurabh they're not

462
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,400
really affecting the the trajectory of

463
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,160
the project or anything we've had a few

464
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
companies over the years who actually

465
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,940
through sort of step up and pay someone

466
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,670
to work on a feature I implemented SFTP

467
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,280
and SCP support for by combo for a

468
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,890
company who said we'll pay for your time

469
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,140
I worked on a shippi to support a while

470
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,210
ago also like that the company stepped

471
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,610
up and say I will pay your work time for

472
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:29,070
awhile if you do this that's fine but

473
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,800
really if you want to have in this sort

474
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,559
of scenario companies only pay for

475
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,150
feature development there's nobody's

476
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,770
going to step up but hey we'll pay you

477
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,040
for fixing bugs for a year no that

478
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,629
doesn't happen now hasn't happened yet

479
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,590
right but basically so how do you you'd

480
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,090
write software that get used by a

481
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,820
billion people or more it's it's there's

482
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,100
nothing magic to this at all

483
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,730
it is plain old simple software

484
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,770
engineering you just have to write

485
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,800
something it should be a bit useful you

486
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,720
know review that's good

487
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,570
test it write some decent documentation

488
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,460
documentation is you know we all know

489
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,580
this but it's still not as common as we

490
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,900
would like it to be but it's really are

491
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,780
useful and important to get it to get

492
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,010
something popular it needs to be

493
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,510
understood and you can just do it you

494
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,280
need to document it and then we release

495
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,980
often and then we start over again and

496
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,690
you just it's rate like that for a long

497
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,620
long time and it'll be a success in the

498
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,790
end hopefully well that's how it worked

499
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:53,000
out for us so and when okay billions of

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,370
devices you all have like three devices

501
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,500
running my code

502
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:04,060
do you trust it really or

503
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:09,110
will curl give us the next heartbleed

504
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,230
sort of yeah yeah that's same well

505
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,890
roughly the same code in many many many

506
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,750
many places what happens when you

507
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,169
someone figures out the way to trigger

508
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,190
some nastiness in vast amount of devices

509
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,570
I wouldn't be too fun so yeah right I

510
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,010
hope but what do I know I'm just wanting

511
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,840
to mention that we're of course aware of

512
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,399
the situation sort of it there's some

513
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,860
sense of responsibility sort of that

514
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,549
yeah one who once you have when you have

515
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,020
just a few users you know you could just

516
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,000
do another release tomorrow or next week

517
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,130
it's fine just upgrade everybody but

518
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,250
suddenly when you're sort of letting

519
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,590
this whole billions of devices really

520
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,760
sink in devices so we're of course doing

521
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,700
reviews we review it as much as possible

522
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,730
I can't say that we review every single

523
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,720
commit but a lot of them and we learn

524
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,240
that having strict guidelines on code

525
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,770
style has turned out to be really useful

526
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,779
so we're sort of over time we're being

527
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:24,980
more and more strict that you should

528
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,240
follow the coast Isle it doesn't matter

529
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,419
if you like it or not having a common

530
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,480
stylus helps for readability for

531
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,450
security and for understanding things so

532
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,130
that's what we're going for

533
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,840
and of course documentation so we should

534
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,130
document everything so that you actually

535
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,539
understand what you're doing when you're

536
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,279
changing things and why you would change

537
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,220
things and and and perhaps you would

538
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,110
understand api's properly when you're

539
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,539
using them students inadvertently cause

540
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,549
problems like that and we test as much

541
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,049
as possible testing is of course always

542
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:58,070
hard we use valgrind as much as possible

543
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,880
on tests we do we do start the code

544
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,950
analyzing as

545
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,900
as much as we can I would say we use

546
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,890
Coverity and we use clang analyzer a lot

547
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,140
yeah and be part of that the Google OSS

548
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,180
fasting project now and we're doing some

549
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,130
other manifestations of it starting with

550
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,190
that and we just recently had a code or

551
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,250
date by the Mozilla open source secure

552
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,440
software refer to whatever is called the

553
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,490
M OSS and that's a great effort by the

554
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,250
way they so we got a grant and they

555
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,310
could pay a company a lot of money to

556
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,830
spend a lot of time reading curl source

557
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,960
code and they found a lot of problems

558
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,430
and reported them back and we fix them

559
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,620
and hopefully we learned something from

560
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,230
that and we try to not to reproduce the

561
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,070
same problems in the future

562
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,300
let's hope that works

563
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:02,830
nah I think you'll do right so that's

564
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,270
what we do in order to fix or rather

565
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,010
make sure that we don't get a lot of

566
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,220
problems because right we have right now

567
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,150
60 CVS I think and Counting I'm sure

568
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,160
that we will have more we have more in

569
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,480
the pipe but as always I don't think

570
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,280
anyone should ever judge a project by

571
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,870
the number of CVS not only because we

572
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,060
have 60 but number of Seabees is never

573
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,310
an important calendar it's what you do

574
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,290
with the CVS how you handle this that's

575
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,960
what's important you all know that and I

576
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,460
know that too and that's sort of what

577
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,780
we're trying to make in this project

578
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,980
just make sure that we have to take care

579
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,360
of those the best possible way so I just

580
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,420
wanted to sort of make it more about me

581
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,060
then so Carl started when Kurt wasn't

582
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,520
really the I mean Carl was the third

583
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,050
name of the project so it started in

584
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,360
1998 as Carl so I've been doing this for

585
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,540
a while

586
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,870
it has sort of sort of marked my entire

587
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,970
life

588
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,470
this is my primary hobby this is what I

589
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,520
do sometimes when I when people report

590
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,040
problems or they say this sucks

591
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,190
and then I said no and they say well you

592
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,680
shouldn't take it as personal and then

593
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,350
this then it feels of course it's

594
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,660
personal I just told you I spent 20

595
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,880
years on this 20 years and I work on

596
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,230
this two hours every day roughly

597
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,540
sometimes more sometimes little less two

598
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,790
hours per day in 20 years

599
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:49,620
right that's yeah I guess I get to work

600
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,970
extra much extra uncurl houses mozilla

601
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,420
pays me for it as well so sort of just

602
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,320
accumulating this I spent a lot of time

603
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,450
on this so possibly that is part of

604
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,610
explanation why I actually sort of got

605
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,000
somewhere by now and I must say that

606
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,740
looking at ways that feels good that at

607
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,990
least those 14,000 hours wasn't

608
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,950
completely wasted most of those emails

609
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:29,640
probably okay but so then people tend to

610
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,060
ask me you okay them but why why keep up

611
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,170
with been doing this for 20 years right

612
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,890
but

613
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,990
I really cannot put the finger on it

614
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,010
anyone in any way other than yes just so

615
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,970
much fun you know

616
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,250
believers is something and and making

617
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,200
sure that it works and people appreciate

618
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,210
it and it just runs everywhere

619
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,280
that's an awful I'm sorry that's an

620
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,770
awesome feeling and you real yeah and

621
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,870
then someone reports a bag yeah we can't

622
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,610
have that and then we continue on

623
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,520
someone answer feature struck me that we

624
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,170
really need another feature and we add

625
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,120
that and we are the bug we need to fix

626
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,960
that and that's just how it is we just

627
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,549
move on like every other project it

628
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:19,090
never ends and right everyone needs a

629
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,059
hobby right but because I often get the

630
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,299
question right 14,000 hours right that's

631
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,730
a complete waste because what if you had

632
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,710
gotten just a little little hourly rate

633
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,410
on that time you would earn a lot of

634
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,679
money but but I try to get the focus

635
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,950
back on this being a hobby most of most

636
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,929
people at least in sort of in work in

637
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,410
our sort of Western world most people

638
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,970
have some sort of hobby you spend time

639
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,280
you go golfing your go canoeing or you

640
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
go walking in the woods

641
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,179
that's hobbies right that's also Hobbit

642
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,770
you just spend a lot of time in front of

643
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,610
a computer and writing curve so yeah

644
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,040
it's just the most fun I can imagine

645
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,740
right and then when I've explained that

646
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,160
they look at me a bit weird so yeah yeah

647
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,160
yeah you're a strange person anyway so

648
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,450
but seriously isn't it ever done right

649
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,720
20 years and it's just the command-line

650
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,309
tool right and then a lot of people tell

651
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,260
me that yeah I used to call command-line

652
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,450
tool in 2005 the first time or something

653
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,340
like that and still works the same wait

654
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,559
wait you can use the same options you

655
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,130
use them they work now what happened did

656
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,530
you spend 15 more years from making

657
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,580
those same options work

658
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,050
not exactly but yeah if he's like that

659
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,960
sometimes but anyway we're of course

660
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,110
always having heading forward upwards

661
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,340
onwards and since we're celebrating

662
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,310
actually 19 years as a project in a

663
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,160
month we're actually having our first

664
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,180
curl meetup meeting in the real world in

665
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,290
Germany in March so if you're into Karl

666
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,770
check it out

667
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,760
but other things than happening apart

668
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
from us meeting in Germany there's a

669
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,730
future for for curl because no it's

670
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,730
never really never done it's never

671
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,620
completed it's never finished there are

672
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,410
always bugs and as you know the internet

673
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,690
didn't really stop at any point during

674
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,900
these 20 years so the internet is keep

675
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,650
is keeping up I mean it keeps changing

676
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,750
it keeps evolving and we need to keep

677
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,400
evolving with that too in order to sort

678
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,470
of work the way the rest of the Internet

679
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,330
does and make sure that everyone can do

680
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,370
what they what they want to do on the

681
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,730
current internet and the future internet

682
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,380
things like new protocol versions and

683
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,180
new ways to do things and better ways to

684
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,900
use compressions and blah blah blah I

685
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,030
mean we introduced a cheapy to a few

686
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,370
years ago we're going to introduce the

687
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,100
next protocols as soon as possible

688
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,649
4:13 mozilla room i'll tell you

689
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:12,299
something about the next verticals and

690
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,329
of course this is open source

691
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,119
it'll just survive and it'll keep

692
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,980
iterating it doesn't matter if I get run

693
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,540
over by the bus tomorrow or just get

694
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,819
bored and just go home it'll be there

695
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:27,489
he'll still iterate so it doesn't this

696
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:32,079
doesn't sort of depend on me and there's

697
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,869
truly no slowdown in sight if you're

698
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,579
looking at sort of commit traits or line

699
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,440
of cut lines of code or anything it's

700
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,589
just going and going and going and of

701
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,770
course you can help just joining and fix

702
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,949
the bugs

703
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,510
so I wanted to show you then a little

704
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,869
peek of our roadmap going forward so

705
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,579
this is sort of where how the magic is

706
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:59,369
made in this project there this

707
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,530
now the secret is out right

708
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:14,840
[Applause]

709
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,000
so we have quite a lot of time I talk so

710
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,619
fast or so little or whatever it is so

711
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,450
if you have any questions there are some

712
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,309
mics or one mic a taste or something hi

713
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,500
thanks for talking have you ever been

714
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,220
approached by a government agency or any

715
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,130
other organization to build a back door

716
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,349
into curl thank you for that lovely

717
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:59,960
question if I had been contacted by a

718
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,730
good foreign government to insert

719
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,849
backdoors in my code how would you know

720
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,750
but if they had approached me I wouldn't

721
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,250
tell you anyway right so I myself just

722
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,050
to meet you you go and review the code

723
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:25,000
and tell me if you find it out well no I

724
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,250
have not I have not been approached by a

725
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,680
government or company or anyone to do

726
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,540
anything of any sort of bad faith in not

727
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,910
in the code and not using the code in

728
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,430
any way actually we are all friendly

729
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,510
most hello does anyone still use his

730
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,020
gopher

731
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,500
i but i every year when I ask this

732
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,540
question to curl users what are you

733
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,130
using in curl I asked them what

734
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,809
protocols are you using in curve and

735
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,300
there are always people marking that

736
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,599
gopher and it makes me curious if

737
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,250
they're actually marking the gopher

738
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,140
because they're using it or because they

739
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,510
think I should keep it so I'm not sure

740
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,109
but actually last time they gopher was

741
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,089
not the least used protocol out of the

742
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:22,640
protocols we support so I guess kind of

743
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,890
following on from that about all the

744
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,420
protocols you had to implement which

745
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,730
would you say you spent the most time on

746
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,339
it or has been the most difficult and I

747
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:36,880
guess second part why is that Samba and

748
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,050
serve all the protocols that you've had

749
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,780
to implement as part the coal project

750
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,829
which would you say you've spent the

751
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,839
most time on which is taken the longest

752
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:51,079
to implement the longest the longest to

753
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,180
write support for the longest disappear

754
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,820
yeah I mean none of them ever stops

755
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,440
being supported and none of them really

756
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,410
stops being developed so I think all

757
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,630
protocols that are the most used they're

758
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,440
also sort of most abused or most most

759
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,090
different flavors of them in the world

760
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,720
so like trying to support HTTP that's a

761
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,880
never ending game and that'll never stop

762
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,530
and it will never be fully compliant

763
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,450
with everything in the world so so I'm

764
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,180
not sure that we ever stopped developing

765
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,460
sort of the HP support is going to be

766
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,320
forever so if I was going to name one

767
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,970
protocol that is the hardest to support

768
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,980
that is I should be because it's a it's

769
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,260
a Wild West to support it hi thank you

770
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,750
for lib Carl do you think HTTP 2 will

771
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:52,070
finally take over HTTP everywhere I'll

772
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,520
talk about that in Mozilla room but yeah

773
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,870
HTTP 2 is as it was made by the

774
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,630
browser's only supporting s52 over HTTP

775
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,030
that is encrypted and if you're looking

776
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,740
at if you're counting traffic in

777
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,210
checking with Firefox records today

778
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,430
actually more than half of all the

779
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,130
connections over HTTP is using it to be

780
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,160
too so it is already at least on its way

781
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,680
towards that I don't think it'll ever

782
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,200
truly reach a hundred percent because it

783
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,290
should be one and even I mean I should

784
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,820
be one at one and HP don't want to zero

785
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,770
is going to remain in servers for a very

786
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,400
very long time but there will also be

787
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,870
new contenders after HTTP 2 so maybe HTP

788
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,810
two will only be here for a period of

789
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,280
time until the next one

790
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,890
the places that you be - ok hypothetical

791
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,590
situation the last license with your

792
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,310
name in it has just been written what

793
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,350
year is it and why is no-one using girl

794
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,270
anymore

795
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,920
sorry just just I'm asking you to

796
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,870
predict the death of Carl why like under

797
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,670
what circumstances will someone will

798
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,620
will curl not be used anymore

799
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,150
I can't hear the question sorry Wyatt

800
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,300
like why will like what what would cause

801
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,760
Carlton no longer be used like its own

802
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,310
billion devices why would it stop being

803
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,890
used ever is it because a new tool comes

804
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,320
along it is it because you are like no

805
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,300
longer supporting it like there are

806
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,190
massive open-source project what causes

807
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,430
it to die that's a really good question

808
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,060
and I think it's sort of as I never

809
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,220
really understood why you took off it's

810
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,270
like I don't know but I would imagine it

811
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,070
that if I just listen in to what people

812
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,410
are saying than people I mean the

813
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,630
constant mantra I get in my face every

814
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,610
time I say something about Lib Cardiff

815
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,410
yeah it's written in C right buffer

816
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,810
overflows bad bad bad so someone would

817
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,030
would say that yeah the future of the

818
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,400
lib curl like would be another language

819
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,500
that would be a safe language and then

820
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,060
everything would be grand and much

821
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,150
better you can hear from my voice that I

822
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,830
don't really believe in that but maybe

823
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,920
maybe that'll be what challenged it and

824
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,700
replaces it eventually it's really hard

825
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,160
to tell because I'm the ones are using

826
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,900
it today they're using it for a reason

827
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,090
and maybe those will fail for some

828
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,970
reason and some other devices or

829
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,680
manufactures will suddenly pick up

830
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,300
something else and become much bigger I

831
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,430
don't know it's really hard to tell and

832
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,920
for me it doesn't really matter I'll

833
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,570
just run this for as long as I think

834
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,230
it's fun

835
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,720
maybe I'll get bored of it someday maybe

836
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm not but and maybe I mean it is good

837
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,350
with competitors so it's fine as long as

838
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,690
we should have many many competitors

839
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,400
that wouldn't be good for the ecosystem

840
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,860
so fine may make more competitors

841
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,670
that'll be great

842
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,029
I thanks for the talk all those devices

843
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:06,849
with your code in many many of them

844
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:09,430
never could be updated and so there's

845
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,109
gonna be bugs and maybe some serious

846
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:16,869
ones how do you feel about that yeah we

847
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:19,569
have that's a sort of a major problem I

848
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:21,309
think in the project that we have some

849
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,859
of these producers and of devices they

850
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,079
have really really really long upgrade

851
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,809
cycles like decades sometimes someone

852
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,670
shows up on the mailing list and asks us

853
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,710
about hey I have a bug in this version

854
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,539
all right we release that 14 years ago

855
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:38,890
no no we don't want to update we just

856
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,950
want the fix so yeah but I don't think I

857
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,380
mean I think that's a pity and I think

858
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,499
that sort of it's drains our resources

859
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:51,910
and everything because I think yeah

860
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,309
we've fixed like we fix on average I

861
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:59,470
think about 400 bugs every year like 10

862
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,069
years right that you have in your code

863
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:06,279
you should upgrade so I don't know I

864
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,170
can't really affect that I can only

865
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,960
suggest to them that they may be upgrade

866
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,099
sooner or consider this but I also think

867
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,079
it sort of drives in the other direction

868
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,230
as well again if you ever want to have

869
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,970
some fun you should follow me on Twitter

870
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,079
and discuss your L syntax that is sort

871
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,960
of a thing that since we have devices

872
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,839
using the internet with very very long

873
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,880
update cycles we also need things to

874
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,180
actually be somewhat stable URLs

875
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,569
shouldn't change over time this URL we

876
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:42,970
have today should work in ten years as

877
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,559
long as the servers and everything is

878
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,480
there the syntax to then change the

879
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,849
protocol that the things we do today

880
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:51,220
they should still work even in the

881
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,578
future

882
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,780
I talking about command line

883
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,760
applications rather than the library

884
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,910
what do you think of w get and do you

885
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,529
think it does anything better than Co I

886
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,500
like to maintain the image that we're in

887
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,920
a fierce struggle sort of the curl w get

888
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,870
worse w yet is an excellent command line

889
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,730
to forgetting things of the internet

890
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,550
using a bunch of those at least two

891
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,890
protocols that curl also supports and it

892
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,260
does a lot of other things so I think

893
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,060
the W get is a great project and a great

894
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,910
tool everyone should use it it has a

895
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,090
small overlap in features with Carl but

896
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,560
looking at what both projects can do

897
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,170
that overlap isn't particularly large so

898
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,450
by all means use whatever tool you would

899
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,070
like the best tool for the job

900
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:50,700
or like hi thank you for the code okay

901
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,470
if you had to start over like from the

902
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,970
beginning with just a blank draft we do

903
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,360
something better or just something

904
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,190
marginally better than the current curve

905
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,370
because you said that there's like 50000

906
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,340
commits something like that and it's

907
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,980
it's very huge and I can think of so big

908
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,290
huge codebase without you know some

909
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,150
design flow you want to fix or something

910
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,610
that you let him you cut and you never

911
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,520
fix it because it just worked which is

912
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,190
do you want to have like starts all over

913
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,680
again and do something better or is not

914
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,520
just not possible

915
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,460
I mean engineer is always attractive to

916
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,290
consider the case yeah yeah throw out

917
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,600
the rubbish just sort of clean plate and

918
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,270
build a new nice house the way we see it

919
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,420
now that should work but but I always

920
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,280
resist that because I don't think that

921
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,340
is a very long-term solution

922
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,770
everything is gonna be iterative all the

923
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,180
time so even if I would rewrite

924
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,550
everything today it would still be an

925
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,710
iterative process in years time so I

926
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,930
don't really ever consider throwing

927
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,610
everything out and starting over I'm

928
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,319
always in Polish

929
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,559
what we have making sure that we change

930
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,390
things so that it becomes better without

931
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,759
rewriting everything from scratch so

932
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:16,599
it's really for me it's more of a no I

933
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,019
would never start over that's basically

934
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:26,430
not going to happen but so did we do

935
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,660
decisions in the beginning and and

936
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,789
things that were stupid that we're

937
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,249
suffering from today yes with it and

938
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,549
maybe a bunch of those decisions and the

939
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:37,749
choices we should have done it

940
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:38,949
differently and we would have been

941
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:42,549
happier today but yeah but who doesn't

942
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,910
I mean who don't do stupid decisions

943
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,589
through life right we just have to live

944
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:49,509
with them and sort of make up for them

945
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,249
over time and it tends to work out

946
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:56,939
anyway Thanks

947
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,790
no more questions

948
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,970
4:30 in the Mozilla

949
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,410
thank you

950
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:19,160
[Applause]
