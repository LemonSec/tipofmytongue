[Music]

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:01:01,940
like me seven cups so I am Christopher

3
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,610
gray as Alex also introduced me

4
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm Missoula Tech speaker and also as

5
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,600
representative I am the member of the

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,470
labs which is a local hackerspace that

7
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,560
[Music]

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,340
and I also finished my studies this year

9
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,590
for international affairs and diplomacy

10
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm going to start a presentation

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,060
first of all with some numbers because

12
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,210
it has to do like with the women with

13
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,250
involvement of women in open source

14
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,300
projects and in the surgery d'arnot 2002

15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,670
it was the number of women of the

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,300
contributors were only 1.1 percent but

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,760
then on 2013 the number 11 percent so we

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,159
can see that the number is higher but

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
it's still not the number that we were

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,229
fighting for and not the amount that we

21
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,450
would like to see in floss communities

22
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,580
and only 1.5 percent of the free and

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,069
open source software developers are

24
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,480
female and related to the github

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,720
users 5.4% of get up users with over 10

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,150
contributors from a random sample are

27
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,090
female and among women who joined the

28
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,920
tech industry

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,310
56% sleeve by mid-career which is double

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,860
the attrition rate for men usually the

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,200
reasons that they leave the career buy

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,750
in the new age is because they have to

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,540
take care the children when they become

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,030
moment all the energy goes somewhere

35
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,560
else like not in this area and here are

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
the numbers of the ripples that are done

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,650
with like from the female and from the

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,049
male as you can see from the chart the

39
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,380
number of the women is like really

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,630
really low related to the contributions

41
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,099
of the number of the repositories and

42
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,900
also some issues that we see that why

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,230
does this low number come from first of

44
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,880
all there is a beauty like there are a

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,630
lot of cases and women actually very

46
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,319
diverse people behave like they're not

47
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,569
there and they usually try to avoid

48
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,780
their contact and in this way they do

49
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,799
not really feel very comfortable to to

50
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,400
go on and to express like themselves

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,650
especially in gender and gender

52
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,269
assumption reason and social

53
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,180
expectations and sexualize are also some

54
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,850
other issues the stereotypes there in

55
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,040
the society that women cannot really do

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,470
the tasks that are meant for men is also

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,680
a very big problem because this affects

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,290
a lot on the self-esteem since they

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,120
think that they will not be capable to

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,000
do something that is a lament for men

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,660
and usually they also do not feel well

62
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,418
when they are in an environment and they

63
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,200
are expected to be valued firm for their

64
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,980
information and for and for their work

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,760
but they get you know compliments or

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,590
opinions or in Oh words that are not

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,930
related to their work but to something

68
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,350
else a very motive initiative is done

69
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,380
related to this Mozilla has an issue

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,970
initiative code willows and it's only

71
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,970
for women in Missoula it's a community

72
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,560
composed of members from different

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,290
open-source projects when they can all

74
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,310
gather their shared their opinions

75
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,600
various sites related to different

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,740
experiences so this way when we exchange

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,870
you know the penis this will help us

78
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,250
improve our work and have also a better

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,340
performance like doing different tasks

80
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,750
it is mainly dedicated to improving

81
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,060
women's visibility and involvement in

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,330
free and open-source and it's free so

83
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,130
everyone can participate

84
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,680
despite their background or if they come

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,010
from a technical and non-technical it's

86
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,620
also written in our manifesto that it's

87
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,020
a research that inheres ourselves that

88
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,840
must remain open and accessible so this

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,470
is also in our Constitution that mozilla

90
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,350
and it's open like to everyone is very

91
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,060
active group full of ideas takes to do

92
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,550
and we discussed a lot of topics there

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,450
are a lot of channels that we go and

94
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,930
that people can have information from we

95
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,730
have our gene you can find us on

96
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,350
Facebook I will see channel telegram

97
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,040
mailing list and in your state so if you

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,920
live in the country and you have like a

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Mozilla community there you can join and

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,330
you can see there there might be a group

101
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,150
that are only for women or for people

102
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,090
from underrepresented groups that can be

103
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,490
part of Earth or if there isn't any

104
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,620
group like that you can feel free to

105
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,110
start there to start a new one there are

106
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,630
a lot of initiatives that are going

107
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,240
parallel with the roamers there there is

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,480
also the outreach e i know if you

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,640
read about it but it's a intership that

110
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,650
is like for three months and it's paid

111
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,380
and it's only for imminent for people

112
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,990
from underrepresented groups there are a

113
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,880
lot of projects which aims to like and

114
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,560
which contributes in the outreaches so

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,940
they can get interest and to really

116
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,680
truly aspire them to Virginia their work

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,140
as I mentioned you in the beginning in I

118
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,600
we have a local hackerspace back in

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,670
Albania and the situation is like

120
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,740
completely different from the outer

121
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,440
space or from the other floss

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,660
communities like around Europe as far as

123
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,050
I've seen

124
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,470
and there are 70% of the contributors

125
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,710
are women so like there is a higher

126
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,380
number of women than men that do

127
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,620
contribute in Flast like in mozilla in

128
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,740
fedora in linux and in OpenStreetMap so

129
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,290
the men are in minorities and this also

130
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,770
comes from the educational system this

131
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,540
effects about the educational system

132
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,950
like they do really inspire the women

133
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,650
especially to go into study tech because

134
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,380
it's seen also as a field that despite

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,270
that you can have a good career which

136
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,940
will help you like in the future it will

137
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,020
it's also is well-paid and you can you

138
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,380
can like reach and you can go like how

139
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,930
far that you want like relate to this

140
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,920
but during Poland without reaches there

141
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,910
are also other other projects that do

142
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,760
inspire women to participate in like

143
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,470
there is for example google Summer of

144
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,200
Code or other internships that are

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
really mainly and focused only to

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,650
empower and to make the people coming

147
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,140
from underrepresented groups to express

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,150
and to share like their experience and I

149
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,640
thought without the fear of being judged

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,420
and just to live how they really

151
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,300
understood how they really want and

152
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,750
communities like this so this was like

153
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,200
for my part now please welcome my

skill that our teacher today which is

168
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,510
called active listening can help you in

169
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,740
different areas of your career and

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,850
notice that since I learned this skill

171
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,730
my emotional intelligence have highly

172
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,740
improved so that is why I believe that

173
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,210
it's very important that you take this

174
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,400
next 10 minutes to pay attention to what

175
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,840
I have to say and you know that there's

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,940
research that says that only 2% of

177
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,280
people have done classes about listening

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,510
and we do classes every day about

179
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,120
writing and we do classes about reading

180
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,220
we were never taught how to listen and

181
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,640
that also is a skill and that is what

182
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,140
one thing that we are going to learn

183
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,030
today and hopefully you'll be part of

184
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,420
that 2% that has done a formal class in

185
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,330
listening so one thing that is very

186
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,880
important in listening is your body

187
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,160
language because for example if you are

188
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
talking to someone and yeah and when the

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,810
person is talking to you you're doing

190
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,210
the research the person you think that

191
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,800
you're bored so then they'll start like

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,170
crap in teens and crap in imported

193
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,300
information so your body language plays

194
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,280
a very important role but unfortunately

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,810
because of that we won't touch on that

196
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,470
now I will touch on specific aspect

197
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,060
which is listening

198
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,100
let me first say the difference of

199
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,660
hearing and listening hearing is the act

200
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,240
of perceiving sounds for example you are

201
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,260
in this room right now

202
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,210
you're sharing different noises

203
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,820
you're perceiving different sounds but

204
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,560
that doesn't mean that you are listening

205
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,050
to each and every sound the person or

206
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,910
the sound that you concentrate on that

207
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,670
you actually set your ears on and you

208
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,250
process what that thing or person is

209
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,720
saying is the person whom you are

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,250
listening to for example if you're

211
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,350
listening to what I'm saying and you're

212
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,300
processing it that means that you are

213
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,490
listening to me and that is more active

214
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,279
than hearing that happens like without

215
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,010
you even needing to do anything

216
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,330
subconsciously what I'm going to talk to

217
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,160
specific is active listening and active

218
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,770
listening is a skill which is what it

219
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,930
says active listening listening actively

220
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,130
and trying to understand deeply the

221
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,350
person that you're talking to these are

222
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,930
some of the benefits of it I'll just say

223
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,670
one for example like it improves your

224
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,460
interpersonal skills because the more

225
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,170
you are able to listen to people the

226
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,360
more people like you because people like

227
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,830
to talk a lot about themselves or the

228
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,300
things they'll do so if you can listen

229
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,760
to them then they'll most likely like

230
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,510
you and then another thing but here also

231
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,790
are some of the disadvantages of active

232
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,320
listening in specific because there is a

233
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,550
technique called mirroring

234
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,880
where you try to rephrase what someone

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,680
is saying and when you always rephrase

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,750
what someone is saying even though

237
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,730
that's helpful in some way it can also

238
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,709
sound like parity like you're a pirate

239
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,209
and you are repeating repeating whatever

240
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,310
the person is saying so that is one of

241
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,110
the disadvantages here more than you can

242
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,270
see and what I'm going to say now I've

243
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,070
break it into three sections into

244
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,110
comprehension retention and response

245
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,390
when you're talking to someone during a

246
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,490
research you won't actually comprehend

247
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,300
what they are saying

248
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,920
so to comprehend what they're saying

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,540
there are different skills once of them

250
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,279
one of the things that you can use is

251
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,740
reflection reflection is when someone

252
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,410
tells you something you try to reflect

253
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,610
back what they are saying

254
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,820
for example someone tells you that I'm

255
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,040
very excited so reflection is saying so

256
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
it's you saying so you mean that you are

257
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,660
very excited today right that is

258
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,339
reflection another thing is

259
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,890
clarification to get clarification you

260
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,209
can do different things one of them is

261
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,520
asking open-ended or close and their

262
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,040
questions and I'll get into

263
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,770
explanation of those things in the next

264
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,870
few minutes one thing that I want to

265
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,700
emphasize on right now is this technique

266
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,940
here response which helps you get more a

267
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,160
better response from the user is called

268
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,670
funneling funnel in and with that

269
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,260
technique what you do is you are

270
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,600
actually trying to extract more general

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,580
information from someone or more

272
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,370
specific information from someone and to

273
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,290
do that I'll use an example of FOSDEM

274
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,600
for example someone tells you I'll be

275
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,820
attending for them if you ask the person

276
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,600
tell me more about this that is asking

277
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,330
some things asking something that will

278
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,830
give you more general information

279
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,870
because when you say tell me more about

280
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,060
it so now give you a general information

281
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,840
about it but let me say what time are

282
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
you going to first them and which talk

283
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,250
are you going to attend that is more

284
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,820
specific and by asking this question you

285
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,890
are asking you are getting more specific

286
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,740
information so that is one way you can

287
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,500
use this technique called funnel in

288
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,660
right now I have a similar here that I

289
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,080
will run through it fast so in this

290
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,330
scenario I'm conducting a research to

291
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,070
identify why there is under

292
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,710
representation of a specific minority

293
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,840
group in the open-source community that

294
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,500
can be like maybe woman or people from a

295
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,150
specific race or people from a specific

296
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,330
gender just about anything and through

297
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,030
this demonstration I'll show you how you

298
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,710
can use the skill called active

299
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,350
listening to get more information from

300
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,500
that person so for example we are in the

301
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,420
interview and I the interviewer I'm

302
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,730
saying hello my name is Gloria I'm from

303
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,010
this company and today I'm conducting

304
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,250
this research is that okay with you

305
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,590
the person said yes thank you very much

306
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,840
is that okay with you makes you

307
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,520
understand if the person is ready for

308
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,450
your research

309
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,420
so by asking that question it helps the

310
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,550
person feel more comfortable that okay

311
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,630
yes I'm ready

312
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,510
when they answer yes I'm ready let's

313
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,240
start so as I move on

314
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,220
during the conversation I tell the

315
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,660
person to tell me a bit about their

316
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,600
background that things help the person

317
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,580
to open up to me because when I tell

318
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,500
them tell me

319
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,540
your background the person now starts

320
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,360
diving into their life and the more

321
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,910
personal things that they share the more

322
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,280
closer to me they feel and the more they

323
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,190
trust me so by doing that I'm actually

324
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,670
getting the person to open up then as

325
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,580
you're speaking I tell the person oh

326
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,350
that's interesting can you tell me a bit

327
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,600
about your experience with open source

328
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,150
then the person starts man reading to me

329
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,420
a story of women started contributing to

330
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,140
open source

331
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,190
I felt very alienated because I felt

332
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,110
invisible and even though I was

333
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,730
contributing like people didn't cheer me

334
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,160
up enough I just felt that I wasn't

335
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,380
appreciated so if you would share is

336
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,810
alienation the person said that they

337
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,620
felt alienated during the interview so

338
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,080
at that moment you can use a technique

339
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,140
in active listening called sympathy no

340
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,840
called empathy but right now explain to

341
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,970
you what sympathy is and what empathy is

342
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,400
sympathy is saying something like oh

343
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,980
sorry about that empathy is actually

344
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,860
saying like an example like okay this

345
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,589
time of my life I also experienced

346
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,920
alienation and that makes you build a

347
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,480
connection with a person because you are

348
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,640
putting yourself in their shoes so they

349
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,620
feel that ok this person is also putting

350
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,589
themself in a vulnerable state so maybe

351
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,140
they understand me so by doing that by

352
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,670
putting yourself in the shoe of that

353
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,650
person you are exercising empathy and

354
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,390
when at some point of the interview the

355
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,740
person telling me that I feel that

356
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,689
people like that people like me are just

357
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,170
not for open source involvement or take

358
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,640
forcing ourselves into this industries

359
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,040
foot aisle or our ratty Oh in comparison

360
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,470
to that of others proves that when

361
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,920
someone tell you that you somehow feel

362
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,839
like there's a tree girl like you want

363
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,470
to see the person know you are not

364
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,020
invisible in tech we like you but when

365
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,840
we do that you're actually kind of like

366
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,550
indirectly judging the person telling

367
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,470
them what you're saying is not true

368
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,480
we like you it's not like that so at

369
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
that point one of the Schism you have to

370
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,280
use is differ in different a different

371
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,010
judge

372
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,900
and to defer judgment what you do is

373
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,040
actually when someone tells you

374
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,150
something that's a trigger

375
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,309
you don't say how you feel about it

376
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,980
instead you focus on how they feel about

377
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,590
it what made you feel like you are

378
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,390
invisible like what made you feel scared

379
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,130
why do you feel that you don't have a

380
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,020
place in tech when you ask that question

381
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,300
instead you are getting more information

382
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
up from the person instead of saying

383
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,260
like know what you're saying is not true

384
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,300
then the person closed down on you and

385
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,370
won't tell you their actual deep

386
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,520
feelings through them by actually asking

387
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,470
them more questions and defer to your

388
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,080
judgment you extract more information

389
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,150
from the person and then you get more

390
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,130
accurate results in your diversity

391
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,470
research so in the end one thing that

392
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,780
you can always do is summarized somehow

393
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,910
is where the person tell told you and

394
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,250
that helps you get clarification that

395
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,380
you understood what is what they said

396
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,090
because if you say it wrong the person

397
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,580
will collect you but it also helps you

398
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,440
reinforce what you are spoken about

399
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,690
which means that it will help you retain

400
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,010
that information more easily so that's

401
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,679
it about what I had to say as I said

402
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,420
share some key words remember reflect

403
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,990
summarize clarify and empathy and my

404
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,030
call to action to you is to practice

405
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,240
this and let me know your results you

406
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,100
can find a ways to contact me on my

407
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,530
website and feel free to connect with me

408
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,230
on LinkedIn do you have any questions

409
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,710
from me and Christy anyone that has any

410
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,510
question for other they talk with me or

411
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,100
Christy gave you can raise your hands

412
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:36,119
[Applause]

413
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,550
okay I think that a good way to to have

414
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,220
like more women getting involved is like

415
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,610
putting sorry okay

416
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,740
it's like putting a number that you you

417
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,900
for example one to have like fifty fifty

418
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,080
and in the in the process that you are

419
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,690
hiring new people you get more focused

420
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,550
on hiring more women than men or another

421
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,400
thing that you can do is like for not

422
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,700
like taking or being influenced to only

423
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,090
employment you can have like they can

424
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,910
all have the the interview like on the

425
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,380
paper and they and you don't know the

426
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,530
gender of the person that you're taking

427
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,710
the information from so this is also a

428
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,260
way that you will not get influenced by

429
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,300
the by their gender but you are going to

430
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,840
hire them from really from their values

431
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,300
or from their amount of you know

432
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,010
information that they have related to

433
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,620
something because also because there was

434
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,880
done a survey that related to that like

435
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,670
women were better develop women men but

436
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,380
they were not hired because in the

437
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,990
beginning the the person that were going

438
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,310
to hire them knew that they were women

439
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,080
and they learn with a stereotype that

440
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,870
women do not know how to code so it's

441
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,210
not the they were not good like getting

442
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,090
employed so this is also where I

443
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,240
personally suggest that like a politic

444
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,270
that you can use to hire and to have

445
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:39,660
more women yes okay okay so the question

446
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,480
was on the politics for example that we

447
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,020
need to take to have more women in our

448
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,530
work space in our work or in different

449
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,070
fields

450
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:15,830
in case we ask about what about gender

451
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,920
diversity that most people talk about

452
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,360
[Music]

453
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,059
yeah so yeah well I know about that is

454
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,590
that there are some universities

455
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,289
specific that are more tailored to

456
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,340
specific ratio divert racial groups so I

457
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,460
believe that by companies going there in

458
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,740
Korea refers at those schools they can

459
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,259
locate more of those peoples but at the

460
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,080
same time I believe that the way that

461
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,120
they treat the companies with the

462
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,330
employees from those minority racial

463
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,120
groups in their company I can also make

464
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,700
them attract or repel people from that

465
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,379
specific demographic so for those people

466
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:00,379
like for those people that are minority

467
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,539
by race I feel that is very important to

468
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:04,399
make the environment very friendly and

469
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,679
comfortable for them and to make sure

470
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,529
that you create boundaries of what is

471
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,809
allowed between how people deal with

472
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,240
race and difference in the world place

473
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,639
and one way another way I think that

474
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,419
they can fix that issue is to actually

475
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,580
try to reach out to those people because

476
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,929
she's really companies whether he's

477
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:26,240
really do is say we won't know people

478
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,250
from this specific country come to us

479
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,200
did you sit down there and wait for

480
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,909
those people to come to their but that's

481
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,500
not how it works if you want something

482
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,570
you have to go get it so you have to

483
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,789
find where those people usually are

484
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,519
located up and go there and tell them

485
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm from this company I have this offer

486
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,389
you do you have those kids that I'm

487
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,220
looking for and if here's come let's

488
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,700
talk about it that is what I feel

489
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,769
[Music]

490
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,510
I think that it starts from the not from

491
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,360
the it starts from the opportunities

492
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,010
that some people have like for example

493
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,200
someone from a poor family of I can't go

494
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,060
to school like whether the education

495
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,740
there is good and not like education is

496
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,240
not a problem at that poor so he starts

497
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,970
from the economy of the country or that

498
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,370
specific family or that specific racial

499
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,890
group as a whole and then it moves on to

500
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,990
education and therefore medication it

501
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,810
moves on to companies that is how I feel

502
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,990
aside from the economy and then

503
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,810
education and then to companies so any

504
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,850
other questions I think yeah you had a

505
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,090
question

506
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,580
okay I have information for Mozilla

507
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,040
because even Gloria was an outreach

508
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,730
intern in Mozilla back to two years ago

509
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,980
even when the outreach in terms of

510
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,190
Mozilla finish their internship there

511
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,950
they still they're very like inspired to

512
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,770
still contribute and in in Mozilla they

513
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,830
can get like starting to contribute for

514
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,780
example in diversity and inclusion team

515
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,809
that we do have like we do a really big

516
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,780
work on doing some researches on other

517
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,730
things that we really really need to

518
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,470
improve to get our communities annoyed

519
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,080
murderers or they can for example start

520
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,690
contributing in technical areas so the

521
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,030
field is like real wide and they can

522
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,299
find themselves wherever they they they

523
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,760
feel good and there are a lot of like

524
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,530
there are a lot of opportunities even if

525
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,260
the outreach interns do not like fine

526
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,140
for example themselves afterwards in the

527
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,179
in the company for further for the

528
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,280
foundation that they were that they have

529
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,070
been working on they can also start to

530
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,350
search and to see if other opportunities

531
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,770
in other companies because I think that

532
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,510
with that the gain of the experience

533
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,150
that they take it out Richie will

534
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,360
help them a lot like in every kind of

535
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,070
job that they will have like related to

536
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,650
the topic that they have worked on and

537
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,230
doing the researches you're welcome

538
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,130
that in specific I'm not sure if it

539
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,890
exists because it's very specific

540
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,080
usually they do a marginal interview and

541
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,060
then when there's a problem that they

542
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,370
are trying to face Dennis when they go

543
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,700
to more specific types of researches so

544
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,680
if for example in diversity I haven't

545
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,900
really seen people using that skill to

546
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,480
be honest so I don't really think that

547
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,310
anything exists but I can be under

548
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,160
percent sure but even from my own

549
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,450
research when I was trying to find

550
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,030
Studies on it in relation to

551
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,070
interviewing I couldn't find enough data

552
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,660
so I don't know however that yeah you

553
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,640
can research and find something I think

554
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,680
there's one we can give one last one

555
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,940
no it was not for for just the country

556
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,950
it's in general yeah it's in general

557
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:06,760
terms no actually this is interesting

558
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,710
because the numbers are not like first

559
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,929
specific country it's like in general

560
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,690
terms and if for example what I have

561
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,820
spotted out is that is that in developed

562
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,340
countries like in Western Europe the

563
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,380
number of women getting involved in

564
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,530
floss communities is really long and

565
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,270
this happens quite the opposite in the

566
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,790
Balkans for example because the

567
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,650
educational I mentioned that the

568
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,280
educational system is like a little bit

569
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,450
different like we still have that

570
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,410
Russian mentality on learning stuff and

571
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,570
well the westerns come from or like

572
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,270
completely either feel like they give

573
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,540
the space to and two to ten like

574
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,070
whatever school that they want to and

575
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,020
they just like to not focus only getting

576
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,360
a good job and starting putting the

577
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,460
energies on something that will give

578
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,340
like benefits then in the future so for

579
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,049
example if the numbers should have been

580
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,910
as I mentioned for Albania there would

581
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,700
be like completely different because the

582
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,280
number of women are much higher than the

583
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,740
men but it's like it is the opposite for

584
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,679
the Western so this is just like in the

585
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:22,990
general view each one of us will be

586
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,960
around here and ask us thank you very

587
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,290
much

588
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:35,950
[Applause]
