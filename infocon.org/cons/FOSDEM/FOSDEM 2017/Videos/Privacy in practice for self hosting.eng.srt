1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,538
right

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,149
first a welcome for coming at the aware

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:07,750
of lunch

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,850
I'm also suffering and I'm hungry so I

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,650
would try to be fast I only have 20

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,260
minutes I'm here to speak about privacy

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,000
in practice for our self listing and

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,170
when I say the self first thing is not

9
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,539
only for hosting your own stuff it's for

10
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,760
Ossining for other people because when

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,470
you also on social you do not act

12
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,530
privacy of your own data I would like to

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,060
ask to people to not take too much

14
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,168
picture of me if we see board zero let's

15
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,760
talk about privacy so I expect people to

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,670
respect that quickly about me I'm a

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,800
system administrator working at reddit

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,929
in the open source and Stoddart team we

19
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,899
help a between project with the various

20
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,760
things such as community management

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,309
event management design and in my case

22
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,499
cleaning everything the developer did on

23
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,210
the infrastructure when everything is

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,389
broken which is a topic quite

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,069
interesting so I do a lot of security

26
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,699
stuff I try to care and so about privacy

27
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,339
for community I have a very strong

28
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:05,970
opinion as my your coworker can attest

29
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,759
so yeah what is privacy for me privacy

30
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,520
it's linked as I say to security which

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,920
is linked to CIF not the bad guy in the

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,570
James Bond movie but our confidentiality

33
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,780
integrity and availability especially

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,689
the part about confidentiality where I

35
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:25,960
want you data to be kept secret and for

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,689
example not been used by bad actor and

37
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,840
which is something that usually happen

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,359
when you start to trust Google Amazon

39
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,820
Facebook and etcetera etcetera as I

40
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,700
assume that there is maybe some people

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,799
who were not here since the beginning of

42
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,109
the track and are just listening because

43
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm ear I want to remind quickly why the

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,289
Deaf are bad for privacy

45
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,880
so first it's a question of

46
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,939
contradictory incentive on one end I

47
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,770
know people there and I know they want

48
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,140
to protect privacy on the other hand the

49
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,759
world business model is getting private

50
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,310
data and reselling them so you cannot

51
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,049
really get something completely private

52
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:09,068
when you need that to get money and to

53
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,950
live like getting word getting food and

54
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,020
everything it's quite important for them

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,810
as it is for me

56
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,850
sometimes they fight back against

57
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,100
parliament and write sometimes I do not

58
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,000
and the main and I think the biggest

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,310
issues we want that we tend to forget

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,709
it's the lack of diversity in technology

61
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,540
when you have someone in sao francisco

62
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,060
it's easy to say yeah i want to share on

63
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,580
my picture on whatever Google decided to

64
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,739
do because nothing bad would happen to

65
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,739
me well when you are someone in some

66
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,720
ways to achieve country and more ways to

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,090
achieve than a current USA I would not

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,000
make joke about it right not now well

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,410
maybe you have a different point of view

70
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,209
but you are not working at Google and

71
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,860
maybe Google is not asking you anything

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,630
because you're just a user

73
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,790
well maybe they would not take care of

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,600
anything you want and this were self

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,209
wasting is quite important because it

76
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,459
goes privacy beyond GLA so it's not

77
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,970
Kaylee's or control system

78
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,739
it's a three-letter agency like NSA FSB

79
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,959
DGSE which is for later but uses or

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,769
which is a point and in order to do that

81
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,360
you need to think about the first model

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,269
which is basically try to decide where

83
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,820
is what people wants to do like bad guy

84
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,880
from generic bad so most of the time

85
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,350
people say yeah there is a state level

86
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,810
adversary and there is NSA and China

87
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,640
anyway thing wants to get to me well

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,079
most of the time no unless you are a

89
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,750
tourist and if you are please do not ask

90
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,579
question about I'm a tourist what can I

91
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,910
do during the question for the recorded

92
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,950
at worst what you can get is the cops

93
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,510
are a lot of people doing activism and

94
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,100
sometimes cops just knock on your door

95
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,570
saying oh you want you to organize a

96
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,060
protest against that whatever so share

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,709
stuff everyone master stuff and

98
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,720
everything like we have to ask you some

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,880
question sometimes they go to the wrong

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,290
person sometimes they go through the

101
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,890
right and everything and sometimes while

102
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,329
you are just attacked by your coworker

103
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,700
that guys that you decided to kill at

104
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,150
Turk wake your ex lover with the abusive

105
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,190
guy maybe your neighbor because you said

106
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,810
that his dog is really loud and you call

107
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,380
the Cohanim

108
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,329
or your family because you are obviously

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,039
user and they are all different

110
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,040
they do not need to know so yeah when

111
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,540
you think about it previously can be

112
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,990
anything one of the most common example

113
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,600
is IP address you could say it's bad but

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
they never explain why it's bad so from

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,580
the wall let's say that you are on IRC

116
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,900
you connect so that's me

117
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,810
connecting on from some provider I

118
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,640
joined the film channel and then the

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,620
with someone else Arirang which may be a

120
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,540
year or not year we were speaking one

121
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,610
hour ago and you connect from the same

122
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,300
ip address so based on that you think M

123
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,510
maybe they are at the same place and

124
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,650
depending on the circumstance maybe they

125
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,420
are at the same workplace which is fine

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,820
if we are working together but maybe we

127
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,340
are not working together and why am I in

128
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,770
the office of arena maybe we are at the

129
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,320
same home while maybe we were connecting

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,940
during the night and that's where I

131
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,010
start to say why I am sleeping at our

132
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,110
warehouse and maybe if is what's called

133
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,080
Adriana maybe things will be different

134
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,240
so that's the kind of stuff when we say

135
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,850
privacy problem that can be in a sound

136
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,650
like I'm connected from my phone that

137
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,210
with one medium person with the same ip

138
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,669
address ok no problem I'm connected from

139
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,470
a specific IP maybe there is something

140
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,110
and if you got say yeah you can ash IP

141
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,790
no I do not add for example people

142
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,080
disconnect at the same time because

143
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,660
network is crappy well don't have that

144
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,940
you found something

145
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,010
so right back to the basics I will focus

146
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,080
on the web because everything is web and

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,660
it's easy oh I have 20 minutes

148
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,410
so first jealous I mean everybody can

149
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,270
use that song script you have to use it

150
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,250
there is no reason to not use it at

151
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,460
least no good reason so you need to use

152
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,800
good cipher but it's only if you want to

153
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,050
protect from a state level adversary and

154
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,400
everything so it's everything you need

155
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,260
on Madeira wiki you can use a search

156
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,160
engine for that

157
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,680
I also recommend to take a look at the

158
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,840
crypto policy project it's a project

159
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,660
aiming at making one single

160
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,040
configuration for reward system for

161
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,100
cryptography like strong future a normal

162
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,560
week which is much better than what we

163
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,540
have now which is a 20 different or

164
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,150
syntax for setting every single cipher

165
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,850
and the order for every project which is

166
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,060
bad we can take a look at

167
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,880
okay IP etc etc so there is that of get

168
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,760
out there I'm not gonna repeat them but

169
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,800
what you need to do is to discuss with

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,310
your author with your user because some

171
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,380
of them have older browser right

172
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,910
sometimes I do not have choice

173
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,669
everybody can remember the old windows

174
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,030
from the school and this kind of stuff

175
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,610
it depends really on what they want to

176
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,160
avoid so if you want to protect people

177
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,940
you need to get some set of cipher and

178
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,070
sometimes you block access for other so

179
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,260
what I will recommend is to provide two

180
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,139
videos one for insecure stuff one for

181
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,280
secure stuff and you can then

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,229
communicate with user without trying to

183
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,970
track them I mean at the world point of

184
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,139
privacy Eastern not track people set up

185
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,150
by Network great Bob this kind of stuff

186
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,790
because remember biggest which is not

187
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,010
always Jedi sometime it just someone at

188
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,930
your school sometime it's someone living

189
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,870
with you and everything another option

190
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,720
is to offer onion services people who do

191
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,930
not know what this it's onion when it's

192
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,120
on top of tower you do everything with

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,700
store I will not explain what the story

194
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,800
I hope that someone can do it for me

195
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
data again 20 minutes exit exit from it

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,710
can add to avoid the IP leak it require

197
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,800
a specific setup currently it's quite

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,950
hard to scale properly it's research

199
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,370
topic so there is a lot of specific

200
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,050
attack where people try to steal your

201
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,270
key and everything so if you want to be

202
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,950
sorry for that you need monitoring and

203
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,620
spend a lot of time to research what is

204
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,750
going on I'm pretty sure that in a few

205
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,940
year it will be easier but for now it's

206
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,490
not exactly a but that's a great idea

207
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,650
because then you can make a talk about

208
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,370
it for next year another issue is the

209
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,200
use of external javascript

210
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,970
again it's a web you know that want to

211
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,100
start to Oh store 1 million version of

212
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,469
jQuery but it turned out that it's an IP

213
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,860
leak so if you can avoid while avoid it

214
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,679
now we go to the biggest issue which is

215
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,190
the logs that's an issue because well

216
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,350
lock the critical if you get attacked

217
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,600
but the problem is pressing an attacker

218
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,150
it's the same data user I'm not saying

219
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,800
that you are attacker at least

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,790
not on record but it kind of the same

221
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,369
for that server solution first one easy

222
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,399
no drugs no drugs no program it might be

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,019
the girl I'm not a lawyer do what you

224
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,999
want sometimes I find might be okay

225
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,369
because it's not so expensive when

226
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,959
compared getting someone to jail

227
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,660
sometimes it's your money so you decide

228
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,079
what you want some people try to

229
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,670
anonymize the log which is usually

230
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,499
working fine that reduces the risk of

231
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:21,009
the risk of leaks but yeah when you have

232
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,779
something like this in the log you can

233
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,759
anonymize the IP address as you want you

234
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,649
will see that there is still my name and

235
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,029
so yeah you need to reduce information

236
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,489
logged as soon as possible for Amber do

237
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,709
you need a user agent maybe maybe not do

238
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,799
you need the APS referral one

239
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,569
interesting trick is to use an ID for

240
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,389
each user and you keep the mapping of ID

241
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,699
out of the log so everything will be

242
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:48,819
user number of something and someone

243
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:50,920
asked for the rug well none of that if

244
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,269
they do not have that mapping because

245
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:53,860
it's not on the log you cannot do much

246
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,980
to that protect against accidental dick

247
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,249
for example cut and paste on bug tracker

248
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,449
ought to make it cut and passed on back

249
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,399
tracker description on IRC and

250
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,129
everything it mind or my not first red

251
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,170
chilli which might or might not be a

252
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,639
good idea again depends it's also nice

253
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,949
because it is user name change sometimes

254
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,529
you do not want to keep a nice guy from

255
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,129
some department and get moster mr. nice

256
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,049
guy or if you change name because you

257
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,019
are married this kind of stuff

258
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,970
obviously you need a CL for the log if

259
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,740
possible separation of access which

260
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,850
means that you need to have more than

261
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,149
one admin which can be our if you want

262
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,279
to avoid abuse there is a three-step I

263
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,209
did hide it and put it if possible no

264
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,549
direct access to log now you can use

265
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:44,019
something like elastic search but I

266
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,339
cannot free commands the tool because

267
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:47,439
it's quite hard to install and it's not

268
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,959
exactly good from a security point of

269
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,839
view but something like this but not

270
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,959
this

271
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,850
if you can get a public trail of who

272
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,709
with the log that's usually prevent

273
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,480
people from abusing that if you know

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,800
that or if you are looking at the same

275
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,139
person every day maybe people would not

276
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,930
do it so is the issue for a long-term

277
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,389
storage as well you decide that we do

278
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,209
not do that because ok or you decide to

279
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,540
use aggregate log in the end you need to

280
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,100
decide why you need logs in the first

281
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,649
place maybe if you have set for one week

282
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,120
it should be sufficient maybe you need

283
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,810
one year because this is zero maybe so

284
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,250
you need to think about what you want

285
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,519
and what you need another issue to keep

286
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,649
in mind it's big backup so obviously it

287
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,490
needs to be encrypted

288
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,290
I say obviously but people do not do

289
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,050
that you need to test them I mean people

290
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,180
have seen what happened to get lab and

291
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,990
it remind one interesting question is

292
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,760
what to do is back up when a user leave

293
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,209
and that's quite complicated because

294
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,430
sometimes user early but it's not the

295
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,529
user someone get access to the password

296
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,610
or decide to dig to destroy so account

297
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,160
what do you do if you do not keep backup

298
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,839
it's fine when people want to disappear

299
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,820
if you keep backup well if someone makes

300
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,350
someone else disappear you can save the

301
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,260
day usually what people do is to stop

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,870
cleaning like you say okay we clean the

303
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,490
back up in two weeks in case you change

304
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,180
your mind

305
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,769
but the third so the kind of trick that

306
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,100
Facebook is using so that's not great

307
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,899
yeah whatever you do we can award weapon

308
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,649
there is no perfect choice something

309
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,360
also that I try to recommend is to use

310
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,430
open infrastructure so you publish the

311
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,220
configuration that make adder to do

312
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,079
something fishy like the sidings I don't

313
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,600
need to collect more information you

314
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,910
cannot do that without being seen in

315
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,069
practice not much people will win but at

316
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:41,220
least it's better it will first with

317
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,860
user it allow people to for can listen

318
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,600
for eyes this is decentralized internet

319
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,209
whom so it's good we're showing more

320
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,220
information there is a website that just

321
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,040
started two weeks ago and if people have

322
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,470
lots of money you can go to scale in

323
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,310
South Korea South California there is a

324
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,050
world dedicated to that another one

325
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,220
interesting thing to take in account

326
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,829
it's centralized authentication so for

327
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,400
me

328
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
is great I mean it's easier to attend a

329
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,540
baby that's why is the catchy smiling it

330
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,410
no need to have two-factor

331
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,380
authentication or more easily but at the

332
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,940
same time it's easier to trace people

333
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,130
because the same people will connect on

334
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,440
once on file system and it will have the

335
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,630
same name everywhere and most of the

336
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,580
time it require upstream work so I know

337
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,230
that for example for myself which is a

338
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,620
group writing services do not want to

339
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,180
set up some college education for

340
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,880
political reason so again no perfect no

341
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,760
perfect solution so you need to be

342
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,620
proactive look for a way to attack

343
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,330
privacy which basically mean be a

344
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,260
stalker let's be clear you need to think

345
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,750
about sharing policy I would recommend

346
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,560
to see which is what Mozilla is doing so

347
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,570
they have six principal the first one is

348
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,880
no surprise surprise as well but only

349
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,280
for Christmas as birthday you need to

350
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,740
tell people what you do that means that

351
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,150
you mean need to make sure that they

352
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,070
understand basically do not get a lawyer

353
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,110
to write a document to explain that you

354
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,870
really do not work so it needs to be

355
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,240
tested with user discuss with user make

356
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,860
sure that they understand something and

357
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,660
not something else you need to make sure

358
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,360
that you give them with choice again as

359
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,920
I needs to be clear you need to discuss

360
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,730
with user user

361
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,160
everything you need to have sensitive

362
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,680
sense your default if you create a

363
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,260
system for blog a blog is supposed to be

364
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,270
public if you create the same system for

365
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,370
a private URL it should go to be private

366
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,890
it's technologically the same stuff you

367
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,410
write stuff and it's recorded but the

368
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,560
default will be different of course you

369
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,500
need to limit the data data that you do

370
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,120
not ever data that are cannot be leaked

371
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,820
that can only be private and you need to

372
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,040
make sure that the users stay in control

373
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,150
and that you trust sir party make sure

374
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,690
that sir party are taking privacy

375
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,450
seriously and everything which is quite

376
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,520
out to do everything but it's up to you

377
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,900
to decide Tanya and there is the world

378
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,780
importance of two weeks which is by

379
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,170
itself a world topic that will span one

380
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,420
hour description so in C that we just

381
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,270
remind discuss with user and discuss

382
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,830
with more than your friend because if

383
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,670
you are in this room you are likely to

384
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,620
more power on wheels and regular user

385
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,220
and you may well you may not see that

386
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,020
yeah maybe gbg is great because you can

387
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,860
select whatever you want okay wait what

388
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,070
Kyle size of key you want anything

389
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,410
but most people will not want to do that

390
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,990
they want a checkbox private and that's

391
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,450
it so you need to discuss with with user

392
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,240
or more mainstream one because your

393
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,800
friend must have the time I will I mean

394
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,540
it's fine if they are not I'm not

395
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,470
judging anyone but yeah so what to do to

396
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,450
avoid see son Minister King and witness

397
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,280
that's your skies attack because that

398
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,580
someone will come for everything with

399
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,530
some time can be as we sure and that

400
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,200
very time season mean that's called the

401
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,880
confused deputy problem with that of

402
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,630
description about that again I keep

403
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,820
waiting repeating myself because when I

404
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,010
was in university we are saying that

405
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,880
repetition is everything so audit what

406
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,470
is going on so you can see if there is

407
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,420
something you can go back that's what

408
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,010
she said means this I mean if they are

409
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,110
volunteers I need to be aware that they

410
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,030
will be spied on by other OSes admin and

411
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,850
everything the world watch the rest of

412
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,010
stuff I cannot speak that you know or I

413
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,500
would have said in that in again provide

414
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,300
direct access if you can use coughing

415
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,340
management do it if you cannot go to

416
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,110
coffee management come tomorrow in Gant

417
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,880
learn how to do it and go back to that

418
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,670
slide if you want to be 20s or is the

419
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,650
world's our last continent stuff because

420
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,630
if there is no server to connect there

421
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,270
is no problem and if there is

422
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,680
configurations that cannot be changed

423
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,510
because container everything well it

424
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,940
cannot be changing there is less risk of

425
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,640
abuse if you have more time you can take

426
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,740
a look at various research topic such as

427
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,510
peer and everything where people do not

428
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,130
give you data they give you encrypted

429
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,680
data and you can make computation or on

430
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,349
it something like zero past the open I

431
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,960
think is working like this the server

432
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,930
has no knowledge or anything everything

433
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,780
is done client-side but for more than

434
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,760
app has been because that's quite

435
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,180
limiting and to conclude think about

436
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,520
week's discuss with user I said that's

437
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,140
where time so just make sure you

438
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,290
understand that communicate if you can

439
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,850
patch security extremes that great so I

440
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,020
do not have to do that

441
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,320
and that I'm not corrected is that that

442
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,660
cannot be leaked it's quite easy you can

443
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,090
print it in your office think about it

444
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,400
if you want to connect to contact me

445
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,830
well you can use whatever you want as

446
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,309
long as it's IRC or mail thank you and

447
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,410
if you have a question it's the right

448
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,880
time we have seven minutes if I'm not

449
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:12,850
wrong if you do not have any question

450
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,410
I'm okay with people clapping for five

451
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,590
minutes

452
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,690
so the question is is it worthwhile to

453
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,679
encrypt a disk and in a server if you do

454
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,350
not look anything and if the data are

455
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,520
are we doing 15 it depends because you

456
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
can still have someone going to the data

457
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,540
center taking the disk pretending like

458
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,390
there is power cut changing the data and

459
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,309
then putting it back

460
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,530
that's unlikely to happen but that's

461
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,450
something that can happen and the other

462
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,400
problem is even if you need to encrypt

463
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,710
the data sometime you just take out of

464
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,260
the box for software such as might not

465
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,540
know web mail and most of them do not

466
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,630
have encryption right now you can add it

467
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,970
but it require to be able to code that

468
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,590
we help students we accept and

469
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,300
everything so if you want to get

470
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,200
something fast maybe not and no matter

471
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,580
what you do is always so that you cannot

472
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,480
run fit for example you want to make

473
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,860
sure that people do not know you can

474
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,720
access with the server there is SSH key

475
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,450
you cannot encrypt them I mean they need

476
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,070
to be in clear text when the service is

477
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,460
started on this kind of stuff so I'm

478
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,970
so it cannot add too much to encrypt the

479
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,130
data then of course it become

480
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,390
complicated because you need to have a

481
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,040
specific in etiology you need to have

482
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,580
some specific process I know that people

483
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,620
that wear that are working on that you

484
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,420
can take a look at an Italian macaroon

485
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,360
walk is likely giving a talk somewhere

486
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,100
at first them about it so what you were

487
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,800
recording but for now the people are

488
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,110
people who are doing that are just using

489
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,450
out of the box in etiology stuff which

490
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,220
would be where someone connect and

491
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,610
decrypt that's for fine you have more

492
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,860
down time so you have to decide if it's

493
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,410
okay or not again there is no perfect

494
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,360
solution you just need to decide is it

495
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,700
false word is isn't it works file you

496
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,770
can try and then change back because

497
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,600
that servers are supposed to be through

498
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,060
a row board and again coffee management

499
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,440
reinstall everything it strikes it well

500
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,260
so it depends now when has any question

501
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,450
I cannot transfer but confuse people

502
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:54,180
like this yep

503
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,200
so the question is if I do self-esteem

504
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,940
in my house I cannot prove to people

505
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,920
that I'm not doing anything with the

506
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,590
server I think you cannot prove it

507
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,160
because even if it's data center if you

508
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,110
pay for it you can likely access it I

509
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,770
can say yeah I'm hosting something on a

510
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,170
data center from OVH which is a famous

511
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,600
European provider and if I pay enough

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,160
like if I do not take the cheapest

513
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,380
possible way but I can get access to the

514
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,750
work and do whatever I want and even if

515
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,190
I do not have access at the hardware

516
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,130
level while I'm root I can refresh abuse

517
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,870
I can do whatever I want

518
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,530
so yeah that's quite hard you cannot

519
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,690
really prove that the with people

520
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,850
working on it with a remote attestation

521
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,100
and making sure that you execute the

522
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,600
code and the code is not modified with

523
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,730
TPM any roofing I think that's still a

524
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,750
topic of open research but in the end if

525
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,100
you want to delegate something to

526
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,110
someone you can I have to trust that

527
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,690
person to not up the system because

528
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,700
they can just refuse to do something and

529
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,010
that will mean a lack of availability

530
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,220
which can be a problem for someone so as

531
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,720
long as you delegate and people can

532
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
decide to not do anything that's an

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,300
issue so you have to trust someone but

534
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,370
yes that's a complicated topic and I do

535
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,120
not have good answer

536
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,730
so maybe one more question because of 1

537
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:32,070
minutes 2 minutes 1 minute yep so I tend

538
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,159
to prefer some oh yeah what is my

539
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,129
preferred hardware start to use well it

540
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,499
depends on how much people I need to ask

541
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:43,019
for work while we are basically getting

542
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,149
expensive server because we want to get

543
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:47,639
lots of memory to run Jenkins great and

544
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,980
everything at my home when it's me

545
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,570
paying out of my pocket with my

546
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,070
electricity and everything I just get

547
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,429
cheap possible board either was verified

548
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:57,809
because people are throwing them away

549
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,600
and it cannot be cheaper than free or

550
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,279
getting bigger bone because it's well

551
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,149
supported by federal 25 and I can add a

552
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:08,100
TPM for crypto acceleration and this

553
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,490
kind of stuff I do run a tor node in my

554
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,210
house because the fiberline do not feel

555
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,330
by itself by just by me so I can use it

556
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,450
and it's running fine there is nothing

557
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,809
for remote access except serial port and

558
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,850
I have the full control it's cheap

559
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,889
enough to not have any internal stuff

560
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:31,320
and it works well except when it's

561
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,240
broken in upstream kernel but let's not

562
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,090
discuss about that and you can get a TPM

563
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,580
and the crypto cap so you can do all

564
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,529
kind of security stuff which I do not do

565
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,690
because I do not have time but yeah and

566
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,690
it consume almost nothing and it's

567
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,200
powerful enough to run a tor node which

568
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,610
is doing a lot of CPU so it should be

569
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,429
fine for I don't know mail spam

570
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,440
filtering and everything any chip

571
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:10,609
