1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,470
okay so who has a ham radio license

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,809
looked quite a few hams here okay so

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,259
there's no big surprises in this talk

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,150
for you but that I hope you'll find

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,580
something interesting it who is studying

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,570
for a ham radio license at the moment

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,410
okay and who's thought about starting to

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,779
apply for a ham radio license who would

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,630
like to ok very good

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,010
and so ham radio is a scientific hobby

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,910
and it's non-commercial license is

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,090
required to transmit and anybody can

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,120
receive without a license and ham radio

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,520
has a lot of things in common with free

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,760
software development learning in

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,800
education and experimentation innovation

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,140
volunteering and by the way FOSDEM are

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,059
still looking for volunteers if anybody

19
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,780
is interested technical excellence their

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,770
science and communications of course ham

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,229
radio plays a big role in emergency

22
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,659
communications in many parts of the

23
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,020
world when something goes wrong radio

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,490
amateurs are the first on the scene

25
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,890
hardware skills are optional and we

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,299
don't need to know everything about

27
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,840
electronics or constructing circuit

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
boards or antennas to to be successful

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,619
in ham radio many people are interested

30
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,140
in digital modes and things like

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,000
software-defined radio which is the

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
purpose of this room today and you do

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,770
need to know about the theory in order

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,759
to pass the exam most hams only have a

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,479
subset of skills and some people are

36
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,180
very very strong with digital modes or

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,239
software others have very good skills

38
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,920
and and workshops for building antennas

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,780
so people often come together through

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,330
clubs and through their local community

41
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,090
to to put these skills together and

42
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,720
build complete solutions and there are

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,240
also national associations which join

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,450
together many of the clubs it's not a

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,790
free-for-all I mean into the free

46
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,030
software world we often talk about the

47
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,030
freedoms that you have with software in

48
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,150
amateur radio there's no religion no

49
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,360
politics and no entertainment otherwise

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,970
you can use it for social communications

51
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,670
so to speak to your friends and family

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,410
if they have licenses you can use it for

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,030
experimentation but you can't use it for

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,220
other types of broadcasting so it's not

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,680
as free as the freedom in in free

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,670
software this is an overview of the

57
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,750
radio spectrum one of these little

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,220
dongles which I'm going to demonstrate

59
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,880
shortly will pick up everything from

60
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,519
about about 24 megahertz somewhere about

61
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,440
here all the way up to maybe 1.7

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,579
gigahertz with an OP converter which you

63
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:43,340
can add to the dongle and like this you

64
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,410
can like you can start getting signals

65
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,570
from down here as well so

66
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,920
so propagation is a big topic in amateur

67
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,340
radio and at those lower ends of the

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,640
spectrum the longer wavelengths you can

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,459
make contacts all around the world with

70
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,590
signals that are reflected through the

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,810
atmosphere at various times of the day

72
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,358
or night on the higher frequency so VHF

73
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,330
and uhf you can make local contacts

74
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,600
often with a higher quality using an FM

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,039
mode but you won't get the same distance

76
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,949
you won't get signals reflecting through

77
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,539
the atmosphere and going all the way to

78
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,570
Australia and on the other hand you can

79
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,639
bounce those signals off the moon and

80
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,110
they'll come back if you have enough

81
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,030
power and there are many different modes

82
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:53,020
and yeah yeah yeah it's okay there yeah

83
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,490
there are many different modes CW or

84
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,250
Morse code is the most basic you've got

85
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,650
single sideband and frequency modulation

86
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,889
packet data which is a digital mode and

87
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,090
television and you can do all of these

88
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,919
types of transmission with amateur radio

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,740
yeah the dongle here only costs about

90
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,680
twenty dollars and the quality of the

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,169
signals you receive will depend to a

92
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,050
large extent on the antenna that you use

93
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,389
with a little antenna like this which

94
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,789
will cost you at five dollars you can do

95
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,830
a very good job of picking up a lot of

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,320
signals in your local area so for a few

97
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,199
hundred meters around where you live if

98
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,729
you create a more elaborate

99
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,039
an antenna like this this is a 20 meter

100
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,779
loop antenna that I've constructed

101
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,689
myself using bits I purchased off the

102
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,979
internet and and if you use the right

103
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:06,689
cables and connectors and you attach

104
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,740
this to the the up converter and then

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,379
into the dongle and you can receive

106
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:22,969
signals from all around the world and so

107
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,449
I'll just pull this out so we can pass

108
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:38,669
it around the room the way this was

109
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,499
constructed and my purchased a 25 meter

110
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:48,990
roll of enamel copper wire and which

111
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,499
costs you know less than 10 euro and I

112
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,860
purchased a box of these little

113
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,099
insulators and off eBay and once again

114
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,469
you can get boxes of them for less than

115
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:09,419
10 euro this is a ballon it connects

116
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,419
from the enamel copper wire to the

117
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,800
coaxial cable like this and that costs

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,729
the costs of those very this one is

119
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,889
rated to transmit up to 300 watts and

120
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:27,029
something that can transmit more power

121
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,770
might cost more money

122
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,449
there are also some cheaper ones that

123
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,899
are not suitable for transmitting and

124
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:39,539
with that one was about 30 euro I get

125
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,759
the measurements off a web site and just

126
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,949
cut the wire to the right length and

127
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,999
strip off these little bits on the end

128
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:57,289
of the wire put them into the the

129
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:10,370
terminal blocks on the Ballon so it's

130
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,039
tied on here for strength and support

131
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,379
and then it's connected into the little

132
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,139
terminal here for electrical contact

133
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,190
and now would anyone like to help me

134
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,170
pass this around the room just joined

135
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,420
unroll it somehow it won't be yeah it's

136
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,290
a loop yeah so just gently just hold

137
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,320
that together and then if you take you

138
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,330
sit and just take it around the room

139
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,570
yeah you can keep that end here yeah

140
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,850
we'll just show how big it is so if you

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,000
maybe yeah just start to try and unroll

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,240
it

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,820
I spend a few minutes on this just to

144
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,490
emphasize that that a lot of effort goes

145
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,210
into making the antennas because this is

146
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,730
a big part of success in amateur radio

147
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,500
and with a large antenna like this and

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,600
even with a couple of small bits and

149
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,370
pieces like this there are purchased off

150
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,560
the internet I really can receive

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,470
signals from all around the world but I

152
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,540
wouldn't normally operate the antenna in

153
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,700
the room I'd have it outside somewhere

154
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,430
or possibly in a rooftop or on a balcony

155
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,720
the transmission line that you use also

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,910
makes a big difference to the success of

157
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,700
your radio system this is a very thin 50

158
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,790
ohm coax most radio most amateur radio

159
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,480
systems use 50 ohm so not the 75 ohm

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,870
coaxial use for TV and with this one's

161
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,240
quite thin we'd use a larger thicker

162
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,900
coax for this type of HF reception

163
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,900
especially if we had to run the cable 20

164
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,180
or 30 meters you can see some of that

165
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,640
outside where the local amateur radio

166
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,040
club have set up a booth and they've got

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,190
a mast outside the building did anyone

168
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,380
see the mast when they were coming over

169
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,200
here yeah okay these little connectors

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,480
they also make a big difference to your

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,970
success so if you buy really cheap ones

172
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,300
of eBay and I just suggest you test them

173
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,680
thoroughly because you may they may be

174
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,020
holding you back if they're not working

175
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,410
how would you know and you'd need some

176
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,200
test equipment or if you if you actually

177
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,820
have positive results then you might

178
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,370
have a good sign that it's working if

179
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,960
you're transmitting and you use

180
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,630
something like the SWR meter that might

181
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,120
also give you clues that your connectors

182
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,730
are not working well but you don't know

183
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,770
if it's the connector or the cable or

184
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,220
the antenna so and this is a block

185
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,190
diagram of a radio system so a real

186
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,960
radio not a SDR and this has a number of

187
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:39,280
oscillators mixers finally a FM d

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,190
modulator and eventually we get an audio

189
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,530
signal so that's just for receiving a

190
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,500
transmitter block diagram looks similar

191
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,060
but in Reverse an SDR is a lot simpler

192
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,760
you've got a filter and some

193
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,700
amplification an oscillator and a mixer

194
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
and then an analog digital converter and

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,370
everything else from that other

196
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,200
diagram is then done here in the

197
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:16,580
software so these are the rtl-sdr

198
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,630
dongles who has one of these already

199
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,310
okay everyone in the room who doesn't

200
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,790
have one

201
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,250
anybody yeah so they're very easy to get

202
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,820
and if you're purchasing one of these

203
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,760
you'll find the most generic ones for TV

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,540
reception a less than 10 euro and but

205
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,220
they don't have the stability to get

206
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,830
narrowband signals from you know

207
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,890
transmitters like this so that's why we

208
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,380
buy the slightly more expensive ones

209
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,050
which are about 20 euro which are made

210
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,650
for the purpose of SDR not just for TV

211
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,740
reception they basically have a

212
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,320
different crystal oscillator in them

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,300
with more stability they have a better

214
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,360
case and they have the SMA connector

215
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,880
which allows you to connect you know to

216
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
most of the antennas and other things

217
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,589
you'll be interested in and so a little

218
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,650
bit about Debian is one of the things

219
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,610
that brings me here today is is Debian

220
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,440
in Debian you know we have a whole

221
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,920
operating system we have over 20,000

222
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
packages everything is free software so

223
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,800
we guarantee that we give you the source

224
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,980
code for everything in Debian we have a

225
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,790
big process for producing Debian and

226
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,680
very ensuring the quality of a stable

227
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,810
release of the Debian operating system

228
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,650
and within the Debian community like in

229
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,620
every community in in that you'll

230
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,200
encounter in the free software you'll

231
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,570
find a few radio amateurs and we've got

232
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,730
about a thousand Debian developers so

233
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,400
we've got quite a few radio amateurs in

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,680
there and we've grouped together to

235
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,630
produce packages of stuff that's

236
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,610
interesting for other radio amateurs

237
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,000
that's the Debian hams team in Debian

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,730
and and what we have is a blend of

239
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,010
Debian which means you you can actually

240
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,170
build a Debian CD that comes

241
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,120
pre-installed with all the stuff you'll

242
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,550
be interested in ready to run in the

243
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,420
shack and you can run it from a CD or

244
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,959
DVD you can put it onto a USB stick put

245
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,910
it into an old computer in the shack and

246
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,310
get up and running right away

247
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,940
now who who uses Debian already yeah and

248
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,190
who uses a derivative of Debian like a

249
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,800
Bunter and okay

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,610
so it's well known that Debian freezes

251
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,370
every two years and then everything sits

252
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,440
there at the same version for two years

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,010
and in a fast-moving area like SDR you

254
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,260
may not be satisfied with that you may

255
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,399
want cutting-edge releases of things and

256
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,230
we have a way of doing this in Debian

257
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,870
called the back port system so we

258
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,269
actually build back ports of the

259
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:15,600
cutting-edge releases of things on a

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,779
stable system and then we release that

261
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,360
into the back ports catalog so you can

262
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,420
very conveniently install those packages

263
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,510
with the same apt-get utility that you

264
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,399
use to install any of the stable

265
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,370
packages and so you can see an example

266
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,140
here from gqr x which is an SDR

267
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,910
application the stable release of Debian

268
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,720
has version 2.3 point 1 the latest

269
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,380
version is 2.6 and the back port which

270
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,370
is a BPO here is also 2.6 so somebody

271
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,810
who installed the last stable release in

272
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,329
2014 can get this immediately without

273
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,480
any compiling so this makes the back

274
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,620
ports very relevant for the fast-moving

275
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,709
fields like SDR them so going on to the

276
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,310
demo

277
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,110
how are we going with the antenna where

278
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,870
where did the antenna end up down here

279
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,040
okay

280
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:30,530
any questions about the antenna okay so

281
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,390
do you have a microphone for questions

282
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:54,070
okay this antenna so he's asked me about

283
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,470
transmitting with high power this

284
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,750
antenna would not be used for a high

285
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,300
power transmission this other antenna

286
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,240
and can handle high power RF it has the

287
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,209
insulators so that you don't handle it

288
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,089
with your fingers and or attach it to

289
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,030
your furniture or something that you

290
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,750
might damage so and if you put it up

291
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,520
high then you're unlikely to kill your

292
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:30,620
cat and thank you but yeah this you

293
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,160
actually have to check the the thickness

294
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,130
of the wire that you use for building an

295
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,080
antenna like this like this one you can

296
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,660
see it's actually not that flexible and

297
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,290
it's not a really thin wire like if you

298
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,780
opened up a wire from your speakers and

299
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,940
pull the bits of copper apart they're a

300
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,680
lot thinner than this this is actually

301
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,410
quite thick and can handle a few hundred

302
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:07,820
watts of power come back to you after

303
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,379
the demo yep okay

304
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:43,670
[Applause]
