1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,979
okay so hi and welcome to my talk it's

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,860
about a small side project that I worked

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,170
on but I had a lot of fun doing it and I

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,570
think it's a very simple application of

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,710
new radio and SDR in general and it's

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,300
something very accessible I did it with

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
hardware for 35 euros so maybe it gives

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,640
you an idea of what you can look at and

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
what's out there where you can kind of

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,820
start playing with software-defined

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,239
radio so a bit about me I'm Bastien and

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm work a lot with software-defined

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,500
radio a bit at university where i mainly

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,370
work on Wi-Fi stuff but also on sensor

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,990
networking stuff when we have a project

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,490
where we actually bought sensor modes on

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:44,880
bats

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,550
so that was fun and in my free time I

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,950
play around with different technologies

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,860
a bit with RDS and try to receive what's

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,790
out there okay so these days a lot of

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,920
people actually talking about smart

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,850
cities smart power grids smart lights

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,129
smart everything and smart often means

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,740
networked embedded systems network often

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,159
means Wireless and yeah but actually

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,050
today I thought let's do the absolute

28
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,170
opposite and let's look at the absolute

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,180
dumbest thing you could ever do and in

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,790
fact when we in university have the

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,590
curse on embedded system the kind of

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,750
hello world application is always let's

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,150
turn an LED on and off and basically

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,420
that's what I want to look at today so

35
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,290
let's friend some LEDs on and off so in

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,659
Germany we we have some wireless traffic

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,850
lights and some there was a person

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,770
hackaday about what I am just showing

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,010
and then I read the comment when I was a

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,690
discussion like what the hell is she

41
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,409
talking about

42
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,960
and then somebody explained that they

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,369
seemingly have these wireless traffic

44
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,990
lights in Europe so I don't know if they

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,299
just are not there in the US or whatever

46
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,820
but yeah so it's about mobile traffic

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,159
lights and I just wanted to give a very

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,229
brief shout out to my friends from India

49
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,229
because they just by chance found these

50
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,030
same traffic lights in the GSM network

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,189
so they are usually scanning around in

52
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,470
the internet and found that these

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,020
wireless traffic lights actually have a

54
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,380
GSM uplink so for monitoring and

55
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,060
configuration and stuff like that they

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,440
are

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,240
the online so they were able to log in

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,120
and do some stuff so this was covered in

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
the news last year and just very

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,250
recently and Mike Osman and Dominic

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,510
spill they drove with some traffic

62
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,450
lights with infrared so today we want to

63
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,340
look at this big antenna and s you might

64
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,470
guess that doesn't look like GSM so call

65
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,900
it GSM uplink they maybe didn't put this

66
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,540
on the on the traffic light so yeah I

67
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,370
was I was looking into this and one

68
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,010
friend of mine said whenever he's close

69
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,690
to this traffic lights is da be his

70
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,550
digital audio radio just stops working

71
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:59,330
so let's look around in that area and

72
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,030
actually that's a that's a band which is

73
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,750
kind of to reach and allocate it so it's

74
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,910
kind land mobile radio I don't not sure

75
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,790
how the translation is and Germany's big

76
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,980
leaps punk and usually you have some FM

77
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,140
modulation there so I use the RTL SDR

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,970
RTL SDR dongle that we've already seen

79
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,920
today lots and I think all guys know it

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,380
and just started GQ rx and indeed there

81
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,970
was a very strong signal when I was

82
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,160
close to the traffic light okay and

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,200
usually on these pants they are FM

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,150
modulated and just tried it and there

85
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,030
were some the signals look good which

86
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,730
came out of there and my my normal

87
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,470
workflow when when doing these things is

88
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,970
there's now really some really great

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,130
tooling so we have cheeky where X where

90
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,870
you have seen where I could easily see

91
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,640
the signal and filter the signal and

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,580
then I just did some recording to a WAV

93
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,739
file and had unloaded the WAV file in in

94
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,340
spectrum and in a minute show you the

95
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,170
tool in spectrum is really nice if you

96
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,850
just want to see get these signal

97
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,790
parameters see how it is modulated DVM

98
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,070
bits per second and stuff like there and

99
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,650
then um after I know the signal

100
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,720
parameters I just do some simple

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,390
decoding no radio so let's first look at

102
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,260
in spectrum so this is how the wav file

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,480
loaded in spectrum looks like and if

104
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,918
there's no transformation without them

105
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,750
then we have just some noise here and

106
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,870
then here you can see the traffic lights

107
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,780
so there are always slots of one second

108
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,419
and in between we have six transmissions

109
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,229
so um

110
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,729
the fact that they look a bit different

111
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,120
and basically tells you that there seems

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,860
to be a different SNR so these are

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,629
actually one traffic light and one is

114
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,189
the other traffic light so they are not

115
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,710
sending this just that one setting and

116
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,180
the others only receiving but they are

117
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,189
sending back and forth so to assert that

118
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,900
the other traffic lights are still there

119
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,509
and they are sending different types of

120
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,580
frames so basically we have some ones

121
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,050
that are slightly longer which we will

122
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,139
later see is the kind of master which

123
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,789
tells the other one what to show and the

124
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,319
other one is basically just reporting

125
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,779
back or at some points it's also telling

126
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,389
the master that there is for example a

127
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,279
car some some mobile traffic lights that

128
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,960
actually have cameras to detect if

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,419
there's a car ahead so they can maybe

130
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,999
preempt the signal and give you priority

131
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,830
and just not for always a straight

132
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,610
schedule okay so so this is a very very

133
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,009
rough so soon out version of the signal

134
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,469
so let's have a bit a closer look so

135
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,990
this is also in spectrum still it allows

136
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,229
you to look at the signal and also have

137
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,779
an overlay that helps you in finding the

138
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,360
bit boundaries and with this it was

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,849
pretty obvious if you zoomed in that

140
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,449
there's some FSK modulation inside there

141
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,899
and the bitrate was 100 feet per second

142
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,289
so you always have so this is always one

143
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,289
bit and it's ordering between 1200 and

144
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,589
1800 Hertz so you either have a complete

145
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,990
cycle or one and a half cycle in there

146
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,710
so this was basically the most important

147
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,599
thing about the signal and with this I

148
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,449
kind of manually decoded the preamble

149
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,879
maybe I think in spectrum also has some

150
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,189
some some possibility to decode the

151
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,990
signal but I just manually you wrote

152
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,849
down the preamble because this is then

153
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,210
what I needed a new radio and so with

154
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,009
all knowing this I can basically come up

155
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,569
with a simple new radio flow graph to

156
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,479
decode this thing actually now I'm still

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,219
claiming that all and then it's so

158
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,020
simple and I just doing that step but I

159
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,610
think that this is the step that might

160
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,830
be the most challenging for for for

161
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,639
several people but the the message is

162
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,339
that maybe this is the most stupid way

163
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,959
to decode the signal but it's just where

164
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,779
I kind of came up with and basically

165
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,150
here in the in the last step

166
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,070
looks for the preamble and then I have

167
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,889
one custom block which is also it's just

168
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,810
one line of code it's just whenever it

169
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,490
finds the preamble it's just outputting

170
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,199
I guess 200 bits or something like that

171
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,900
so I end up with a lot of bits on my

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,550
console and I've just piped it into a

173
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,160
file and wanted to have a look at how to

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
decode how to make some sense out of the

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,550
bits and I played a bit around in vim

176
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,350
and because I like the workflow so much

177
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,940
I thought I'd give I've made a very very

178
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,130
brief video so actually this is two and

179
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,360
a half minutes of reverse engineering

180
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,940
and it's now at twice the speed so he

181
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,220
had to frame formats okay now it's just

182
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,470
selected one if you scroll up and down

183
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,620
you see very very easily the boundaries

184
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,630
where there are some information in

185
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,000
there and basically what's in the frame

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,150
is so now we get rid of that if we now

187
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,120
scroll up and down we already see some

188
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,160
some patterns in there and then I just

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,370
split it and from this it has some kind

190
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,639
of timer or C it's it seems to be a

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,530
timer that's counting upwards whenever a

192
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,080
new complete cycle begins and then here

193
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,820
I just found something which changes

194
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,310
from time to time and this turned out to

195
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,590
be actually the the faces of the traffic

196
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,020
light and in the beginning I had as some

197
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,120
repeating pattern so I thought okay this

198
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,979
is this seems to be the same thing if

199
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,289
both show the same hopefully it's two

200
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,020
times red and then started from there

201
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,020
too yeah makes make some sense out of it

202
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,080
so with this then I had at least an idea

203
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,750
of how the signal could look and I

204
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,349
created some easy interface so for the

205
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,349
web browser it just I mean you know

206
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,090
radio be already headed in the file I

207
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,729
have some very shitty that GUI which was

208
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,220
reading the file and then just showing

209
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,900
the actual state of the traffic light

210
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,570
then in a web browser and then of course

211
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,659
I had to go outside and hope you didn't

212
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,979
drink too much beer because it's really

213
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,958
shaky here was really cold and so I had

214
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,430
two different types of traffic light

215
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,050
this one was directly in front of our

216
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,330
University and so this was really

217
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,890
convenient to work except there it was

218
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,690
in height and pretty cold and then

219
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,910
another one where I also have a video on

220
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,350
my website so if you want to give it a

221
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,990
try but here it was just with the light

222
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,860
ray would

223
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,360
just much easier to see that it's kind

224
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,660
of yeah following the traffic light okay

225
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,620
so that was the I actually can receive

226
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,420
it and whenever actually I was pretty

227
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,780
happy with that and already kind of good

228
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,570
enough but whenever I showed it to

229
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,490
someone the obvious question was yeah

230
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,710
and I thought okay at least I should

231
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,080
kind of include it in the talk a bit and

232
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,850
and say a word about it and okay I

233
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,560
thought about okay how can I transmit I

234
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,930
have one of those but I'm very sure that

235
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,060
it doesn't allow me to transmit out of

236
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,670
the amateur radio bands so maybe it can

237
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,700
receive their but chance transmitting is

238
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,310
limited I looked on ebay you can of

239
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,760
course buy lots of the DS land mobile

240
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,530
radios or however they are actually

241
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,230
called but they are bit expensive or a

242
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,990
bit over 100 zeros usually then I

243
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,880
remember that at some point I bought

244
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,620
this incredibly cheap shitty device from

245
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,340
China and never I never actually used it

246
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,830
and it turns out with this 25 euro it's

247
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,570
kind of very nice because it's cheap and

248
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,970
it's portable and even in the link on

249
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,430
Amazon it was 172 yeah if you play

250
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,910
around with it that yeah yeah turns out

251
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,920
that that can actually work or at least

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
I wanted to give it a try

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,280
good what can you do there is the

254
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,770
obvious way like going beside the

255
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,800
traffic light which is screaming in the

256
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,720
in the in the radio and then you so

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,550
you're basically chairing disrupting the

258
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,080
communication but it's pretty boring

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,300
because always possible but when I had

260
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,580
that on my block there was immediately

261
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,160
somebody who wrote me that he tried that

262
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,270
obviously or for whatever reason he knew

263
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,650
that when you just jam it it's just

264
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,150
flashing orange which makes a lot of

265
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,040
sense because this the kind of fallback

266
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,890
solution and what else can you do so the

267
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,560
the actual question is like could use

268
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,780
spoof transmission means like you could

269
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,060
generate this signals to yourself so

270
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,620
that the traffic light would accept it

271
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,240
so that you can actually trigger the

272
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
traffic light this is what yeah most

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,660
people seem to be interested in but

274
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,810
as I said it's most of them have cameras

275
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,350
and you should not mess around and also

276
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,230
with the cheese I'm uplink they will

277
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,589
they know probably if you're doing some

278
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,630
shady stuff with it so I thought but but

279
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,910
still I I wanted to see if if there is

280
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,889
at least some I can come up with a proof

281
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,740
of concept that maybe you could further

282
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,589
investigate it so okay I did another GUI

283
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:38,940
but this time obviously I wanted to

284
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,060
trigger it then I again had a new radio

285
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,880
flow graph where I wanted to when I kind

286
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,529
of watched generating the signal that I

287
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,290
just showed you and this time it was

288
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,569
just really plain new radio blocks so

289
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:53,370
there's nothing where I what I had to

290
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,680
code it was basically I have to signal

291
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,930
sources which produced me one hundred

292
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,000
one thousand two hundred Hertz signal

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,110
and D 1800 signal and then I have some

294
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,180
some logic with the bits which is kind

295
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,050
of turning one on it off that's in a

296
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,810
high-level overview of the thing so what

297
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,939
what this then does is this time it's

298
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:18,000
not connected to SDR or software I find

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,300
radio stuff but this time it's just

300
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,160
outputting the signal into an audio sync

301
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,060
and then it was kind of a no risk no fun

302
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,509
I just connected it directly the line

303
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,500
out of my PC to the through the radio

304
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,949
actually when you look online they don't

305
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,810
recommend doing that so I used a USB

306
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,279
over the account because I was hoping

307
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,290
maybe then just the USB version is

308
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,139
broken and not directly my PC but at

309
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,060
least for for me it works actually you

310
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,649
should decouple them I guess but I'm not

311
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,269
really good in circuits and stuff like

312
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,019
that okay so the thing is if you enable

313
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,560
box so um I guess all the immersive like

314
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,829
know it is you can switch between

315
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,920
push-to-talk and that the radio just

316
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,139
turns on whenever there is some some

317
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,449
signals so I enabled Vox on the radio

318
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,880
connected it to the line in of the

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,310
microphone and yeah there you basically

320
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,569
then have your your transceiver and I

321
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,070
just have a

322
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,100
team of the set up in in on my desk at

323
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,560
university so you see I have another GUI

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,200
here then there's new radio stuff going

325
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
on and it's then connected to the the

326
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,170
handheld radio here and on the other

327
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,510
side there's the other new radio

328
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,610
receiver that I just showed you that was

329
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,560
working with the normal traffic light so

330
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
it's the same frequency the very same

331
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,030
thing everything's the same so I was

332
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,500
really generating a signal just as the

333
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,800
as the traffic light so yeah so much for

334
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,060
the you can also maybe transmit at least

335
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,760
in general so yeah so that's it for my

336
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,860
side I hope and yeah you'll find it a

337
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,610
bit funny application and also and now

338
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,320
motivated to play a bit around with this

339
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
cheap technologies that are out there

340
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:26,720
okay thanks is it is it hot is it half

341
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,520
I'm sorry actually I thought it's way

342
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,160
too much Condon so now I'm rushing

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,720
around through the slides I'm sorry yeah

344
00:14:39,720 --> 00:15:00,110
so if you have any questions so please

345
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,310
exactly so that's usually what happens

346
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,320
that if somebody does it then I had done

347
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,790
that five years ago or something like

348
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,000
that

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,940
but actually series knows or nobody

350
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,950
wrote me so I I wouldn't know if anybody

351
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,310
I I also tried to different yeah I got

352
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,690
emails from from other guys who were

353
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,640
looking into that but none of them were

354
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,280
actually transmitting something yeah

355
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,210
what this oh yeah

356
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:45,640
this is the anechoic chamber of what all

357
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,170
this has metallized windows where

358
00:15:47,170 --> 00:16:03,670
nothing gets out exactly so it's there

359
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,260
seems to be the configuration always

360
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,080
seems to be that the one is kind of the

361
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,240
main be kind of the master of the

362
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,490
communication yeah and the other such as

363
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,800
kind of reporting back periodically so

364
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
that this master actually knows that

365
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,070
what he was transmitting actually was

366
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,020
received so not that the master turns

367
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,250
green and the other doesn't

368
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,340
yeah and also on this frequency you

369
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,930
don't have to space them that close

370
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,500
because you're actually on 170 megahertz

371
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,850
you get some range yeah

372
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,980
so I don't know that particular - but so

373
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,470
if I already try a via if I tried

374
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,209
another tool that was too recent release

375
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,709
of shmoocon which is called air wave I

376
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,490
guess oh how did you say wave converter

377
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,949
sorry and yeah I don't know that

378
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,199
particular - but today in the morning we

379
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,970
had a panel where we said about like it

380
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,740
sometimes really hard to get started

381
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,299
with new radio and then when I had a

382
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,369
look another look at my slides then I

383
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:29,299
knew that okay now now I say from I have

384
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,640
all signal parameters I know the

385
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,950
preamble and now I just have to build

386
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,110
the ignore radio receiver and then this

387
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,150
is when I realized that most likely this

388
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,830
will be the tricky part for most of the

389
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,570
people so that they really come from

390
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,970
this now because in loading it in

391
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,100
spectrum is pretty straightforward I

392
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,559
would say and then also having some high

393
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,929
level overview but then from that to the

394
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,880
to the transmitter that might be the

395
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,850
part where people draw off yeah and but

396
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,330
maybe this is something where you we

397
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,700
could come up with some default standard

398
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,190
solution where you may become like just

399
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,679
plug in different different values like

400
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,020
one for on-off keying one generic one

401
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,980
one for all FM and stuff like that for

402
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,360
there are some out there but they are I

403
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:24,350
have distributed also I do you don't

404
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,850
even need the parameters yeah okay okay

405
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,429
so so these wave converters yeah should

406
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,290
I should have a look at it and see yeah

407
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,129
yes

408
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,049
no because I I think it's because so it

409
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,809
is really a kind of really

410
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,580
straightforward and I think it also

411
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,019
doesn't make a lot of sense I had to

412
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,149
look at two different traffic lights

413
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,009
they all are slightly different also

414
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,570
they might have different configurations

415
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,419
so most likely that wouldn't work out of

416
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,279
the box either way so you have to do

417
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,799
some slight adaptions but the the main

418
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,570
point is actually that this is something

419
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,779
very straightforward you can just have a

420
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:18,070
look at it and also it shouldn't it

421
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,799
shouldn't be just a I just download

422
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,340
compile and run a thing I guess yeah

423
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,559
yeah they this the ones at university

424
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,359
they actually rent and it looks like

425
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,279
then they then the company is doing the

426
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,029
monitoring of the traffic lights and

427
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:42,190
also most likely the configuration stuff

428
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,499
everything remotely you just put them

429
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,679
there

430
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:56,720
Engineering

431
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,340
yeah when I look back actually then

432
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,680
mainly I was always had to do something

433
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
with traffic even I actually didn't

434
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,140
think about it so what my other projects

435
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,290
were I received telemetry from buses so

436
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,050
I had a OpenStreetMap where you could

437
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,210
see the buses in part one driving around

438
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,780
and I had a person tation two years ago

439
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,690
with RDS TMC so this is the digital

440
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,620
subcarrier on FM broadcast data so there

441
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,210
there's also some traffic information

442
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,190
modulated on there so your usual GPS

443
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,440
device gets it from the FM broadcast

444
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,860
stations and also I have a project which

445
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,440
is a way label this is decoding my car

446
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,460
key fob for example then you get the 64

447
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,160
bit rollin rollin code out of it and yes

448
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,190
stuff like that so there there's tons of

449
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,860
this very very low hanging fruits out

450
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,010
there way which can some have some fun

451
00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:03,780
playing around with yeah yeah Italy when

452
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,330
you walk when you're close to it then it

453
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,670
should be very very dominant and clear

454
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,070
that it's there I mean if you have

455
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,320
absolutely no idea about the band so

456
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,690
with this I really had an idea and I

457
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,700
also if I wouldn't have known that this

458
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,010
it kind of interferes with the di b

459
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,250
audio stuff then i would have started

460
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,140
there so if you know or have a rough

461
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,670
idea about the frequency allocation

462
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,430
there are some spots to look but yeah in

463
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,950
general if you just use three qrx and

464
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,810
scroll through the band like i guess you

465
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,790
should see it very dominant for example

466
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,500
with the busses also I had no clue where

467
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,620
they are but when when one drove by me

468
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,020
very close it was just the M so you

469
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,190
couldn't miss it

470
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,840
he yeah but before for this small

471
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,809
distances nobody else let's don't even

472
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:02,200
have to pull it off oh yeah yeah so this

473
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,610
is 1/2 lambda 1/2 dipole yeah so what

474
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,799
was it 2 meter band 1 meter antenna I

475
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,158
don't know

476
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,410
[Applause]
