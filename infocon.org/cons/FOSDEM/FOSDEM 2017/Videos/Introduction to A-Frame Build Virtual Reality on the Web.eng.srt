1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,299
is

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,210
dishing serving up I just want to make a

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,639
couple of announcements if it's not the

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:10,600
first time that you are in the

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,910
motherland even today we do have a

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,160
cut-off candidate I invited trade and

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,240
it's over here lately / Muslim CLC is

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,310
different from the folder Mondays I

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,920
encourage you to look it up if you are a

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,740
developer we have a survey going on at

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,019
this link thoughtfully search for them

12
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,800
17 or in upper cases the presentation I

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,020
want to repeat that we do want to try

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,879
the latest version of Firefox the

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,129
nightly one that gets all the code in

16
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:44,020
from the developers in real time not

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,110
after its polished and looks good you

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,530
can reach we can find the bill that

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,809
nightly that mozilla.org any stylus from

20
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,379
there and if you already contributing to

21
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,300
open source if you are here if you like

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,129
us to tell us why you contribute and why

23
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:08,350
this is important for you our next

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,470
speaker is a journey from Italy I hope I

25
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,960
said alright our source if not you know

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,390
there are a lot of Italians around here

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,340
so be careful what you say the last

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,780
thing I know about them is like they

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,030
really hate Hawaiian pizza is like they

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,750
have an allergy

31
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,539
[Applause]

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,239
[Applause]

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:25,390
and what is reality reality to create

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,450
experience and not experience where you

35
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,709
can go inside using some tools different

36
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:39,130
tools but is different because it set on

37
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,070
the web and it's very difficult to

38
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,170
handle it was very difficult sorry

39
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,980
because I take this this quote as my

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,720
starting of metal because I think the

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,489
situation where a frame was created was

42
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,250
like this that it's all to create the

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,560
same quality reality experience online

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,100
on the web and because mostly because

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,980
the value proposition of the web is to

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,769
be low frictional to have low friction

47
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:19,930
you click on a link you get an output

48
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,750
and you don't want to download other

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,459
software to do it so you just navigate

50
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,130
into your browser and use the tools you

51
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,200
already have and it's very difficult to

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,860
do it with virtual reality because a lot

53
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,150
of stuff on that in order to give you

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,550
the experience so a lot of different

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,400
devices and different categories of

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,920
devices so we got a card boards that

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,950
note the simples one you can build it

58
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,050
your own and print a schematic and built

59
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,489
it in your house

60
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,890
you got a headset so you can use your

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,269
cell phone in order to try give to a

62
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,769
reality and adjust the box you have just

63
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,168
boxes with made by plastic and you can

64
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,060
put your cell phone inside and the

65
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,690
regather

66
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,220
also the HTM G the head-mounted the

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,580
devices like oculus rift it HTC by so

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,060
different categories to the developer

69
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,790
side means that you have end all

70
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,930
different kind of SDKs or integration

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,169
into your and it's very difficult to do

72
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,330
because the variety of the health the

73
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,130
devices is ten thousand devices object

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,350
kind of different handling of input and

75
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,910
output to sorts so it's very hard it's

76
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,430
very it's a mess but notes on multiple

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,700
devices so you can use it as well on HTC

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,790
by

79
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,210
on desktop or mobile platform also as a

80
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,050
flat experience without being a vehicle

81
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,970
reality like using visors or stuff like

82
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,190
that you can just browse with your

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,020
browser inside the scene like you do

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,740
usually on Facebook when you try to

85
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,540
explore a 360 degrees photo or video and

86
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,710
I think is already set about to do this

87
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,320
from scratch you don't have to integrate

88
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,550
anything what you need is just a browser

89
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,500
with WebGL support and now mostly a

90
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,140
browser I've got support hmm all

91
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,050
especially I'm about just Nene doesn't

92
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,660
have it but it's crazy because it's an

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,800
old browser now it's not by use it and

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
in order to make some stuff works well

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,490
on every platform so that's this

96
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,010
framework works combined with a lot of

97
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,620
other JavaScript frameworks very famous

98
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,290
like Vijay yes or d3.js

99
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,300
and react angular radix and also do the

100
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,310
jquery for her at the cutting edge level

101
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,060
technology level it works also combined

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,680
with jquery because we are talking just

103
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,250
about manipulating the Dom manipulating

104
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,440
some object in HTML it's a declarative

105
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,570
HTML system and it's made by entity

106
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,500
component it's sort of a collection of

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,790
tools so that you can use to build this

108
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,870
web reality and we got about 4 models of

109
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,100
geometry and

110
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,920
nations and other stuff that commitment

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,720
could bring you to create a nation like

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,390
that this is the the the starting point

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,020
a very reality project made by iPhone

114
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,380
and I'm trying to explain you because if

115
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,260
the doc the doctor background doesn't

116
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,650
help us but ok this is a scene it's a

117
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,820
tag and it's the time that open the

118
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,910
scene that render a canvas in HTML so

119
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,560
it's very massacre and inside the AC in

120
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,770
the tag you can paint also some

121
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,860
primitives that are entities preeminent

122
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,620
entities that you can use to remember

123
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,210
maybe a sphere that is a bilious fear or

124
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,370
the most important step is that we

125
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,580
declare everything by HTML data tag here

126
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,880
so you get you say you to to the

127
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,480
component well where to position it into

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,690
the scene the size and also the other

129
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,540
stuff like maybe a particular one of the

130
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,909
I don't know that the disfigured the

131
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,860
radius or other software you had hidden

132
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,960
depth so and you can also attach it to

133
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,050
colors textures patterns and other stuff

134
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,730
you can also render a video on

135
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,709
as a texture primitive element so it's

136
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:58,620
very easy to use if you want we'll just

137
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,709
HTML and JavaScript technology you are

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,490
able to do a complete butyl reality game

139
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,209
and as a flaky already mentioned before

140
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,740
me javascript is fun so you can use it

141
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,060
to build video games maybe inside this

142
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,500
framework obviously the 360 is for all

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,800
these 360 degrees photos are very easy

144
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
to do with FM because you just declare

145
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,579
an escalated and escalated is just a tag

146
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:40,690
drop the entire environment into the AC

147
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,260
and so it's the literally the sky of the

148
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,940
scene but if you have made the photo

149
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,130
especially an angle that has a

150
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,050
proportion of two and one like I did

151
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,420
here I don't know if you can read it I

152
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,850
take a photo from a Flickr photo group

153
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,310
you can find it easily there are plenty

154
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,600
of photographs now that go downtown and

155
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,100
take picture of this beautiful squares

156
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,029
so you can use it for just testing but

157
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,199
pose it into the escal talk and just a

158
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,010
search attribute and it will render your

159
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,310
environment in 360 same stuff for the

160
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,329
video and the videos for tag I like to

161
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,569
imagine me taking video lecture the guy

162
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,750
I do everything do it in my office but

163
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,290
ok and maybe do time is a

164
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,810
is a type that you put on a surface and

165
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,389
you can run the video on the surface

166
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,279
like it is a texture and the adidas per

167
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,670
entity is an entity that you use in

168
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,550
order to make the video as the

169
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,819
environment of all your project so you

170
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,209
can navigate to the video like I saw a

171
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,240
demonstration by mid by Discovery

172
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,690
Channel that they do amazing documentary

173
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,600
and you can live the experience of the

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,290
sky Daniels heart sky and so you can go

175
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,470
[Music]

176
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,899
you can try skydiving maybe doing this

177
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:32,579
stuff so is an entity an entity

178
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,649
obviously is an empty placeholder that

179
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,380
we can feel with behaviors and we can

180
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,470
feel with functionality and appearance

181
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,839
stuff we do it in JavaScript and it's

182
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,720
very easy if you know what that be I was

183
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,740
before Efraim you know that it's a very

184
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,399
huge improvement in doing web VR because

185
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,930
you have to use 3GS and other stop to

186
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,690
render the environment and it was very

187
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,589
hard to do this is quite similar to tree

188
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,740
jus declaration type it's very easy

189
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,579
because you just call your skin the

190
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,430
scheme are just the properties that you

191
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,569
can pass through the entity through HTML

192
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:26,860
and then you can create anything with

193
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,949
JavaScript in there so you can take it

194
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,069
deploy it and we bring it into your

195
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,319
environment just declaring an entity and

196
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,500
if I'm

197
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,400
any entity and call it as you want so

198
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,780
this is the basic because you can't

199
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,380
confuse it it's a different from an

200
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,160
object because it's not an object if you

201
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,770
try to think that in two dimensions like

202
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,050
flag issues before you can use an object

203
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,120
to map everything because you can reuse

204
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,400
the same property of the object but

205
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,420
including spaces you need something that

206
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,260
you can combine so if you get an entity

207
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,170
you can put entity inside another entity

208
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,800
and combine the behavior one entity

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,380
which I don't know maybe the Adama tulip

210
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,200
the other one entity and make an entity

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:35,450
a bigger entity that makes more stuff is

212
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,400
a component ecosystem where you can

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,990
download a entity created by other

214
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,200
people but also libraries and stuff that

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,680
could be useful for your project and

216
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:56,660
because you can put it into a project

217
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,200
but there is another to stop that frame

218
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,970
release it in the fourth version a

219
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,140
better version and this is the inspector

220
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,819
this is the coolest I've ever seen

221
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,710
[Music]

222
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,630
with this you can expect the same it's

223
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,510
included in in the a frame so just you

224
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,840
just include your library and click ctrl

225
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,460
Alt + I on Linux and windows I don't I

226
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,550
can't remember in Macintosh but I think

227
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,530
it's quite the same and you go into the

228
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,840
inspector and this factor is cool

229
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,450
because you can also like editing the

230
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,020
stuff and

231
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,379
right code here to show the inspector

232
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:02,319
okay I'll try to go into inspector hood

233
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,600
okay and I'm here close it

234
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,879
this is the inspector I can inspect the

235
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,529
scene directly I can also inspect the

236
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,040
element of the scene I can change

237
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,959
behavior and the geometry I'm sorry but

238
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:32,329
this cream is very small try to oh okay

239
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:40,309
don't worry we can go back to the scene

240
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,430
okay and this is this is what I created

241
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,829
with the photo I told you before this is

242
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:49,100
bath salts and I put just this three

243
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,709
object inside so we can manipulate it

244
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:59,240
with the inspector I try to do it maybe

245
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,809
I reload

246
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,820
yeah

247
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,010
so you can change everything by clicking

248
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:28,530
oh come on it's just milk it was a cool

249
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,200
future better we can't see it okay

250
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,990
so I explained I will stop like if you

251
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,210
change the behavior of this government

252
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,080
okay I change the position I can see it

253
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,900
in this video space component is now and

254
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,010
[Applause]

255
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,890
element it's it's quite easy and it make

256
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,880
me choose

257
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,400
okay I take the entity it makes me

258
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,170
choose a list of the component my camera

259
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,050
canvas code sets also the bug and a cone

260
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,839
or light you can run the light inside

261
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,040
the scene and after I put I can change

262
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,430
everything by changing here and I can't

263
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,910
say I also can't say a bit export to my

264
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,560
HTML so I can use it as a 2d mutilation

265
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,710
software virtual reality less than

266
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,370
blender but something like this or you

267
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,550
can also use object that you run web by

268
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,610
blender you made another you can embed

269
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,040
it as an object inside your scene and

270
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,670
then with the inspector you can easily

271
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,470
manipulate it and save it so this is a

272
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,660
very very big very very big improvement

273
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,870
I let you see the orchid the website

274
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,760
this is the central website where you

275
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,880
can find everything you need about a

276
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,070
frame and also the demos some Venus need

277
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:18,030
require obviously handset HTC buy in

278
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,150
this case but if you want to try it

279
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,000
especially and

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,860
that it's banging I'm not dicted to to

281
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,320
to first-person shooter so this could be

282
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,120
funny and this is you can try it to know

283
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,330
your new zealand

284
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,600
we are in the second floor and you can

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,160
find us with HTC vive so you can try it

286
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:56,500
ask a little bit but try to find where

287
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,280
plucky or me or other people there so

288
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,180
will be let your time more sweet and and

289
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,410
then bring me back to my ok presentation

290
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,700
so how can you start developing with

291
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,340
this you can start to easy manner one is

292
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,450
by installing the boilerplate why do you

293
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,190
need a boilerplate you need a boiler

294
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,180
plate because it wants a node server on

295
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,680
localhost and it avoids you sometimes

296
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,820
stop the pipe a little bit frustrating

297
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,100
like cross-domain

298
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,440
issues and if you want a local server

299
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
that is completely set up if you

300
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,280
download it from frame by the paper I

301
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,850
think you are fmvela Pitt and it's just

302
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,180
an index.html with a basic example where

303
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,030
you can start and inspect it and do it

304
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,150
with also with drag-and-drop if you want

305
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,390
or by code if you are a coder or content

306
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,580
with content technology if you are a

307
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,260
designer and this is the most short way

308
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,910
to learn how to do it and we

309
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,170
[Music]

310
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,590
getting started impact on the website is

311
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,240
full of for example you can start phone

312
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,180
call there is my coat pan that I he

313
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,010
showed before I tried to manipulate

314
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,920
before and companies are team mo my

315
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,380
perfect because you've just intimate I

316
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,890
suggest the inclusion of the JavaScript

317
00:20:45,890 --> 00:21:04,190
file and then you can also see that it's

318
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,210
very active I found a lot of libraries

319
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,790
there especially the particular

320
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,580
rendering library that allows me to

321
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,900
render starts in a project it was

322
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,630
included also in the FM registry after

323
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,900
but I discovered it by reading the blog

324
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,440
so it's very helpful and a circular flow

325
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,960
obviously because if you need something

326
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,810
that is stackoverflow and also the

327
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,590
twitter account if you are interested in

328
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,820
the art technology I invite you to fill

329
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,200
in this Twitter account that is the

330
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,810
