1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,510
so

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,690
thank you for being here my name is

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,420
Gilly army and I'm representing tooks

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,469
the quite universal circuit simulator as

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,299
a side note the first name was actually

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,570
cute from the Qt framework but they got

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,760
a message that well it's not related to

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,369
cute please change the name so they

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,619
changed to quite universal circuit

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,369
simulator so my talk is about another

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,900
view and they start to stop the

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,290
development and some remarks and if time

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,540
allows I will show you some short demo

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,860
of what the two is about so the project

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,590
started in 2003 it was created in tu

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,079
Berlin by Michael my graphene Stephan

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,329
Yin the first one created the user

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,850
interface the second one created the the

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,129
sober or the engine it was from the

20
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:56,760
beginning

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,660
GPL 2 plus to date it has more than 20

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,940
contributors it's translated into about

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,570
20 languages it's cross platform and the

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,630
user base it's is varied it's from

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,320
education from researchers hobbyists and

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,280
even the industry you have some stats

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,990
here for the website that was there from

28
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,090
2005 number of downloads this is from

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,400
SourceForge where the code is hosted

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,680
since the beginning the binaries in the

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,990
source the tar balls and on the graph

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,150
below we have the count for for Windows

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,330
binaries that were released like 13 days

34
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,900
ago so you have roughly yeah

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,580
four hundred three hundred downloads

36
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,610
weekly for this part with the windows

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,360
binary and I mentioned that the original

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,770
creators they are not no longer active

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,430
on the project around 2011-12 they

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,200
dropped the project so it went orphaned

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
and and the community adopted its own

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,620
the main features it's basically a

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,310
schematic capture a simulator and it has

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,650
data visualization butene it has

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,909
equation system for pre and

46
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,730
post-processing of the signals as a

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,930
component library

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,810
which is also parameterised with common

49
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,239
components it has also designed and

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
synthesis tools for modeling if you want

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,180
to write models it has some some feature

52
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,970
to import spice netlist s-- it's quite

53
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,470
limited on the constructs that it can

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,930
handle it has a beauty in component it's

55
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,599
called equation defined device it's

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,819
quite powerful because you can really

57
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,060
write rewrite the equations for see a

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
transistor model in this kind of even

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,069
graphical fashion which is quite quite

60
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,230
handy for development and it also has a

61
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,440
very large a model builder or loader and

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,290
it has some process yeah post processing

63
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,269
capability that you can export it and a

64
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,180
new cap or Python or Tov and the

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,389
dependencies that we have its c++ cute

66
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,269
for we still struggling to remove cute

67
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,720
tree from from the source but we are

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,519
working on that it builds with Auto

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,569
tools and see make and super for for the

70
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,420
first produce for the simulator and the

71
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,419
parsers are also written in flex bison

72
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,239
we depend on a DMS for the very log a

73
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,400
part and the documentation most of it is

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
written in late AK there is some

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,470
experimental work or I would say

76
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,900
external work that's not in the main

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,290
line which is this Fork it's called

78
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,459
pukes s which is by Vadim Kuznetsov and

79
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,319
Mike Vincent the first one from Russia

80
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
the second from UK which is a pretty

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,949
full feature spice front-end based on

82
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,900
the cukes schematic capture it can work

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,060
with vengi spice theissens pi suppose

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,389
they made up very large a generators

85
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,979
that work with this equation to find

86
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,220
devices that you can make your device

87
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,409
graphically and then generate a Verilog

88
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,989
a code they also made recently some

89
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,010
extensions for X spice so they can also

90
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,500
in the similar fashion make C code that

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,599
can be linked into ng spice for instance

92
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,530
and spice oppas I guess the previous

93
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,919
speaker

94
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,020
Felix mentioned in Luke Sutter which is

95
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,539
one before that he started to make a

96
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,500
replacement engine based

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,900
no cap for cukes later and there is also

98
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,990
an effort that we saw this year this

99
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,440
user he has a to that press lates into G

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,860
skin and he managed to to import the

101
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,320
schematics from cukes to into a G scheme

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,000
so that's interesting so for support for

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
the project we have the main website at

104
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,340
the moment we have account six active

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,710
maintainer Zoar developers it's me it's

106
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,660
Claudio that's in Italy Vadim in Russia

107
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,030
Felix that's here that's located in UK

108
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,100
now but in Germany and the rest that's

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,350
in Spain and mikerickson bring some

110
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,000
that's in UK we have I think is a quite

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,590
good documentation especially the

112
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,770
tutorials in the technical manual you

113
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,860
can find on the website they are very

114
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,560
well written in cover quite a lot of

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,990
ground we have yeah a traditional we

116
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,390
have most things on on SourceForge for

117
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,790
example de binary's we have the git

118
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,310
repository but we are gradually phasing

119
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,800
it out in favor of github we still have

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,620
the issue tracker enable there and the

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,830
forum is sometimes active and the Middle

122
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,820
East so also hosted there on github most

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,200
of the work is happening there now and

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,990
most of the issues are also there we

125
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,240
ported the wiki from SourceForge when it

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,000
was disabled into github and we from

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,290
there we also enable continuous

128
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,720
integration with Travis and up Vale for

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,229
Linux OS X and Windows so if you look

130
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,940
into the package what kind of tools do

131
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,340
you have there as graphical interface

132
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,720
you have cukes which is the schematic

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,790
capture and then you have design tools

134
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,090
or helpers that is for active filter

135
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,830
attenuator attenuator specific animators

136
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,720
it has a beauty editor that we are

137
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,610
facing out as well it has a - for

138
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,820
developing passive filters there is a

139
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,740
small help - that's being also phased

140
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,280
out in fear of read the docs

141
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,540
documentation online there is a matching

142
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,240
tool there is the library and there is a

143
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,450
small resistor - color conversion codes

144
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,210
that's useful for students

145
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,259
and the results are transmission line

146
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:50,840
calculator in total we have now it's

147
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,229
less but it was 170 components we

148
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,930
removed some non GPL components recently

149
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,409
but it's a we are adding new components

150
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,969
for RF so the count is about the same

151
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,009
from the common line you can access

152
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,409
cukes which is the interface the

153
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,349
schematics you can use the cukes later

154
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,659
which is a simulator and cukes conf that

155
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,580
converts between formats also imports

156
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,939
the spice netlist into the cukes utter

157
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,400
native netlist and we also interface to

158
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
third-party tools like ASCO which is an

159
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,110
optimizer a DMS XML which does the very

160
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,960
lock a to code or C++ conversion that we

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,629
need to run the models we can run from

162
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,120
the the schematic very log free HDL that

163
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,050
we are working to replace by by GL

164
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,460
hopefully for the next release and there

165
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,229
are some conversion to for from pspice

166
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,229
to spice and then you can also run there

167
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,169
is a dock where you can run octave

168
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,330
directly from from the user interface

169
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,509
and python is mostly scripts for parsing

170
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,099
the data so quickly this screenshots but

171
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,169
i also blood demo in the end so this is

172
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,710
the main interface you have on the left

173
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,349
the yeah you can you can have many

174
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,389
project as many projects as one this

175
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,689
reflects your working directory you

176
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,779
synced with the file system you can have

177
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,000
different contents for each project and

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,949
then on the right you can have either

179
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,860
circuits or in-line visualization or you

180
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,139
can have also separate tabs only for

181
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,360
visualization so you can make quite nice

182
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,279
looking documents to document your your

183
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,159
simulations or models so we have a

184
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,349
component tab where you can drop down

185
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,469
most of the buting components and you

186
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,240
have libraries which are either spice

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,970
based or parameterized parameter based

188
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,829
parameterization of the buting

189
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,740
components and yeah as i said you can

190
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,920
have a nice separate documentation or

191
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
visualization

192
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,190
tab for for documenting if you like or

193
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,269
simply to look good a few of the tools

194
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,490
this is merged on the latest release

195
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,209
it's for developing or designing active

196
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,860
filters so you include the parameters

197
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,370
and then it visualizes for you the

198
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,769
dyskinetic and then on press of

199
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,720
calculate and copy to kill part you can

200
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,699
just paste it into your schematic and

201
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,660
then have it running on the simulator

202
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,470
similarly you have this passive

203
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,360
attenuators there is a whole range of

204
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,660
simulator topologies that you can you

205
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,949
can input there and get the schematic

206
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:42,209
ready for simulation we had that which

207
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,329
is the help very simple like

208
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,410
introductory help that's now migrated to

209
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,639
that website this is going to be removed

210
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,410
then we have also this matching parts

211
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,440
let's then you have the library where

212
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,360
you have you can drag and drop the

213
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,740
components from this dialog or from from

214
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,040
the dock that you have on the the user

215
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,810
interface and this is the calculation

216
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,990
from colors to value or value to colors

217
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,440
it was okay then you have transmission

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,660
line calculations there are new

219
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
components that are coming on for the

220
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,720
next release and but it has a dozen of

221
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
components that can be already now used

222
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,470
for transmission lines calculations then

223
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,279
you have also dispersive filters and as

224
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,139
I said what can you do you have you have

225
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,240
what can you use from the command line

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,839
so the user interface can can be used

227
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,660
for generating the netlist for schematic

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,550
it can also print the schematic and

229
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,810
there are some comments to dump the

230
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,639
companies that we have so this could

231
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,779
help if you are looking to extracting

232
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,430
the component descriptions you can you

233
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,190
can hack into that too to do it the

234
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,220
simulator supports DC transient AC as

235
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,980
parameter and harmonic balance is just

236
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,709
for resistors capacitors and inductors

237
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,339
at the moment

238
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,290
I highlighted here as parameter because

239
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,360
this is to my knowledge one of the only

240
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,389
tools that does that on the open source

241
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,709
it's directly right you can do with a

242
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,209
system elections but this is a beauty

243
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,529
feature of the tool that's it well it

244
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,680
started also the first commits of the

245
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,620
simulator and the user interface were to

246
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,740
accommodate as parameter and the quacks

247
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,439
Kampf is a 2 that converts between a few

248
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:46,059
formats that I used to visualize or to

249
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,720
cover net lists and library components

250
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,949
and yeah this is a bit of the problem

251
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:57,309
that we might talk later on the the

252
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,680
panel that we have custom file formats

253
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,389
for the schematic which is the same for

254
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,999
the library and also the netlist and the

255
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,410
data files they are plain text files

256
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,459
that are also custom so we might work on

257
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,069
that too to collaboration it's a bit

258
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:14,199
difficult makes more difficult because

259
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,459
of that ok on the front of Verilog a we

260
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,470
had quite a lot of models we still have

261
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,929
quite a lot of models however due to

262
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:26,079
licensing issues we we had to remove

263
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,670
three of the industry standard models

264
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,059
they were with like DSD 3 clause

265
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,120
licenses which are incompatible and we

266
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,999
stripped them out from the repository we

267
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,649
are not moving them to a non-free

268
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,990
repository you've got to be a bit of a

269
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,970
backlash from the model developers but

270
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,139
there is nothing you can do it's

271
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,660
incompatible we removed same thing with

272
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,749
a DMS there were headers that were

273
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,240
proprietary to Exelero which is

274
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,429
organization that handles they standard

275
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:01,480
so me and Felix we stripped those

276
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,639
headers and we wrote new headers and we

277
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,970
realized since a DMS - as a GPL 3 + + ya

278
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,709
concern if you've ever log a + in cukes

279
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,230
there is a limitation that it this

280
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,569
construct is not yet supported but for

281
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:19,990
most things you can compile be same 6 +

282
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,360
and some other very complicated models

283
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,179
ok they run slowly because our engine is

284
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,019
kind of slow

285
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,699
but it runs and it's not is is mostly

286
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,949
accurate compared to two commercial

287
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,999
simulators we might have to compare

288
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,499
against can look at now so and okay I

289
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,239
have a demo but we just closed this is

290
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,579
sly so I will go as time allows to the

291
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,739
demos these are the same they must run

292
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,540
West year but just for for the ones that

293
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,189
are here to get a feeling of how the two

294
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:55,660
behaves so I have this circuit with a

295
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,829
parameter sweep a macro model

296
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,829
optimization

297
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,259
that's a kind of thing that would be

298
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:10,600
interesting to see s an output to a

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,489
layout to because these micro strips are

300
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,429
basically traces on a PCB or another

301
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,470
substrate so this is something that we

302
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,989
could work with a layout to to to get it

303
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:23,739
exported that's quite interesting so how

304
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,639
you can do some very log and visual

305
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,819
simulations and okay to wrap up their

306
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:38,789
slides 19.99 sleep bug fixing clean ups

307
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,859
ongoing parting from cute three too cute

308
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:44,769
for there is this new to that's the main

309
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,689
you think that we have we did

310
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,879
integration a bit of regression testing

311
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,269
we remove the non GPL we adopted adopted

312
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,269
a new bit branching model because before

313
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,889
that we are merging everything into

314
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,989
master and it was kind of untidy now we

315
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,850
have master only four releases and we

316
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,449
have developed for development and on

317
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,359
this release cycle we closed roughly 160

318
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,910
issues regressions and and things like

319
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,779
that for the next release we coordinated

320
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,579
a bit better the efforts and we are

321
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,619
prioritizing some RF components and

322
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,029
microwave components that were developed

323
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,989
by undress and the results were junior

324
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:28,149
feature that you can slide values and we

325
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,639
run the simulation as I mentioned remove

326
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,100
or removal of packs editor and cukes

327
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,129
help we hope for a quick release but

328
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,449
there is also on other things that are

329
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,549
on the pipeline like felix is

330
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:43,569
implementing a way of loading similar to

331
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,209
new cab things into the user interface

332
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,039
which might help us on on the future and

333
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,569
this is the test the status for the

334
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,539
development and okay just put it here

335
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,179
for the PDF you have all the links you

336
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,939
might want here

337
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,379
this is also interesting we are now

338
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,029
getting more and more translations on

339
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,829
this translation platform which is which

340
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,939
is nice because then helps us some

341
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:12,699
localization of the of the tool and the

342
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,139
final remarks the project as a whole

343
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,749
aims to be very user friendly we have

344
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:19,509
advanced components and modeling

345
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,940
features we are open to collaboration

346
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,620
we hope to yeah use more the tools that

347
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,450
we have available and enter into the

348
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,550
flow of the working flow for more people

349
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,120
and your help is most welcome I do have

350
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,020
a few sly a few examples I would just

351
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,860
show so as I mentioned we have this tab

352
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,120
here with the projects then I have five

353
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,230
minutes right there show one example so

354
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,400
ideally you pick up your components from

355
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,420
here we have a library of components but

356
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,640
this is already configured so we have

357
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,420
from the context

358
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,000
this schematic I will close this now so

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,220
yeah this is a simple example where you

360
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,810
have you can enable and disable

361
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,990
parameters like that so in this moment

362
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,089
the value of this resistor is being

363
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,319
picked up for this from this equation

364
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,450
these equations can be quite complicated

365
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,270
they are pre processed and then sent to

366
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,260
the simulator and then you can run these

367
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,700
NAC simulation you get a short

368
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,480
transcript of this over and then just

369
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,260
like that you can toggle that parameter

370
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,310
into parameter sweep and then we run it

371
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,080
then you get this visualization online

372
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,510
here I will show you maybe another

373
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,100
project this is I will skip this is the

374
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,320
one I mentioned about micro scripts so

375
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,240
this is perhaps not the best frequency

376
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,210
this is for 10 gigahertz but you can

377
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,560
also do micro scripts at lower

378
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,610
frequencies that can be easily

379
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,860
manufactured on PCBs if you if you want

380
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,850
and this is something I would like to

381
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,450
see pushed forward on on the layout side

382
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,730
so and it's quite quick to run so this

383
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,880
is the SB parameters of this band pass

384
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,540
filter dock window then we have yeah the

385
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,430
intention this is a very log it can also

386
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,649
so in this case we have this very log

387
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,129
file here and you have the description

388
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,340
of the very log then it wraps it into a

389
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,740
test bench and it ships it to a cruise

390
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,009
and then you can you can run it yeah it

391
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,720
has some warnings because the wrapper is

392
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,600
not properly done but then you have the

393
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,360
counter here it's visualized here you

394
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,909
have to fix this never try the small

395
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,360
screen so and a sip for example very log

396
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,679
a here we have the equations defining

397
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,289
are all a resonating tank because we

398
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,659
don't have the V assignment we do a

399
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:25,809
trick here to transform the the the

400
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,559
inductor as a gyrator but that's that's

401
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,860
beyond the point and then you can

402
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,070
basically build this model so it's going

403
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,960
to kick in a DM s in the background

404
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,840
generate C code C++ then run the

405
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,369
compiler and then you can you predefined

406
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:48,940
the symbol for this text then you can

407
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,190
load it and you can assign an icon to it

408
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,759
and then you can now open the schematic

409
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,730
let me who's screen this so here we have

410
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,610
the equivalent into primitives and here

411
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,110
you have the equivalent from the very

412
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,710
lock a and then you can just run it then

413
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,570
it run some warnings and yeah it is just

414
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,999
the a curve from the two curves but this

415
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,440
is the idea is to have a very

416
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,809
streamlined workflow to load components

417
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,259
into into the user interface as well

418
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,899
into the simulator but that could be

419
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,669
simulated further because this manual

420
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,549
steps are not necessary as Felix show

421
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,080
before we have we can have comments on

422
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,139
the your netlist that make this

423
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,360
machinery or into the stimulator itself

424
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,869
so we are working to Twitter replace

425
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,260
that or to streamline this process

426
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,740
so as closing note chooks is about

427
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,820
schematic and simulation we don't have

428
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,590
any PCB we don't have the concepts of

429
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,809
footprints so to do that we have to

430
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,389
interact with other projects and if you

431
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,010
want to see that happening please help

432
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:20,940
us different fashions so the question is

433
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,429
what's to what degree our custom netlist

434
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,860
is compatible to spice it's not it's a

435
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,220
different format altogether worse than

436
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,220
that our components are primitive of our

437
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,260
simulator or our components or the

438
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,630
models are only available the moment

439
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,130
some of them are only available in to

440
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,679
cooks so if you want to run that into a

441
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,200
spice like you have to first move it the

442
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,529
components to a spice engine so it's is

443
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,700
the dough problem is not only the

444
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,200
netlist description but also the

445
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,630
availability of the underlying models

446
00:21:51,630 --> 00:22:04,080
that are not there soon so for the yeah

447
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,299
the question is if you can use vendor

448
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,970
models and that depends if you can

449
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,120
import spice descriptions sometimes you

450
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,529
can translate into the beauty in

451
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,200
components of cukes then it works but as

452
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
long as you have more complicated spice

453
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,090
descriptions like those poly some poly

454
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,789
functions there we don't have the

455
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,980
conversion built in so that will not

456
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,230
work so for simple models yes

457
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,040
the question is if we have a schedule

458
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,100
for removing the Qt q3 support no

459
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,980
because we work on our free time so the

460
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,270
release is ready when it's ready not for

461
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,010
the next release the next release is a

462
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,200
short one it's mostly for merging this

463
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,330
RF features that unrest needs for his

464
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,850
work so maybe for the next release but

465
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,800
we have a I have a experimental branch

466
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,610
where most of this cutie cute three

467
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,710
things are removed but there that they

468
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,450
did work they need work they need fun

469
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:19,640
functioning so maybe one year can you a

470
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,560
bit question so the question is what are

471
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,570
the tools for RF and microwave that are

472
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,620
going to be introduced on the next

473
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,710
release I don't know them all but I know

474
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,520
that there is a tempered waveguide there

475
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
is a circular transmission line

476
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,780
cylindrical transmission line there are

477
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,300
mostly new components there are no new

478
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,340
tools so to say but the new components

479
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,600
that are going to be integrated

480
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,000
so the question is about the micro

481
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,770
scripts what would take it to make a

482
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,560
transient signal integrity simulation

483
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,310
like most of the RF components they are

484
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,940
only defined in in frequency domain so

485
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,010
you would have to have some way of

486
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,660
converting that back to time domain so

487
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:38,240
that's not there so the question if you

488
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,460
extract permits from the board if you do

489
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,680
as parameter extraction you could do

490
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,690
signal integrity analysis for instance

491
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,360
you could do if you want an Ally's ever

492
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,370
evaluate this unit rugged integrity at

493
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,620
the pins of your chip and you do the

494
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,750
extraction of that you get as parameter

495
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,290
or yeah then you can do signal integrity

496
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,720
on that I saw people from used to be

497
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,280
doing that just that when we mark yet we

498
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,160
had a request to increase the number of

499
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,250
ports on the SP files that we could

500
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,080
handle just to run this kind of

501
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,620
simulation on on these multi pin chips

502
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:36,470
that that they're out there so the

503
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,460
question is why invest time in Chuck's

504
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,340
stead of using SPICE note that spice is

505
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,180
the engine right so we have there is a

506
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,250
divide between the schematic entry and

507
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,930
the engine right so yeah if you want to

508
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,640
really that's also problem for me I

509
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,830
don't want to be in this black hole

510
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,690
where you dumped your schematics your

511
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,460
knowledge your IP and you cannot cut out

512
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,300
anywhere sorry so at the moment we are

513
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,030
working together to to have this in to

514
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,430
be able to port one schematic to one one

515
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,440
project or another as it should be right

516
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,200
but what can I say if you if you need

517
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,480
the tools that we have maybe other tools

518
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
don't have it like the modeling

519
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,310
capabilities that we have we for

520
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,470
research it's interesting so as a

521
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,660
hobbyist that you need to get the models

522
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,670
from the internet maybe not it is not

523
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,410
the best use case but

524
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:52,340
