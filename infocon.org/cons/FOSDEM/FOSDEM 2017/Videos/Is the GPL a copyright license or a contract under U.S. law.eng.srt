1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,090
how's everyone doing I'm max Hills I'm

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,920
the lead attorney in the open source

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,009
programs office for Google and basically

4
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:18,259
we're writing a book an open source case

5
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,060
book so it's open source because it's

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,800
about open source but we're also

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,619
soliciting help from any attorneys or

8
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,910
anyone knowledgeable to help us do the

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,119
research we've got a lot of interesting

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,160
topics that I'm going to talk about but

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,530
I want to focus this presentation on a

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,040
chapter that we just finished on whether

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,570
an open source license whether the

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,690
violation of an open source license is

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,250
contract breach or copyright

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,269
infringement before I get into it here

17
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:48,799
are all the standard warnings I am a

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,790
licensed attorney

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm not your attorney this presentation

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,350
is not legal advice and anything I'm

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,379
gonna say they're my views my opinions

22
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,720
not Google's so please don't write a

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,600
blog post about this saying that this is

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,570
Google's opinion okay so a little bit

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,380
about my background I take open-source

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,479
more transactionally although the more I

27
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,280
interact with it the more I kind of just

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,369
by osmosis adopt the free software

29
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,770
Zella tree I think so from a

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,020
transactional background I have to deal

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,420
with open source every day and I have to

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,740
deal with it with every subsidiary

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,780
company so we're buying open source

34
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,060
we're selling it we're making it we're

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,609
modifying it we're leasing it from

36
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:34,520
people we're distributing it and we're

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,840
distributing it in physical devices

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,060
we're distributing it as part of cloud

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,950
software so basically open source

40
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,079
touches every single piece of business

41
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,689
that Google's engaged in now and my

42
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,340
efforts don't scale anymore

43
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,889
basically we have attorneys to come to

44
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,719
me every day saying I have this little

45
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,549
open source issue and a contract can you

46
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,499
please review it I have this open source

47
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,299
issue and an acquisition can you please

48
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,149
review it and this is the main problem

49
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,340
that I face I don't care why

50
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,258
just give me the answer just tell me

51
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,260
what I need to do and that's fine like

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,720
at a smaller scale I can just say do

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,430
this do that do this do that

54
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,319
but what I find is

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,390
it's really weird but there's just not a

56
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,640
lot of legal analysis that goes into

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,040
open-source counseling there's tooling

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
analysis there's definitely the idea

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,810
that you want to do the right thing and

60
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,930
I think doing the right thing if that's

61
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,430
all you do and you have no legal

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,840
background that's an excellent way to

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,390
start doing open-source compliance just

64
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,250
give people the respect they ask for and

65
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,720
try to abide it as closely as possible

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,140
with the terms of the license but that's

67
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,760
not good enough for me

68
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,099
because I want to actually dig I'll

69
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,170
actually want to dig deeper and figure

70
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,840
out why things are the case not only

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,260
that but I say right here it's okay to

72
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,569
disagree about what licenses mean but we

73
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,040
shouldn't be disagreeing on what the

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,019
case law is right we shouldn't be

75
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,760
disagreeing on what the basic facts are

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,030
so hopefully with this open source case

77
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,220
book we're gonna publish a few chapters

78
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,620
and then solicit your help Richard I'm

79
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,849
looking at you if you want to want to

80
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,569
help out I just want to have us and

81
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,220
Karen as well obviously I just want to

82
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,930
have us all have the same discussion

83
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,970
basically so with that said here are

84
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,609
some chapters this is the one I'm going

85
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,169
to be talking about today whether an

86
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,910
open-source license is a copyright or a

87
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,440
contract but there's a lot of cool stuff

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,989
we're going to talk about revoke ability

89
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,889
of licenses implied patent licenses this

90
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,900
is super interesting and annoying and

91
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,269
scary for a big corporation is a

92
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,169
contributor an employee I'm not going to

93
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,459
answer that today and hopefully I'll

94
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,730
never have to answer that

95
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,019
also trademarks really don't get

96
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,629
addressed so hopefully at the end of the

97
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,459
day this is gonna be presented in

98
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,199
casebook format so it's not going to be

99
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,970
another open source book telling you

100
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,159
what to do giving you advice because I'm

101
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,099
really sick of doing that I I used to

102
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,449
like it when I started because it gave

103
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,940
me a sense of power but now it's just

104
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,829
incredibly exhausting to keep telling

105
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,449
people what the truth is what I want

106
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,250
instead is to kind of like work together

107
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,099
to share the same way to think about the

108
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,829
problems so I want to pose the cases and

109
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,329
the questions in a real case book format

110
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,280
okay so this is what I'm gonna go over

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,580
today I'm gonna go over to cases

112
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,860
Jacobson V Katz er and mdy industries

113
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,409
versus Blizzard ver SATA is super

114
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:32,160
important here too but I

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
want to keep this brief because I want

116
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
to interact with everyone so if we have

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,410
time I won't get to Brasada at the end

118
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,850
we're gonna be talking about contract

119
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,530
damages versus copyright infringement

120
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,650
two images and if that doesn't like make

121
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,120
your blood start pumping it should

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,830
because those two things are extremely

123
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,490
different if an open-source license is

124
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,590
just a contract between the license or

125
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,650
and the licensee then breach of that

126
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,870
contract you're only entitled to what's

127
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,120
called substitute performance basically

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,610
you can't get a lot of money you can't

129
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,590
get a really good injunction it's a

130
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,590
really crappy copyright enforcement

131
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,690
mechanism if all you can do is contract

132
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,270
remedies but if you can see copyright

133
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,430
remedies oh you can get statutory

134
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,370
damages and fringes profits you can have

135
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,840
an injunction on everything that's being

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,230
distributed so for the current ways that

137
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,760
copyrights enforced and open source

138
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,620
licenses are enforced it's really two

139
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,390
people's benefit to try to always make a

140
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,390
copyright infringement claim we're gonna

141
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,320
focus on the difference between

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,780
conditions and covenants and this idea

143
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,630
of nexus to an enumerated right of

144
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,850
copyright the only background I'll give

145
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,640
you here is let's focus on three things

146
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,890
the right to make copies the right to

147
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,590
redistribute copies and the right to

148
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,850
make derivative work so those are the

149
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,020
three things we're gonna keep in mind

150
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,330
when we say enumerated right of

151
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,190
copyright and in a casebook format I

152
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,750
might just stop the presentation and ask

153
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,730
for volunteers to to talk about it

154
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,080
because what I really want to do is

155
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,030
leaving you understanding what

156
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,180
conditions and covenants are and I want

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,320
you to start applying all these

158
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,790
different tests to open source licenses

159
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,050
so we kind of examine these things

160
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,440
little more critically

161
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,690
so here the ground rules from Sun

162
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,390
Microsystems be Microsoft generally a

163
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,010
copyright owner who grants a

164
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,950
non-exclusive license to use copyrighted

165
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,220
material waives is right to sue the

166
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,310
licensee for copyright infringement how

167
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,710
about that that's a really weird ground

168
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,760
rule it's not something you'd expect

169
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,620
right there it says the moment you gave

170
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,590
a license your ability to have any

171
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,400
claims and copyright are killed except

172
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,789
if a license is limited in scope and the

173
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,060
licensee act out

174
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,040
acts outside the scope then you can

175
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,540
bring an action for copyright

176
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,919
infringement so you can think of an

177
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,350
open-source licenses this box right and

178
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,960
if it's not exclusive which means you

179
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
reserve the right to give this license

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,580
to other people then any activity the

181
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,740
person does can't sue him for copyright

182
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,780
infringement and unless somehow this box

183
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,760
was like cabined by specific language

184
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,100
and they violated that but we'll get

185
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,790
into that right now

186
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,919
so Jacobson V cancer who's heard of

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,550
Jacobsen be cancer okay so that's good

188
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,560
that's a that's a positive step let's

189
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,210
actually talk about the holding there

190
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,060
and see if we can apply it so there was

191
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,919
this Jacobsen was a model railroad

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,050
enthusiast and he made this open source

193
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,210
library as part of J MRI that was the

194
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,750
name of his consortium to control model

195
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,360
trains and he license it under the

196
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,570
artistic license so this person so an

197
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,130
employee of a company named cat sir

198
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,280
downloads Jacobson's files incorporates

199
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,900
that into their product I think it's

200
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,280
like I think it was called the railroad

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,169
commander and that they distribute it

202
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,950
without giving credit or without any of

203
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,630
the requirements of the artistic license

204
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,350
including upstreaming modifications

205
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,600
procedural history super complex super

206
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,270
weird it ended up in the Federal Circuit

207
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,729
which a copyright action shouldn't end

208
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,680
up in the Federal Circuit but this one

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,820
did because there was a patent issue

210
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,650
Federal Circuit had subject matter

211
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,520
jurisdiction and got a bite at the

212
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,870
copyright question so this is where we

213
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,990
get the holding right here whether a

214
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,789
breach of licenses copyright

215
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,350
infringement depends on whether the

216
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,930
provision breached is a condition of the

217
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,050
license or a covenant now I've read this

218
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,080
multiple times and I had a lot of

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,208
difficulty figuring out what a covenant

220
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,890
was and what a condition is so let's

221
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,700
talk about that a covenant is a promise

222
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,339
okay so a contract is mutual promises to

223
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,330
mu-2 to mutual promises between people a

224
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,860
condition uses the word if as long as

225
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,269
okay

226
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,019
the court says here that the artistic

227
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,089
license creates conditions to protect

228
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,749
economic rights so but this is a really

229
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,369
weird portion because I think a lot of

230
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,230
times people just focus on the

231
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,850
conditions versus Covenants issue and

232
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,709
they don't go into how much the court

233
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,050
found a fundamental need to connect this

234
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,879
to some kind of economic right of

235
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,089
copyright so basically if I say you can

236
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,720
use my software and please promise to

237
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,589
redistribute it

238
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,519
that's a covenant okay if you don't do

239
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,119
that I can only get you for contract

240
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,949
breach I can't really enforce it in an

241
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,199
aggressive way against you however if I

242
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,449
say here's my software you can make

243
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,809
derivative works you can redistribute it

244
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,860
only as long as you do these things then

245
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,170
that's a condition if I condition the

246
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,720
grant of rights then I can get at you

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,970
because if you violate that condition

248
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,800
you're outside the scope of the license

249
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,179
and then that's a real enforcement hook

250
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,220
but I'm just gonna highlight this

251
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,069
because again it's lost the court didn't

252
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,600
just say that

253
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,670
it's about conditions like because then

254
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,199
every open-source license would just be

255
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,379
if if if if like you could just litter

256
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,899
them with conditions and then be secure

257
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,990
and the idea that you can enforce the

258
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,350
copyright remedies but it kept trying to

259
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,209
go through every single element of the

260
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,279
artistic license and tying each

261
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,619
condition somehow to a fundamental

262
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:24,549
economic right just keep that in the

263
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:25,529
back of your head

264
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,499
all right so I talked about this

265
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,410
covenants versus conditions this comes

266
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,329
back in a later case is anyone familiar

267
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,799
with mdy v bludgeon oh okay anyone else

268
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,839
okay just to cut much less than Jacobsen

269
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,149
and this is kind of what's upsetting as

270
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,790
an open-source lawyer is just well

271
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,439
that's not upsetting it's it's an

272
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,499
opportunity people know one or two cases

273
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,790
they haven't read them in a long time

274
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,490
and then that's the end of it but the

275
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,959
idea with an open source case book is

276
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,519
it's constantly updated always

277
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,299
reflecting the most recent law so mdy

278
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,889
bris blizzards a really interesting case

279
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,339
has anyone ever played World of Warcraft

280
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,660
okay so more people have played World of

281
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,310
Warcraft then no that's good that's

282
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,920
expected

283
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,240
apparently it's a real pet I used to

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,470
play Ultima Online but I never played

285
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,480
World of Warcraft but I know from mmo's

286
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,290
it's a real pain to level up a beginning

287
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,149
character so mdy makes these BOTS

288
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,470
I'm sure you've all used these BOTS or

289
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,490
at least some of you have used these

290
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,529
BOTS to just grind the character at the

291
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,720
beginning so their level goes up

292
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,640
Blizzard hated this because they thought

293
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,140
it was reducing the value of the game I

294
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,700
mean they structured it in a very

295
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,240
specific way they sued mdy for

296
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,820
contributory copyright infringement now

297
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,220
I don't want to get into the weeds too

298
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,380
much but you can only find contributory

299
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,350
copyright infringement if the person who

300
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,209
did the thing is guilty of direct

301
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,209
copyright infringement so the question

302
00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:00,370
is alright if you run a robot to grind

303
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,959
some World of Warcraft levels and you

304
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,920
violate the terms of the EULA are you

305
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,250
committing copyright infringement it's a

306
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,529
weird question the court was the court

307
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,880
said absolutely not

308
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,060
no so here we have the whole thing from

309
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,160
mdy the potential for infringement

310
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,920
exists only when the action of the

311
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,560
licensee exceeds the licenses scope but

312
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,470
then really zoom in on here in a manner

313
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,279
that implicates one of the licence ORS

314
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,890
exclusive rights of copyright for a

315
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,690
licensees violation to be infringement

316
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,329
there has to be this nexus between the

317
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,360
condition and one of the licence or is

318
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,720
exclusive rights so even if you make the

319
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,850
argument that Blizzard didn't sell World

320
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,399
of Warcraft but merely licensed it to

321
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,140
people Blizzard has a copyright right to

322
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,459
grant people a license to copy the

323
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,529
software to make derivative works of the

324
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,600
software but nowhere in any copyright

325
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,269
law does it say you can't use BOTS

326
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,769
so the court found that that failure of

327
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,019
that condition meant you couldn't sue

328
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,640
players for copyright infringement here

329
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,060
I think I'm okay on time so I'll just

330
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,170
add another wrinkle to this before we go

331
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,940
into discussion like opened

332
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,040
with the audience so Ameriprise verse

333
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,170
facade ah it's a very recent case in the

334
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,520
Western District of Texas it's a really

335
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,250
cool case but it kind of deals with this

336
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,430
at a slightly different angle so there's

337
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,010
this idea in United States federal law

338
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,620
called preemption it says if you have a

339
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,630
state law claim and a federal law claim

340
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,610
the federal law claim may preempt the

341
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,350
state law claim meaning that federal law

342
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,620
trumps state law so the question there

343
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,730
is is an open source license a contract

344
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,170
or is it does it sound in copyright and

345
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,340
you got to go read verse on it because

346
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,990
it's a fundamental reading if you're if

347
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,900
you're into this sort of thing but it

348
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,460
held that for the purposes of preemption

349
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,250
the GPL was not preempted by copyright

350
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,450
so all that means is that you might be

351
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,060
able to sue over the GPL and copyright

352
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,030
but you can't just go automatically say

353
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,530
that there's only copyright issues at

354
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,450
issue in the GPL and the reason for that

355
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,150
kind of lines up with the tests and mdy

356
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,270
and the test and Jacobsen it lines up

357
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,190
because it says okay first of all

358
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,050
there's preemption if the thing you're

359
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,390
talking about is a copyright right but

360
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,070
also they have this thing called like a

361
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,860
next element tester or a supplemental

362
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,280
element test the court held in versado

363
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
the GPL has something extra something

364
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,830
extra that we don't like because it's

365
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,810
this extra thing that's supplementary to

366
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,370
copyright that means that we can't just

367
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,130
say it's preempted okay so that said

368
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,510
let's talk about this let's analyze some

369
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,060
some common open source licenses with

370
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,070
this lens with this with this Jacobsen

371
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,410
test and this mdy test so first of all

372
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,870
MIT right here

373
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,320
subject to the following conditions so

374
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,820
the court in Jacobsen was really

375
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,560
persuaded by using the word conditions

376
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,290
we know immediately that that is going

377
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,650
to really get them going what what do

378
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,630
people think is this

379
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,610
a covenant or a condition does it yeah

380
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,700
I'm just opening it up so the above

381
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,500
copyright notice and this permission

382
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,660
notice shall be included in all copies

383
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,110
of the software covenant or condition

384
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,140
the line above says subject to the

385
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,270
following conditions which to me

386
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,069
suggests it might be a condition

387
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,100
wonderful let me go back yes so well

388
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,390
that's the exact reasoning that the

389
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,340
court in Jacobsen would use they were

390
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,290
very persuaded by the word condition so

391
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,330
that's the Jacobsen test now let's spice

392
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,890
it up the mdy test is there an essential

393
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,890
nexus between this condition and the

394
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,300
license or one of the license words

395
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,930
enumerated rights of copyright that's a

396
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,340
very yeah it's a puzzle you have a

397
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,260
puzzled look on your face it's a weird

398
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,710
question so let me rephrase it we said

399
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,170
the essential rights of copyright boiled

400
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,700
down to copying being able to copy

401
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,770
something redistribute it or make

402
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,440
derivative works is this can is this

403
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,750
condition connected to one of those

404
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,200
three things

405
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
sure

406
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,769
I was gonna I was gonna take it a

407
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,390
different direction and say this is this

408
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,089
is this this example shows why mdy is

409
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,849
 which it was my husband my view

410
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,730
of mdy is its it took a ridiculously

411
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,429
simplistic view of it completely falls

412
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,500
apart under any sort of any kind of

413
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,490
under many many licenses out even not

414
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,949
counting open-source licenses so to me

415
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,130
it's kind of just a wrong decision so

416
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,540
let me address that for a second I love

417
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,710
that the concept that mdy is

418
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,420
that's extremely helpful because at

419
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,610
least we're both talking about mdy being

420
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,830
something that we have to look at and so

421
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,559
yeah I'm I might agree with you but the

422
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,900
pushback I have there is you say that

423
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,160
but I think it really tracks with

424
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,290
Jacobson actually because the essential

425
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,780
nexus to one of the enumerated rights of

426
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,710
copyright I'm persuaded I see the the

427
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,130
the analogy to an economic right like

428
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,550
the court Jacobson was right so again

429
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,730
it's all just rhetoric so and this I

430
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,260
pointed this out yesterday with a

431
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,880
Creative Commons license this is the one

432
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,800
commonalities attribution which is not a

433
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,929
which is not one of the exclusive rights

434
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,840
of copyright and yet we accept that as a

435
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,320
very valid I also I also prefer to think

436
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,300
of it not as the economic right which is

437
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,070
what Jacob said in but it's just

438
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,900
freaking consideration it's nothing more

439
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,000
difficult than consideration so then

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
then when you look at it as

441
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,090
consideration versus an economic right

442
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,220
then it's very simple yes there's

443
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,169
consideration tell me who the author is

444
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,419
that's the only thing I'm getting out of

445
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:33,950
this grant is acknowledgement of my

446
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,200
authorship and that's very significant

447
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,960
consideration so I then I guess I reject

448
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,910
both cases so so I guess in this it

449
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,460
would be a copyright excuse me a

450
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,050
contract or not a copyright license in

451
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,090
your interpretation the MIT license

452
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,800
because you're talking about its

453
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,399
copyright license

454
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,110
here I'll take what up and then I'll

455
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,730
have I mean do we want to go down the

456
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,890
fact that that I also kind of disagree

457
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,230
with this whole this world that they're

458
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,780
sort of this concept that there's a

459
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,370
license is simply is simply a form of a

460
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,680
contract I don't think a license is a

461
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,390
whole different sort of unicorn it's

462
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,480
just a unilateral license yeah so so

463
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,370
then that's nice and it's and it's a

464
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,990
copyright license it's I mean it's it's

465
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,660
a contract you get to use my copyright

466
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
in exchange for you giving me

467
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,500
attribution there is there's there's

468
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,740
consideration for both parties I just

469
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,050
don't see that and maybe I part of it is

470
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,270
I just don't see the point of sort of

471
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,820
this this copyright vs. contract

472
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,300
question altogether reject the premise

473
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,500
of the I let me keep going and I'll have

474
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,070
some I'll have some time for questions

475
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,160
just give me one sec so yeah that makes

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,490
sense

477
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,650
I don't think we should necessarily

478
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,870
divide licences from copyright I'm just

479
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,870
I'm just actually presenting the cases

480
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,160
talking about the whole things and

481
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,830
saying like no don't don't shut up

482
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,420
collaborate with me and let's yeah let

483
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,560
me hear your dissent in a casebook

484
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,630
so we can ask the same question let's go

485
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,880
to that really interesting things the

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,230
anti Tebow is a ssin provision of gplv3

487
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,300
so yes under Jacobson this is

488
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,280
conditional right because the gplv3 says

489
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,380
you can use this as long as you follow

490
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,220
these conditions but and p.m. I think I

491
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,950
know what you're gonna say here but I

492
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,450
see less of a connection to a right of

493
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,800
copyright here in fact I see no

494
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,890
connection to a right of copyright so

495
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,840
just to just to conclude and then we can

496
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,130
have a little bit more open discussion a

497
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,690
lot of license obligations can be fine

498
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,400
can be found to be merely contractual

499
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,770
under all the available cases we have on

500
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,320
the topic they don't tie directly to an

501
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,140
enumerated right of copyright they fill

502
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,960
the extra element test in versado for

503
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
preemption but I want to add maybe on a

504
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,260
more hopeful note

505
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,910
which is just dovetailing with with

506
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,370
Bradley's keynote yesterday so lawsuits

507
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,980
are a tactic right to advance free

508
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,679
software they're not the end goal where

509
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,110
most of us don't enjoy long lawsuits I

510
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,280
love lawsuits obsessed with law in

511
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,020
lawsuits but if we analyze this then

512
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,309
we're just gonna have to change our

513
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,410
tactics right because if art if the

514
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,860
tactics of free software depend on

515
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,540
making colleague copyright infringement

516
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,669
allegations and getting huge returns

517
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,580
like like McCarty is kind of trolling

518
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,780
then that might need to be changed but

519
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,150
if the point is and I say this at the

520
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,840
end the point is really get community

521
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,940
norms and pressure and other alternative

522
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,559
regimes besides just copyright

523
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,000
infringement lawsuits like if you're not

524
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,350
just trying to make millions and

525
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,059
millions of dollars there's a lot of

526
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,260
ways to achieve the goals of free

527
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,059
software but at least I want to situate

528
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,610
the tactics we use an actual case law so

529
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,370
so that's it and you can email me at X

530
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,840
a.m. at Google comm if you want to

531
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,340
participate in the case book and I have

532
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,610
a couple minutes so yeah some questions

533
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,360
I really like your idea of having an

534
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,600
open case book it gives me a sense that

535
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,390
even though I'm not a lawyer maybe it's

536
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,190
a legal geek I could participate in some

537
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,799
way or if the very least learn more

538
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,380
about the findings and the understanding

539
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,179
and then of course I really like what

540
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,299
Pam did and it made me think could this

541
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:40,380
would this do you want this to be a

542
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,650
collaborative place for us to share that

543
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,410
kind of dissent and yes in discussion

544
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,950
yes absolutely and power to I should say

545
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,690
I should have given credit so Dashiell

546
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,040
Renault is my colleague in the up at

547
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,450
source programs office it's a brilliant

548
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,750
attorney we argue constantly and that

549
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,850
that argument has formed the substance

550
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,910
of the case book the way that's

551
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,770
presented yes we're gonna invite lawyers

552
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,210
but we're also going to invite just any

553
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,660
geeks that want to contribute so the

554
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,309
format is just going to be case excerpts

555
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,160
and then discussion case excerpts and

556
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,200
discussion so there's not going to be

557
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,230
any real conclusions except summarizing

558
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,549
the holdings of cases so everyone's

559
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:21,910
welcome

560
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,800
to submit cases that think are relevant

561
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,630
for the particular portions and if you

562
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,220
have a descent that'll just go in the

563
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,290
discussion because the point is to have

564
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,330
a unified document that kind of trains

565
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,060
up everyone's mind and and we want them

566
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,770
to see the world the way we have learned

567
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,100
to see it over time yeah so I get the

568
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,720
impression this is gonna be focused very

569
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,270
much on US law is that right ah great

570
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,820
great so I just wanted to follow up on

571
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,950
that now I'm not a lawyer I'm an

572
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,980
occasional litigant with some success in

573
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,510
UK law there's a thing called the

574
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,810
contracts rights of third parties Act

575
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,700
which is kind of interesting if you read

576
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,010
the GPL with that act in mind and you

577
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,740
think the GPL is a contract and not just

578
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,320
a license it's possible that end-users

579
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,080
might have the right to sue for

580
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,960
compliance and nobody I mean nobody that

581
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,770
I know who's like being seriously

582
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,020
involved in GPL enforcement is familiar

583
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,790
enough as far as I can tell with UK law

584
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,920
to even have properly considered whether

585
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,960
that's true or not yeah that's a

586
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,040
fascinating point I think there would be

587
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,360
a privity analysis that'd be a little

588
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,850
bit weird but yeah you mind if I respond

589
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,650
to that please directly I'm in English

590
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:51,160
yeah yeah yeah no I'm an English lawyer

591
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,770
and I think it's a really good point but

592
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,420
I think it's possible to analyze the GPL

593
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,330
as purely being a bare license in which

594
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,620
case of contract rights of third parties

595
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,440
Act doesn't apply and the reasoning

596
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,970
behind that is equivalent to the

597
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,200
reasoning in a case called Robin around

598
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,550
classic ethane which I don't have enough

599
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,260
time to explain to anyone so if you want

600
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,850
to talk to me about it later happy to

601
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,550
have a chat with you yeah so we're gonna

602
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,530
start with the focus on American law

603
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,640
just because we want to get the thing

604
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,740
off the ground but I definitely want to

605
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,420
tackle European specific issues like

606
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,140
moral rights

607
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,620
so one when a US copyright attorney open

608
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,820
source attorney hears moral rights that

609
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,840
just like put their fingers in their

610
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,920
ears this is the last question I think

611
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,220
your your initiative for this open case

612
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,590
book is is is really awesome

613
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,730
what about extending that to discussions

614
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,029
on the text of the licenses I'm so I'm

615
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,940
working day and night on open source

616
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,340
software and their licensing and I work

617
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,649
a lot with lawyers which most of the

618
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,149
time even though I'm not lawyers I have

619
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:57,879
to educate on the topic having some

620
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:00,279
reference discussion on case book is

621
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,230
gonna be already something that's gonna

622
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,120
make their life much much easier on my

623
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,190
life much easier having the same kind of

624
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,049
discussion on the common open-source

625
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,929
licenses which are scatter on would be a

626
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:12,460
great great great thing to do I think

627
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,619
right so let me address that

628
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,210
specifically because I disagree with you

629
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,710
a little bit because I think there's

630
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,690
already an abundance of everyone

631
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,429
sounding off on what they think an

632
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:23,889
open-source license means lawyer or not

633
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:26,679
lawyer I think what we act what we

634
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,840
really need though is to agree and

635
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,600
discuss the cases and to just get the

636
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,789
questions flowing so that we can

637
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,139
actually see what the state of the law

638
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:36,850
is so if there were to be a discussion

639
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,700
of open-source licenses we do it in such

640
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,009
a way that they'd be grounded in the

641
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,019
particular case and the particular thing

642
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,789
so what I don't want to have is more

643
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:48,190
facts that people start citing to say

644
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,539
this is what it means this is what it

645
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,399
means I'm not I want people to think

646
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,799
instead of to provide them conclusion so

647
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,480
that they can short-circuit actually

648
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,350
thinking about the issues

649
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:04,570
you
