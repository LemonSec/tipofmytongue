1
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,210
right

2
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,689
[Music]

3
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,560
it's always always sequencing

4
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:39,800
oh we're already late 15

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,969
yeah so okay everyone we're running a

6
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,860
bit late because the last talk was a bit

7
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,270
over time grab a seat and welcome our

8
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,630
next speaker

9
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,639
[Applause]

10
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,679
[Music]

11
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:52,170
that's bad because they can ah hello is

12
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,710
that working

13
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,320
yeah cool yeah I'll be fine

14
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,790
okay hi I'm Nathan Hughes I'm an

15
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,050
undergraduate student

16
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,470
Aberystwyth University and I'm currently

17
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,900
on an industrial placement at the MPP C

18
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,570
which is the national plan phenomics

19
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,300
Center in Wales and this is a project

20
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,380
I've been working on

21
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,600
it's a open gravimetric phenotyping

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,830
system which essentially is an automatic

23
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,660
system that water plants and make sure

24
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,670
they don't die so yeah like I said it's

25
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,160
an automated system it records biomass

26
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,340
growth and water usage in plants it

27
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,730
records out theater automatically into a

28
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,910
MySQL database and it has the capacity

29
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,830
to augment with loads of other cool

30
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,080
sensors and that sort of thing like

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
temperature sensors salinity sensors

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,190
that sort of thing so one of the cool

33
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,450
things I'm working on at the minute with

34
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,230
it is automatically putting your data

35
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,180
into a usable form so that the end user

36
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,890
can you know see what's going on this

37
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,190
graph over on the right is water usage

38
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,590
for a plant for the last 10 or so days

39
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,170
and it's really handy because it you can

40
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,750
see on day 4 I turned off the watering

41
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,700
tap and this let me know because I could

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,720
see oh there's a there's something

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,950
missing yeah this is the web interface

44
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,620
for everything that lets you change

45
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,090
details on plants that are on your

46
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,660
system and yeah it's it's all written in

47
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,270
Python using web Pi so the system as a

48
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,150
whole is controlled with a whole network

49
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,550
of raspberry PI's our pictures haven't

50
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,190
come through great but so in it this one

51
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,140
here in the left you have a master PI

52
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,169
which network quotes a lot of PI nodes

53
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,740
and SSH is into them and you know gives

54
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,740
hardware instructions of what today all

55
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,210
of the control software is all written

56
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,840
in Python

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,630
but the low-level hardware controls all

58
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,040
done in pure C and I think the big

59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,389
question is why would you want a system

60
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,210
like this if you want to keep plants

61
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,090
alive is the big thing if you wanted to

62
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,460
do any sort of research on plants and

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,100
create data which is very accurate and

64
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
you don't want to stand there 24/7

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,860
recording things by hand so yeah people

66
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,750
also the thing you want to automated

67
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,780
system because people make mistakes and

68
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,030
so there's sort of computers but they

69
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,200
make satellites mistakes

70
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,610
yep

71
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,680
oh no oh so you don't want to be there

72
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,870
at 3:00 in the morning writing down

73
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,830
plant Reagan's so some of you might know

74
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,020
you can get automated systems commercial

75
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,060
systems that already do this and do it

76
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,870
supposedly well so why would you not

77
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,320
just buy one of these systems like why

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,200
am i working on this project right and I

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,110
just you know use a commercial system

80
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,430
and the reason is there's loads of lots

81
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,830
of problems with them I'm not gonna name

82
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,320
names or point fingers but they're very

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,870
very very proprietary and that makes me

84
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,030
very sad so yeah all of the these

85
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,030
commercial systems are generally yet

86
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,500
although all the hardware's closed and

87
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,820
all the software's closed so we don't

88
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,620
know exactly what is going on with the

89
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,729
data that's going through the system

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,090
yeah and they're not and they're not

91
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,889
adaptable are systems very adaptable you

92
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,419
can add on any sensors you want you can

93
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,510
get more data out of it especially if

94
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,560
you're working on a sort of scientific

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
environment what you want to study today

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
might not be what you want to study next

97
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,690
week and you don't want to have to spend

98
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,450
a few hundred thousand euros to change

99
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,960
that and also whenever parts break

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,520
they're all proprietary parts that are

101
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,950
all extremely expensive whereas what

102
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,960
we've done is very generic parts and

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,919
easy to replace and modify the other

104
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,039
reason these proprietary systems terrify

105
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,800
me is some of them will actually take

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,650
data that you Jenner

107
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,930
and they will send them off to their

108
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,760
remote server server to store them and

109
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,500
then you don't already know what happens

110
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,080
so I creates all sorts of problems of

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,550
yes from the simple eyes of your

112
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,110
internet connection cuts eye you can't

113
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,970
access your data that was created in

114
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,360
your green house because I don't know

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,910
why they do this it's a bit silly really

116
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,690
I don't know so the reason I don't like

117
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,580
my not knowing what's happening to the

118
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,919
deer and we're generating is because of

119
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,560
this graph and anyone who knows me will

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,229
know I love to show this graph off this

121
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,520
is a load cell so a scale with constant

122
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,350
weight spit on it so two kilogram one

123
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,630
kilogram weights and you can see over

124
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,850
time there's a load of fluctuations

125
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,479
because hardware isn't very good reading

126
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,389
data for a long time really there's lots

127
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,990
of noise and the problem is on these

128
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,780
commercial privatized systems you get

129
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,870
straight lines back no what sort of

130
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,580
averaging algorithm they're using and

131
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,430
what sort of a sanity sanitization of

132
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,740
your data they're doing which is kind of

133
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,389
scary because then if you're using this

134
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,330
for scientific research you don't

135
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,010
actually know what's happened to your

136
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,380
data in this process so that's that's

137
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,390
why we've made this system with made it

138
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,549
really open so that you have full

139
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,990
control over your theater and anything

140
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,669
you're doing with it and there's

141
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,370
complete transparency on any sort of

142
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,599
average and we're doing any sort of

143
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,850
science sanitization we're doing of

144
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,779
theater and yeah so what made everything

145
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,180
open from specifications when we used

146
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,800
for hardware to the software we've

147
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,540
written and I zoomed right through this

148
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,580
talk super fast I'm really sorry so I'd

149
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,630
like to say thanks for listening to me

150
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,150
thanks to our University for having me

151
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,839
and thanks a lot of people at the MPP

152
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,100
c4l members you may produce all of this

153
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,640
work and the SRC for funding it and as I

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,200
say all the source codes all on github

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,810
with a minute feel free to have a look

156
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,200
and yeah there's any problems let me

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,580
know because I've quite like to find

158
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:35,230
some bugs in it any questions I'm coming

159
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,590
with the mic

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,870
hello do you are you using any sort of

161
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,350
well-defined data formats for exchanging

162
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,020
for sending the data round system so for

163
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,180
example is is there a common format that

164
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,620
would already exists for communicating

165
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,080
data about plants and moisture and

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,400
things like that they are using ice

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,070
everything sort of new and different yes

168
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,250
and no I know there's quite a lot of I

169
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,589
think it's isotope formats are trying to

170
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,460
keep data organized in and a few things

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,800
like I I'm not 100 percent from that

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
there's yeah I know they're trying to

173
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,010
but it's very unorganized at the minute

174
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,470
hi I you said that the proprietary

175
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,150
solutions are very expensive I'm just

176
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,480
curious

177
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
the set of that you've got going at home

178
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,040
how much did you totally spend on it how

179
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,350
much have we spent on it well there's

180
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,410
been a couple of iterations of it but I

181
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,660
would say you're talking a tenth of what

182
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,270
a commercial system would be so whereas

183
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,620
a commercial system you might have spent

184
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,310
upwards of a few hundred thousand euros

185
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,750
our systems definitely well under a

186
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,970
hundred thousand probably quite a lot

187
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,190
under I couldn't give you an accurate

188
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,070
number unfortunately which sensors are

189
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,420
at the moment deployed in your

190
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,290
greenhouse what sensors in the

191
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,970
greenhouse there's a lot of sensors so

192
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,440
we'll have air humidity air temperature

193
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,570
those sorts of sensors in gravimetric

194
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,510
sits elf the in its pure form all we

195
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,760
have is a feet we have load cells and

196
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,080
yeah it's pretty much as we're focused

197
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,779
on for sensor at the minute but there's

198
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,870
a lot of capacity to add an augment more

199
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,220
on depending on what they expand

200
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,800
experiment will want to find out really

201
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,089
low so my question is ready to the

202
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,550
previous one did you also design the

203
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,250
sensors like load cells or did you buy

204
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,870
them off the shelf know that the minute

205
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,130
they're off-the-shelf ones but we've

206
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,930
been looking into building our own to

207
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,970
try and get more accurate readings and

208
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,500
to play a bit more with what's actually

209
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,150
coming out of them because there's so

210
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,170
much variation and

211
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,170
because load cells aren't meant to be

212
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,380
left on 24/7 there's a lot of tweaking

213
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,730
you'd want to be able to do on the very

214
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,000
low end of the hardwire so like that's

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
alright github but the minute well if

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,430
some of our plans and some of the

217
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,470
research we've been doing into that into

218
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,850
the hardware side of Hollow does

219
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,269
actually work

220
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,630
me again

221
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,560
so do you have an API for this data or

222
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,750
can it only be accessed through a web

223
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,519
interface and did you think about using

224
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,339
something like graph on for example to

225
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,260
so you don't actually have to write the

226
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,610
plotting and website so you just

227
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,510
bothered about data collection

228
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,600
I think your mic just stopped working so

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,220
I don't know what happened it's awful

230
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,860
so maybe is mic is not working anymore

231
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,290
so if you have more questions and you

232
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,010
just meter

233
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,170
yeah meet him outside thanks a lot for

234
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,960
your talk

235
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,539
