1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,199
who

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,680
hello whatever right I have I have five

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,780
minutes to tell you about promoting your

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,910
team open source software project

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,980
University student designers okay so I'm

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,810
gonna go to this really fast if you're

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,130
any questions talk to me at the end

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,949
hello I'm buried I see an engineer I

9
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,039
used to work on systems and servers and

10
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,410
really boring stuff now I work on wheat

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,380
bags understanding users and why they do

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,470
things and so on I impact University I

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,810
study the MSC in computer-human

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,219
interaction computer interaction yes

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,000
understanding the technical and the

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,289
non-technical I knew nothing about

17
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,440
humans apart from being one that didn't

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,140
tell me very much you learn lots of

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,940
stuff you learn interaction design how

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,280
things work and how to design things

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,829
that work for users creativity I knew

22
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,300
nothing about that information

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,460
architecture most important I always

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,039
talk to you today is evaluating of

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,460
interactive systems ok so what's an

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,160
interactive system anything that's got a

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,070
computer or computing type stuff in it

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,009
what do you learn in the evaluation of

29
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:15,490
interactive systems you know usability

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,710
and expert evaluation techniques so this

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,740
is the good old fashioned but fantastic

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,780
sitting knees are down and understanding

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,549
the problems they have you give them a

34
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,799
scenario you understand the scenario by

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,570
doing user research and understanding

36
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,340
what it is the users trying to do with

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,930
this there's lots of different

38
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,110
techniques frameworks think of

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,170
methodologies ok scientific

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,000
experimentation you also learn the

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,970
evaluation methods so I'm The Associated

42
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,920
methods of data collection so it's no

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,840
point in just talking to people unless

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,820
you know what you're trying to find from

45
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,210
that and then also analyzing that data

46
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,119
so you've got lots of interviews really

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,610
rich really rich tools and artifacts to

48
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,170
tell you what people are doing not

49
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,420
necessarily with the software but how

50
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,070
they use it why they use it where they

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,300
use it these kind of things so far why

52
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,240
why am I telling you this

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,190
doing evaluations of interactive systems

54
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,270
so important they tell you and they help

55
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,450
you learn how usable a system is based

56
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,920
on the data based on the data that

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
you've gathered and also help you

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,100
identify the issues okay with the system

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,030
so what am I looking for

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,550
if you're a small established stable

61
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,020
open source project if you focused on

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,450
something that any user can use and I

63
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,580
mean any user by somebody who doesn't

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,530
have to have a lot of technical

65
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,780
knowledge or domain knowledge about the

66
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,560
thing so if you're developing seismic

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,740
data analysis for geophysicist that

68
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,960
probably might not be the project for

69
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,790
for this whole if your project who is

70
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,530
looking to learn about their users and

71
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,450
how those users use your project I want

72
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,300
to talk to you if your if your project

73
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,990
is a website maybe maybe the the website

74
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,200
of a fast project even or for example a

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,110
media player application or a document

76
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,410
editor something that anybody can use or

77
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,160
anybody would use I want to hear from

78
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,120
you so what are you committing to first

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,620
of all you're committing to providing

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,670
suggestions on what part of the system

81
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,400
you want evaluated for example yeah

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,110
we've got lots of users that come up and

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,790
they want to use our software for this

84
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,700
but actually as our software does this

85
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,550
or we've got lots of new users and then

86
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,070
they disappear where do they go why'd

87
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,820
they disappear

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,000
you're also committing to attending a

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,160
presentation a session maybe some

90
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,540
sessions absolutely possibly remotely

91
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,510
about what the student has actually done

92
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,990
with that the your project that they've

93
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,000
researched how they researched it and

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,269
the findings that they've made and also

95
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,820
you're committing to being patient okay

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,290
this is a learning experience for for

97
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,520
students

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
but also for you for your project okay

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,710
so you may need to be patient with so

100
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,590
many turtle understand how it's used and

101
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,030
why it sees and maybe as raghu said what

102
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,099
happens when I can't get the thing

103
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:44,699
installed

104
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,270
okay so there's patience needed what are

105
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,129
you getting out of it also really

106
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,379
important you're getting a free

107
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,240
usability evaluation of your software

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,310
based on wherever it is that you might

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,000
be looking for you're also getting also

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,590
promoting collaboration with designers

111
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,210
people who are in this room people who

112
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,409
are trying to get involved in your

113
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,780
project even a warm fuzzy feeling which

114
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,659
anybody might not be so important about

115
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,599
but also you're getting the possibility

116
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,460
of having a designer committing to the

117
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,050
future of your project so somebody who's

118
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,520
going to be around in six months a year

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,220
or five ten years you know learning

120
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,620
about your project learning how users

121
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,310
use it and also using it if possible so

122
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,919
if you're interested I want to talk to

123
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,050
you I'm here for most of the day from

124
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,699
I'll tell you about four o'clock

125
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,370
possibly you can email me up here you

126
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,460
can do the Twitter here and then so on

127
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,800
the open source design channel on

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
freenode and if you think this is a

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,610
silly decent talk or session just five

130
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,310
six three or four that's me that's it

131
