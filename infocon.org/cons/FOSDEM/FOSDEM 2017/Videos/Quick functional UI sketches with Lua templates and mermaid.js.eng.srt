1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
hi everyone

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,490
thank you for coming I'm Alexander

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,830
Gladish and today I will tell you about

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,360
an approach to implementing design and

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,779
clink quickly functional UI sketches

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:20,720
with Lua templates and mermaid Jas

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,359
I will tell you about the case that we

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,900
are solving some approaches to design

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,330
that that to implementation of the

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,360
design that will considered I will tell

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,850
you a little bit about the tools or

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,680
quite a bit about the tools what we are

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,129
using

14
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,390
and after conclusion I hope that there

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,229
we will be some time for questions

16
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:50,479
well I'm a programmer in my background

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,530
and the floor since 2005 I believe it's

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,850
my favorite programming language and but

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,820
alas and mainly doing management work

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,299
now

21
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:07,159
and the case and I will be talking in

22
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,439
this well talk it's a huge professional

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,289
enterprise application for civil

24
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:20,719
aviation the civil aviation the main is

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,460
really really huge

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,549
it's informatization started I believe

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,499
in 1930s and it got piled up I'd piled

28
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,539
up it and piled up and there's lots of

29
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,719
legacy that's still used so it's it's a

30
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,509
huge domain and the our task is to well

31
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,259
Rina wait so to say 20 years old Windows

32
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,999
application which which is still

33
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,389
developed still been in use but well

34
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:55,130
it's about the lifetime cycle in the

35
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,130
aviation is about 20 years or maybe 285

36
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,009
so it's time to replace it so we are

37
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,420
implementing developing modern single

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,310
page web application instead like I said

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,510
the product is huge so there's not a

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,720
single person I think anywhere

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,330
which is able to fit it in his head

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,750
alone so it's a team effort there are

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,560
technology experts which new know the

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,850
technology deeply it there are product

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,510
owners and project manager which have

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,300
the vision of the new project product

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,620
and there's a designer in design team

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,740
which well can design so the application

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,370
consists of set of screens a large set I

50
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,460
think in the end it would be about a

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,760
hundred maybe more if it would be a web

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,970
page I would say that not screens but

53
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,880
pages but right here we call it screens

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,250
and each screen can be dedicated to an

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,590
object or collection of objects or to

56
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,650
some process for example and I know the

57
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,150
list of flights and the one individual

58
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,550
flight itself to be configured in the

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,660
airline schedule and for each screen in

60
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,020
the new application we have to using the

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,470
old application as a template and the

62
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,560
world wide knowledge so to say the other

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
applications they should do this thing

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
we have to design it we have to cut the

65
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,090
screen we have to consider first the

66
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,459
concept do we need a screen how should

67
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,010
we approach it how should it work when

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,180
they have to do functional sketches and

69
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,040
sometimes for difficult screens in some

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,350
interactive studies brief ones

71
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,570
then designer has to design sketches to

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,290
look nice and be useful usable and after

73
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,940
this comes the implementation well the

74
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,160
this talk is about functional sketches

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,910
the second step what are the functional

76
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,310
sketches here's an example sorry it's in

77
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,560
Russian but it doesn't matter

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,020
the main question which the function of

79
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,169
sketch has to answer is what is on the

80
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:30,590
screen

81
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,220
how does it

82
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,010
work it doesn't have to be pretty it

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,010
doesn't have to be designed but it has

84
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,600
to show what is on the screen and well

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,570
what can you do with it so let's just

86
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,600
wandering one example and when design

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,720
sketch since main questions are already

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,450
answered answers the question how does

89
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,270
it look the designer has to make it

90
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,400
readable usable and well look nice so

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,590
this that's a functional sketch

92
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,430
that's what designer made of it doesn't

93
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,650
matter what what's shown on there if

94
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,010
anyone here is from airline industries

95
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,010
and sorry for the budget up terminology

96
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,650
but I don't want to crowd your mind save

97
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,200
it anyway my goals is first of all there

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,720
like I said a lot of screens in the

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,050
application and well you have to see the

100
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,560
flow of the screens how user can move

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,230
from one screen to another otherwise you

102
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,830
will get confused and but the main thing

103
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,390
is that I need to the functional

104
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,900
sketches themselves obviously and it

105
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,510
doesn't matter how do I make these

106
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,370
screens because they are just

107
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,979
illustration just images although those

108
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,140
screens well reviewed by the team I'm

109
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,470
basically only one person who does them

110
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,810
who implements them actually so as long

111
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,190
as there's some facilities for use which

112
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,070
lets me not to drown in small changes

113
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,250
for staff which is the same on each

114
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,790
screen for example it doesn't really

115
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,640
matter what I use to get this screen

116
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,260
done as long as they have facilities to

117
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,800
rapidly iterate on it because one screen

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,900
can be changed one illustration can be

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,050
changed maybe 50 times at four difficult

120
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,650
screens usually it's five or six

121
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,400
iterations until we get it right

122
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,460
so it has to be quick

123
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,400
well what tools to use to design those

124
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,249
functional sketches now they sell a lot

125
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,830
of tools starting from raster or vector

126
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,330
editors and to the specialized editors

127
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,870
like like balsamic but well you know I'm

128
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,289
a programmer I work best in my hands on

129
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,599
the keyboard and not touching the mouse

130
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,289
of course I can use most of those tools

131
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,129
and what I can't use I can learn to use

132
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,680
but I spent all these years to be able

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,830
to effectively work with essentially

134
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,039
such a text with code I can do that

135
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,639
quickly and I'm used to well as an

136
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,620
engineer in commercial projects to

137
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,139
getting work done first and getting the

138
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,370
work done perfectly on the second it I

139
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,949
found that for me it doesn't work this

140
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,919
way for visual tools I have to fiddle so

141
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:02,509
it looks nice so well I wanted to of

142
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,729
course it's not the first time I'm doing

143
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,240
this kind of work it's probably the

144
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,500
largest by far projects but still and

145
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,250
then I had to draw the diagram the flow

146
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,979
diagram for the screens once again I

147
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,949
dropped all the tools I used before and

148
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,800
I can't do this little tool called

149
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,899
mermaid mermaid jas here's the link it

150
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,448
always you it's not the only one to

151
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,458
which does it of course but this

152
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,089
particular tool allows you to describe

153
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,909
the diagram you want in a simple textual

154
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,440
format and then there's this little

155
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,290
visual editor which issues on line and

156
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,360
you can see your changes that you tell

157
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,410
as you type it's quite convenient so I

158
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,290
thought I would create a screen flow

159
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,490
diagram here's

160
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,400
very simple example we have a list of

161
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,190
flights and we can create a new flight

162
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:12,710
from these lists by doing some action

163
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,630
called create on the left you can see

164
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,150
the code for this diagram as you can see

165
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,460
it's trivial you declare the list you

166
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,650
declare sorry the boxes the nodes and

167
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,450
then you declare the connections the air

168
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,480
arrows between nodes well what is this

169
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,490
create usual user presses the button so

170
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,580
I tried this I try to embed the HTML

171
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,380
into the arrow label and well it worked

172
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,350
it was because were made internally

173
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,850
generates SVG with embedded HTML and it

174
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,820
renders if it's used as a command line

175
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,320
tool it renders is using the headless

176
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,170
browser the phantom GS so well pretty

177
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,540
easy I just type some HTML and I get a

178
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,540
nice button let's go further and here's

179
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,500
the list of flights in its empty States

180
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,880
the state list of flight screen it says

181
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,570
well it has header it has well there are

182
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,820
no flights message and a button to

183
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,110
create I say as I said it should not

184
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,090
look beautiful it should look functional

185
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,670
so the designer and programmers will

186
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,420
figure out what's going on the beauty of

187
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,590
design will hamper this process actually

188
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,440
and well there's a create button which

189
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,480
lists leads to the new flight form

190
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,260
here's a code for this diagram on the

191
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,490
left and well here's a new flight form

192
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,520
it's greatly simplified of course but

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,230
still there's

194
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,430
flight airline code in flight number and

195
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,100
airport codes well it's not an a port

196
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,680
it's a free Moscow airports nevermind

197
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,180
well the flight dates and you can create

198
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,959
or cancel and well both of those buttons

199
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,850
lead to list of flights

200
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,389
I assume that for most and it release

201
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,320
for most of the screens actually what

202
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,690
the button does what this or arrow means

203
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,860
is clear for from the context sometimes

204
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,360
it is not and you have to add some well

205
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,560
commentary on this but still usually it

206
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,190
works only this the screen and what the

207
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,389
buttons do if the person knows what well

208
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,420
enough about the technology it's it's

209
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,320
sufficient so on the Left there's the

210
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,269
code for this diagram as you can see

211
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:17,260
it's rather ugly but still it works and

212
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:25,190
we've got all three all - sorry kinds of

213
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,790
screens of illustrations we need the

214
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,220
screen step themselves are detailed on

215
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,649
the right on the left side and on the

216
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,500
right there's a screen flow diagram that

217
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,510
helps you navigate those screens but

218
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,449
well when you are doing HTML it's not

219
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:52,480
very convenient to use just an HTML

220
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,649
especially in this case because you

221
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,470
don't have actual browser available then

222
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,860
you well you could have it but it takes

223
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,380
some work to set up the environment so

224
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,810
right here is kind of HTML for era

225
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,839
design when you even without dynamic

226
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,440
HTML then you have only they lie layout

227
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,529
so I think in theory you could write

228
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,110
some JavaScript JavaScript here but I

229
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,129
never tried

230
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,800
instead I'm using templates templates to

231
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,959
generate my screens and here is the list

232
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,819
of flights screen this one as a separate

233
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,959
file so to say as you can see that's a

234
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,399
simplest example there's heard no

235
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,980
flights messages in button and I'm using

236
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,910
those placeholders in curly braces to

237
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,930
indicate templates as you I think most

238
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,120
of you familiar with at least one

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,079
template language so here the template

240
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,670
has arguments so that's a title template

241
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,600
which has argument the title string and

242
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,100
here is link argument which has a link

243
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,970
sorry

244
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,540
template I will call them actually not

245
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,759
templates about but helpers helpers

246
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,910
after the handlebars template template

247
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,189
engine so we have title helper and link

248
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,939
helper and link helper has one argument

249
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:43,949
is the screen name which links targets

250
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,160
to points to and then the link body

251
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,339
itself as you can see I'm not adding any

252
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,310
kind of layout here I could for example

253
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,600
move through this bold markup inside the

254
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,630
title template but since those two

255
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,470
templates to help us are so basic I

256
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,990
don't want to do this I don't want to

257
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,829
change anything because otherwise I

258
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,660
don't want to have side effects I mean

259
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,139
because otherwise it would be hard at

260
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,209
the later point to refactor this this

261
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,709
thing so all that those should say to

262
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,009
the template system is that we for this

263
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,670
bunch of template code the title is list

264
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,339
of lights and this button leads to the

265
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,130
new screens actually not button but this

266
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,220
would have a piece of text there will be

267
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,610
in the result in HTML

268
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,680
these codes results to exactly this

269
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,429
screen nothing is changed so here's the

270
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:02,550
new flight form which is exactly the

271
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,179
same we will not read it out loud so

272
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,759
like I said we have two basic helpers

273
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,559
title and link here and here here is the

274
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,579
format for those helpers like you like

275
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,329
you see the title text takes text as a

276
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,759
single argument and this argument goes

277
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,059
until the end of the argument string so

278
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,660
the this space is ignored and not

279
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,759
ignored but put into inside the argument

280
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,069
and the link here has two arguments one

281
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,189
is word as defined by the set of

282
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,769
continued set of non continuously story

283
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,709
of non space characters so this is the

284
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,679
screen and then everything to the end is

285
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:56,399
body okay so let's try to define those

286
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,670
two helpers I introduced the actually

287
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,189
that's the only I've been a single one

288
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,709
helper which has to be defined by the

289
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,480
system each is defined which let's do to

290
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,099
define the helpers define so you define

291
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,459
the helpers right in the body of your

292
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,260
templates basically and they define text

293
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,409
the symbol like the name of the helper

294
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,299
as a first argument

295
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,659
then there's a table lower

296
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:37,169
finally lower table of arguments here it

297
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,710
is and then there's the code of the

298
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,679
template what does it mean well here you

299
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,679
can see the definitions for simplest

300
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,280
possible implementation of soft title

301
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,040
linguish just leave the layout and

302
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,890
changed and don't do anything and here

303
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,770
the code is well lowest ring not the

304
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,710
cold which contains the variable name

305
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,840
the argument name from the template

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,190
right here then the title is encountered

307
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,070
it's gets replaced by the implementation

308
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,460
which I will show and the one of the

309
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,440
next slides it gets replaced with this

310
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,430
string which in turn gets replaced this

311
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,300
placeholder text gets replaced from the

312
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,160
arguments well it's obvious but okay

313
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
let's let's go next let's let's look at

314
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,510
the implementation the here's the define

315
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,020
function which basically says says here

316
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,910
string well that's all this string from

317
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:06,110
title to the end let's eat first word

318
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,480
then table then all the text there is

319
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,640
from this string and let's load lower

320
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,550
values from the argument so basically

321
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,360
the lower value function all it does it

322
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,880
appends sorry prepense

323
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,300
to this argument string the well the

324
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,180
keyboard return so it would be returned

325
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,470
this table returned this text and then

326
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,680
call slaughtering and that's it since

327
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,370
I'm only one person working with this or

328
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,120
it not person who would work with this

329
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,350
has to use the secure environment well

330
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,410
it's okay to just not do anything boxing

331
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,330
just call lost lost ringing and that's

332
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,510
it well so you load the arguments is a

333
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,490
table you load the code which may be a

334
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,580
string or a lower function code and

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
if it's string you just wrap it so it

336
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,149
will work on replacing the placeholders

337
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,460
in this string with the actual values

338
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,649
and then you define this symbol the

339
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,919
title so it will be available for future

340
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,509
replacements how does it work

341
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:37,789
the definitions here put into context

342
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:41,639
context is a type table which is which

343
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,820
holds everything with which can be

344
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,879
replaced so this text has to be in the

345
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:53,279
context of the this title invocation it

346
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,129
will be put there to this title in

347
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,779
vacation of course it would be put there

348
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,100
but by this defined quote the context

349
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,950
can be nested so the its it all works as

350
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,049
can you see this net no you remove this

351
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,559
code the continue sorry the contexts can

352
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,690
be nested so right here you're in global

353
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,870
context is it correct yes in global

354
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,750
context and inside the title there's a

355
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,850
nest that context that has the text

356
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,159
definition and then I'm not sure if I'm

357
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,039
coming through but just look at the code

358
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,210
I will have the link to the repo at the

359
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,210
end of the slides ok anyway enough of

360
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,730
this so let's define some something

361
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,389
useful

362
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:56,190
here's the title macro as a helper sorry

363
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,070
as law of implemented as a lower

364
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,620
function which gets the text argument

365
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,240
and it saves its sound there in the root

366
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,370
context and just returns it

367
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,529
well first doing some replacements in

368
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,590
case it's contains other placeholders

369
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,000
and here's a link

370
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,580
helper which well stores the link

371
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,400
between two screens and returns the body

372
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,860
of the link and the one interesting

373
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,370
thing that's include the loading the

374
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,140
template will link that so we will be

375
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,299
able to enumerate all the links there so

376
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,400
we will be able to build this screen

377
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,250
flow diagram we will have data and I

378
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,730
will get to be to that a bit later and

379
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,700
well that's it here's a house include

380
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,130
this implemented is really simple so we

381
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,650
just store the template name in the

382
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,320
context in the greatness that context

383
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,710
stole there the template name and call

384
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,110
and read this template name it's

385
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,990
actually should say template not file

386
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,250
name here and well call the replace so

387
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,740
all placeholders are replaced there and

388
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,690
that's it and so depending on how you

389
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,630
define define your title and link

390
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,020
helpers you will get several kinds of

391
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,590
diagrams from the same set of templates

392
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,490
we just end it up quite useful for me so

393
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,350
from the same set of templates I'm

394
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,080
getting the outline diagram which has

395
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,820
only screen titles and arrows and from

396
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,440
the same set of templates and getting

397
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,570
the close-up diagram which we have seen

398
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,990
earlier of the screen itself with little

399
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,289
arrows pointing to other screens and

400
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,940
also I can get a printable diagram which

401
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,380
has no arrows but only text content

402
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,640
screen content sorry well so that's

403
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,909
useful and for me this is the main

404
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:12,429
feature of this templating engine and

405
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,850
the reason actually I event implemented

406
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:23,699
it on my own so more useful helpers

407
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,580
here's a comment which does nothing and

408
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,940
just it's it's argument he is a

409
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,840
ruler HTML which I found useful two

410
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,830
separate blocks of templates and here's

411
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,149
an expression which accepts arbitrary

412
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:47,259
lower code probably with the other

413
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:52,479
placeholders embedded and well just load

414
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,210
sits and executes they standard stuff

415
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,269
from all this

416
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:02,139
okay so here's another helper leaf which

417
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:05,859
is really useful it allows me to disable

418
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:11,739
or enable parts of the sorry it's leaf

419
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:15,220
not them with this allows me to define

420
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,239
my own context for example when used in

421
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,289
conjunction with then helper which

422
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:26,739
renders the its body only then the

423
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:29,769
symbol is in the code is defined in

424
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:34,779
context I can define at the same place

425
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,379
both editable or not edit no read-only

426
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:41,309
parts of the screen its softened that

427
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,190
for this same set of data it often

428
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,799
happens that you have to show the editor

429
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,909
form which user can change or just

430
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:59,289
preview this data of some form so I

431
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,759
define this form which looks differently

432
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,129
when it's editable or not and then I

433
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,889
enable editable in the additional

434
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,739
context incentive and just invoke this

435
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,899
template and voila

436
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:19,119
I get the this line and not this line so

437
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,159
everything related to the same set of

438
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,749
data is kept together well another use

439
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:27,549
for the brief help artist is to define

440
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,749
extra context like constants to be used

441
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:37,599
inside the template here I have a simple

442
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,710
histogram drawing macro template which

443
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,520
well

444
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,130
just calculates the width of the

445
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:58,170
histogram from its arguments some stats

446
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,730
it took me two days to implement the

447
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,120
core functionality it was about 250

448
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,420
lines of code and well I'm using this

449
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,650
tool to create different screens

450
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,440
different illustrations for half of a

451
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,880
year now and the code grew up about to

452
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,530
about 300 to 30 lines of code mostly

453
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,090
additionally longhand and in Diagnostics

454
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,760
and we created about fixstick sketches

455
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,390
and finalized 60 different sketches and

456
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,310
many more to come

457
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,330
I believe was it worth it well yes it's

458
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,660
not invented here syndrome at its best

459
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,870
worst and I don't know but still I've

460
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,330
got the tool that does that I need I've

461
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,830
got I've got it really cheaply effort

462
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,450
wise and its output while not ideal is

463
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,480
quite readable and useful for the design

464
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,640
eV and from the programmers in the book

465
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,940
for the whole team and well I had much

466
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,800
fun coding it you may ask why not

467
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,160
something else it given that I spent

468
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,740
really really low amount of time working

469
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,440
on the this tool alone I think that

470
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,730
studying another two would take about

471
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,150
the same time and well but if you do

472
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,580
know another good tool which does what I

473
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,090
need please share it may be useful well

474
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,890
there are some problems in this tool

475
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,980
first of all is error diagnostic which

476
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,800
almost non-existent because I'm the only

477
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,820
user right now it gets better but since

478
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,130
most of the time I know what's up with

479
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,580
an error I just keep it it can be

480
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,700
improved then the main problem here

481
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,620
debugging the HTML output not the output

482
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,450
itself but how its rendered because

483
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,889
basically it's like it was done in

484
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,100
Internet Explorer 6 so you don't have

485
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,059
any debug console or no not you can do

486
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,519
nothing it just in an image you have to

487
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,190
just thrive this and try that and then

488
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,200
there's some issues with expressive

489
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,149
power or disk language but it's more

490
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:26,380
than enough for me right now

491
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,220
well I'm done thank you

492
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,860
questions please

493
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,279
the question is will there be any use of

494
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,880
using this tool for non HTML diagrams

495
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,630
yeah yeah sure because all I do is work

496
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,149
with text as long as the input for your

497
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,610
tool which does something called

498
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,639
something else it's text you can use it

499
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,559
actually for me the main new feature

500
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,450
here is not the template language is a

501
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,110
mermaid thing because it tells me to

502
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,159
draw those flow diagrams easily between

503
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,399
screens and as for the template language

504
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,519
I think that you probably can use

505
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,049
whatever you like

506
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,279
or this one it's the link is here

507
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,899
welcome and also patches and pull

508
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,110
requests are welcome too

509
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,529
