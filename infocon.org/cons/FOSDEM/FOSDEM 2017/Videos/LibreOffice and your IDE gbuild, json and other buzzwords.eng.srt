1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,510
[Music]

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,509
all right I'm late let's go

4
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,230
so that's me I'm working at canonical

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,340
packaging Libre Office for Ubuntu and

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,099
also I'm in the board of directors for

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,660
the document foundation and well let's

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,089
go back to 2010 because that that was

9
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,410
when the whole thing started with the

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,979
new build system you back then and I

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,460
wanted to just just have a look at what

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,170
we thought we would do back then and how

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,970
how we thought we could improve stuff

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,519
back then and what we actually achieved

15
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,449
from that so yeah that was one of the

16
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,659
original slides from the OpenOffice

17
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,840
conference in 2010 except that it didn't

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,009
have this branding but and well that was

19
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,070
the goal back then and for the most part

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:27,070
I think we achieved that but it it might

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,359
not look like that if you're building

22
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,640
Libre Office now but you have to think

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,969
about how how Open Office was building

24
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,060
at the time there were many many things

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,119
that were broken there there were manual

26
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,219
dependencies there were incomplete

27
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,979
dependencies there were incompatible

28
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,469
bills which means that you could build

29
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,159
one part and you had to know which part

30
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,319
would change if you change that and if

31
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,689
you didn't horrible things would happen

32
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:01,180
and all kinds of other issues

33
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,080
so those were the goals we had back then

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,370
actually I thought by now we would all

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,699
use 32 core machines and that didn't

36
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,240
happen by now we just use all very nifty

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,020
laptops but the other things still are

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,490
true and are things that we very much

39
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,180
profit from now and if you if you use

40
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,310
leaper office now on thing well Libre

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,470
Office is still slow

42
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,050
that was the comparison from just

43
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,750
building a few modules that was back

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,910
then and it's pretty much the same like

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,720
that now except that we almost take as

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,300
much force then that Senate run of these

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,870
modules because we run all the tests by

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,030
default all the time or lots of them so

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,440
we got a lot faster and then we added

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,830
lots of tests that you can't disable so

51
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,150
that we Dec as Louis as we were before

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,670
unless you know how to trick around that

53
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,630
but I'm not going to tell you so one

54
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,330
other goal of this was to not repeat

55
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,930
yourself

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,930
one other goal of this was to not repeat

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,200
yourself because repeating yourself

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,900
stupid and especially if you're in the

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,640
build system you have multiple things

60
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,380
that tell you how to build something

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,620
that can again be inconsistencies and

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,459
stuff that can create issues for

63
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,050
comparison this is how it is in leaper

64
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,080
office right now you register and if you

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,510
want to have a new library there you put

66
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,709
it somewhere which says in there Jassi

67
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,480
repository m'kay which essentially says

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
where it should end up in the final

69
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,540
build and well then you say how to build

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,989
it like I want to build these C++ files

71
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,230
in the old open of this world well it

72
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,340
was a bit different so

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,190
that was one of the issues we had with

74
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,649
the old stuff the other thing was Tim

75
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,839
tough TBI so there's more than one way

76
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,020
to do it and well that's always a bad

77
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,970
thing because you have to know all of

78
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,820
them to to read actually what others are

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,750
doing and again by now if you wonder for

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,520
example export a symbol and Libre Office

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,490
you do something simple like this you

82
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,410
add something

83
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,080
DLL public to the declaration and then

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,380
the symbol is exported in OpenOffice me

85
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,540
yeah you could have multiple ways to do

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,180
that and every one what would cost

87
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,770
interesting different slightly different

88
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,000
effects so again it was troublesome oops

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,490
same slide so this this was the initial

90
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,060
implementation of the back then new

91
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,060
build system we had all these targets in

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,780
one huge dependency tree and that meant

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,389
that we were aware of all the stuff that

94
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,760
was happening and in all the build we

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,800
didn't have like the horizon effects

96
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,740
where you would do an incompatible build

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,500
which meant you built something and said

98
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,570
I'm pretty sure this is binary

99
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,000
compatible with the rest and trust me

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,020
and it actually knew if it was binary

101
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,620
compatible or not and most of the stuff

102
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,020
so the core stuff of this is still like

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,490
that today a few things changed like the

104
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,310
backwards compatibility is gone we we

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,950
don't need like to deliver and copy

106
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,320
stuff five times around we needed to do

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,080
that in the old OpenOffice build system

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,030
to be compatible with the old build

109
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,729
system so thanks to all these guys who

110
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,440
helped contributing to this the

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,849
important quote here is I say we take

112
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,500
off a nuke the entire site from orbit

113
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,360
it's the only way to be sure that was

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,169
the

115
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,029
the last comment when we killed the last

116
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,139
part of the old build system so that

117
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,199
needed to be in the commit message there

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,439
so with this we had the whole build

119
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,949
system on essentially on one build

120
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,919
system and not like we had before - or

121
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,960
rather three like the old one the new

122
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,300
one and the one that mixed everything

123
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,009
between those which was some ugly pearl

124
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,710
hickory and then I got bored and I

125
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,349
wondered if I could do more than the

126
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,629
stuff that I originally planned for the

127
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,599
new build system and one of the things

128
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,810
was well actually syntax highlighting

129
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,509
and using IDs is a pretty good thing but

130
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,759
it's it's hard to like manually tell

131
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,339
your IDE where all the the include paths

132
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,669
are and things like that on the other

133
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,939
hand well we can't just say use Visual

134
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,800
Studio and then we build everything with

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,569
Visual Studio because that's kind of

136
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,919
heart of linen on Linux and on other

137
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,930
platforms so using just an ie s the main

138
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,729
build system doesn't work but what we

139
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,270
could do is have even the normal cross

140
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,060
platform build that we had before and

141
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,949
export solutions to different ideas so

142
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,979
they could be using this to give you

143
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,499
syntax highlighting debugging and stuff

144
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:04,069
like that so the first I did was care

145
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,529
develop because well seemed to be easy

146
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:12,589
to me and again as I said that was not

147
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,270
not something that was initially

148
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,830
patented was like an afterthought so

149
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,669
what it did was you didn't make and P

150
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,039
which prints alt out all the build

151
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,240
information and then it passed that and

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,679
try to build the IDE solution from that

153
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,659
turns out that something as simple as

154
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,220
make MP

155
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,559
isn't really stable over different

156
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,070
versions of make so the positive for

157
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,610
this turned to be it always added more

158
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,590
stuff and I looked at this and this is

159
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,200
not good we're taking more time to pass

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,630
actually being full then then it's

161
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,380
actually in there was always flaky

162
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,820
because people were using different

163
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,000
versions of make and it was kind of

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,980
tricky to to use this in a reliable way

165
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,700
and the goal of this was to have people

166
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,150
who were new to development to get there

167
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,210
on an IDE and well if the first thing

168
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,760
they do is is failing and they need a

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,460
full bill to get there that's the kind

170
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:30,400
of sucks so I now reorganized that and

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,280
did all the tricky stuff in the build

172
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,130
system itself and then it just dumps

173
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,120
that in Jason so that the simple Python

174
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,340
script can read that and translate that

175
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,910
to whatever ie you want to have so this

176
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,160
is the solution right now and I think it

177
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:57,350
it mostly is reliable and we can look

178
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,570
here right there was a question from

179
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,010
where's young its young here nope

180
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,800
yum asked me well I looked at the files

181
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,990
and and the the compiler switches oops

182
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,530
wrong slide that actually are given to

183
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,589
to compile a C++ file on Windows and

184
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,780
almost all the stuff all the method or

185
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,450
the data about what definitions and

186
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,030
flags and stuff ought to be used for

187
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,040
this target or in the JSON file with a

188
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,810
few exceptions and this is what he was

189
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,690
asking about and that's these few a few

190
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,750
things still missing that is like

191
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,740
generally config specific stuff like

192
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,660
which flex to use for exceptions and

193
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,730
stuff like that which is not target

194
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,050
specific so

195
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,210
when he wrote this email should they

196
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,730
have been in the Jason I said well no

197
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,850
because they are configuration specific

198
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,190
and they are the same for for the whole

199
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,110
bill but maybe we should I should just

200
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,910
drop in Jason found next to it which

201
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,240
which contains all this info so that you

202
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,570
can actually from the JSON file find out

203
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,090
all the Flex that were used to build

204
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:20,960
this on your specific platform so which

205
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,100
are the EES do we have well k develop

206
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,900
that was me in the beginning then Han

207
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,480
saw did Visual Studio and young and

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,530
others did additions to that Xcode was I

209
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,320
think initially done by Cho and then a

210
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,740
lot of work by young so we have like the

211
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,290
major platform major IDs for each

212
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,440
platform being able to to work on

213
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,760
LibreOffice code in the native native ly

214
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,990
feeling environment and we have amend

215
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,290
you completely by moggy for the old UNIX

216
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,980
guys who wouldn't use anything newer and

217
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,040
well we have to create and actually one

218
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,650
of the cue Creator guys came up to me he

219
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,870
can't attend this talk but he said well

220
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,600
I really want to help out so we we

221
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
should we should get contact with them

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,330
and get your Creator to be nicely

223
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,220
integrated with that

224
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,910
[Music]

225
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,819
so the path was what what I aim to do

226
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,749
with the original new build system eight

227
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:43,560
years ago and this RTE stuff is just

228
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,660
like a nice additional feature and that

229
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,019
were like the ideas - maybe after eight

230
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,449
years we should again use a new build

231
00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:02,699
system just cause and well I felt like

232
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,149
the old UNIX guy that said no not with

233
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,709
me but there's this thing if you work

234
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,249
too long on something that maybe maybe

235
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:19,410
you're not entirely well neutral in on

236
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,730
this so when I said well you should

237
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,269
never look at this I looked the next

238
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,399
thing I did was look actually how much

239
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,879
of this build system was actually done

240
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,100
by me and hey good news although I

241
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,769
brought the original stuff there are

242
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,439
other guys who own a lot more lines of

243
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,870
it by now than me so it's not mine

244
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,829
anymore great David Michael

245
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:48,059
congratulations

246
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,329
you own this thing now so again and also

247
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,790
the distribution of country so this is

248
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,319
the lines of code and who lost touch

249
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,439
them and it's pretty ly even distributed

250
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,819
and there are a lot of people touching

251
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:06,349
lots of areas there

252
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,510
[Music]

253
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,440
so looking forward in to using something

254
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,810
completely different

255
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,930
these were the original problems we try

256
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,360
to solve with with eight years ago when

257
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,840
we did this some of the stuff creep back

258
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,000
in I think cargo cool programming is

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,090
already in the make files is again on

260
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,280
the rise because well it's been eight

261
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,520
years and stuff collected in there but

262
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,550
in general the other stuff is mostly

263
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,380
reached and I would add one more thing

264
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,200
the tool that I that I spoke about

265
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,860
do not repeat yourself and don't do tint

266
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,370
of PDI and that's one of the main

267
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,620
arguments against something like let's

268
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,090
let's use Visual Studio directly then

269
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,670
like export that to somewhere else

270
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,760
there's more than one way to do it

271
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,089
so again I'm kind of reluctant to use

272
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,040
something like Visual Studio solutions

273
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,709
directly and then have to maintain

274
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,519
different build systems on all platforms

275
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,810
because that will always break in this

276
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,750
more than one truth to the build so

277
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,430
someone does something on Windows and

278
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,180
then he changed the solution files but

279
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,769
not the stuff for the other platforms

280
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,199
and stuff like that so that that unless

281
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
you find a way to synchronize all this

282
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:55,320
is really tricky the other challenges so

283
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,870
I think we we should stay with with

284
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,050
something that is one single build

285
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,829
system whatever that is and well the the

286
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,199
other stuff like having water generated

287
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,760
intermediates who here uses automate and

288
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:23,670
auto comes and loves it okay we got a

289
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,410
talk the other stuff is well custom

290
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,660
targets like again this is having more

291
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,269
custom stuff in in the build targets

292
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,589
which is not like the usual

293
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,040
cross-platform stuff and the degrees of

294
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,870
freedom in oh great later

295
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:11,310
right so we have way too much degrees of

296
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,990
freedom and the configuration especially

297
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,819
on Windows where there should be pretty

298
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:21,329
much only one mostly and so we that's

299
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,810
the goal again to to get away from the

300
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,450
build system and that means for example

301
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,670
well the candidates for this are

302
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,420
obviously see make or maybe use use

303
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,150
scheme in in make as a migration path

304
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,780
but the advantage there is not to

305
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,790
rewrite everything from scratch again

306
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,200
but - softly migrate to it but the the

307
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,410
most interesting issue probably is the

308
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,980
build execution because Ninja is a lot

309
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,620
faster than what we have now because

310
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,290
make is just awfully slow pausing all

311
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,300
the dependency files that we have which

312
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,290
are just huge

313
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:59,100
I mostly agree but I'm I mean I want to

314
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,679
fight against my inner in a feeling that

315
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,640
everything is fine so yeah but if I look

316
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,100
at all these if I look at all these

317
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,580
things problem injures is the first most

318
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,880
useful things of trying to attack within

319
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:26,610
these rather than the others yes so the

320
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,740
externals are actually yeah yeah

321
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,190
interesting

322
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,610
all right yeah anyone else but no but

323
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,840
having questions yes

324
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,690
generally usable bottles of their

325
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,240
project so how much liquor

326
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,000
well this it it there there is somewhere

327
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,590
deep inside is something that is

328
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,250
generally usable but you you will have

329
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,410
trouble finding it if you're not knowing

330
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,210
about Libre Office because there are

331
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,380
these things like these multiple layers

332
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,780
of where to put libraries and stuff that

333
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,400
we are actually not using that much

334
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
anymore but they are still in there I

335
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,230
think my gosh once did an experiment to

336
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,910
just get the build system out of

337
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,870
LibreOffice and then try to to get rid

338
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,750
of all the Liebherr of a specific stuff

339
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,140
so it was just one huge build system

340
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,280
that built hello world

341
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,220
yeah also there are lots of

342
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,170
optimizations that you you probably only

343
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,030
need if you're as big as LibreOffice

344
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,280
like precompiled headers and windows

345
00:20:50,280 --> 00:21:01,250
having all this parallelization and read

346
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,340
so stuff like that and having for

347
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,280
example the GCC creates the dependency

348
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,920
files those are huge that's huge to be

349
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,350
just well normally you would just use

350
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,810
all of them pass all of them and be fine

351
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,070
well that that doesn't work fully

352
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,140
profits so we are taking all these

353
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,570
dependency files and pre passing them

354
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,570
and kicking out all the stuff that is

355
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,600
actually superficial and stuff like that

356
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,040
so if your project doesn't need 20

357
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:46,560
minutes on a 32 core machine so you

358
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,130
absolutely invited to look into the sir

359
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,380
and it's luckily not only me who who

360
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,810
knows about how this stuff works which

361
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,910
is good and well feel free to to to take

362
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,850
a look at it looking forward for

363
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,600
contributions

364
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,370
yeah so again in the comparison to the

365
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,020
old build system the most important

366
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,960
thing was not even the speed that was

367
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,300
also important but more important was

368
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,820
getting rid of all the craft that wasn't

369
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,860
the old stuff that collected over 20

370
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:50,570
years yeah right the possible meaning

371
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,610
that you touched one file and says it

372
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,080
would do an incremental build and

373
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,030
actually would work because that didn't

374
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,740
work in the old OpenOffice build system

375
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,810
you would touch one file and everything

376
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,240
would be broken mostly most of the time

377
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,020
okay nothing I'm over time already yes

378
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,450
thank you

379
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:16,150
