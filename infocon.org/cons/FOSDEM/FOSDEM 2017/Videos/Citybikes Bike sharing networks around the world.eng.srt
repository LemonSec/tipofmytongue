1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,340
so if everyone gets settled this is our

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,139
next talk about city bikes please

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,799
welcome our speaker

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,630
okay thank you all for for coming

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,930
I'm with Garuda I'm a dinosaur and many

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,050
years ago well first a question called

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,000
much people how many people here know

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
about the bike sharing systems okay

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,410
that's huge so many years ago I had this

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,870
problem that there was no Android app

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,970
for the local bike sharing system in in

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,150
Barcelona so when whilst trying to

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,909
create it I found out that there was no

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,610
open date available for me to build this

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,220
app so that's what I when I learned

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,640
scraping with this basically some piece

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,930
of code that connects to a website

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,020
extracts information and you do

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
something with with this data so when I

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,060
got all this information available for

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,630
me I I created open missing which was an

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,400
Android app for the local bike sharing

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,820
system in Barcelona and when that was

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,740
already working I found that that

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,780
Barcelona was not the only city in the

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,070
world with one of these bike sharing

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,860
systems and that many other cities all

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,690
around the world had exactly the same

29
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,750
problem which is that there was no data

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,600
available for developers to create apps

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,080
or projects so instead of creating more

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,120
abs or more different cities I created

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,970
city bikes which is a bike shining

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,850
network aggregator for as many cities as

35
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,659
it can fit nowadays this thing that

36
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,730
started in Barcelona it currently

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,750
supports more than 480 cities in all the

38
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,380
world and it grown into this by by this

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,530
Python library that started the project

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,870
the good thing about these Python

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,340
libraries that people can contribute

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,299
these spiders for for their own cities

43
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,849
so let's say a developer from from Italy

44
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,920
wants to add support for some cities in

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,890
in Italy he will just contribute to buy

46
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,080
bikes which is the core part of the of

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,410
the project

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,520
and I don't have to do the work for him

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,100
I mean I don't have to code this ad he

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,380
will do it he had supports for his own

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,380
city or maybe it breaks and and he will

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:49,440
he will do it so that's that's the cool

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,230
thing about about about the whole the

54
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,140
whole project when you have an open API

55
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,900
then people can start creating many

56
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,630
things around it and this is an example

57
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,570
of many different applications that that

58
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,080
work with city bikes and then we we get

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,180
to this we get to this to this point

60
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,040
where nowadays we assume that data open

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,230
data or something it's a reality but

62
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,950
this is the the sad part of it it's that

63
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,450
more than half of it of all the

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,030
information contained in city bikes it

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,320
comes from scraping and then only 42 are

66
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,050
licensed it so actual sources and so you

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,450
probably know about open data and and

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,339
the Busse word it is many people

69
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,400
politicians City Council's they talk

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,910
about open data I think they say open

71
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,600
data

72
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,550
let's open things and and so on but

73
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,310
somehow it doesn't relate with with

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,940
what's happening here so the problem and

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,730
something I discovered it's the company

76
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,230
is running these projects they are not

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,020
they are not opening up to to to

78
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,890
developers

79
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,909
[Music]

80
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,680
and that's it and that's the main issue

81
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,280
with with these guys it's it's that for

82
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,640
instance these are the the ratings for

83
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,850
for an unofficial up for bike sharing

84
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,370
and they are terrible and and when when

85
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,700
you when you have the open API all these

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
apps have great ratings compared to to

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,590
the main project for instance this is

88
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,380
the this is the website of one of these

89
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,620
bike sharing systems and this is the

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,150
this is the map that they have on the

91
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,220
website and it's not an actual map it's

92
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,590
an image of a map and you can even click

93
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,600
on it they did that because they want

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
they want to avoid people spy during

95
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,630
this website so what what are they what

96
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,940
are they actually thinking I mean it

97
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,850
doesn't work like that so so that's

98
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,440
that's what some of these companies are

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,220
are are doing in order to avoid

100
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,419
releasing this information I think this

101
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,370
information I mean it's public transport

102
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,220
information it it should all really

103
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,430
belong to us and we should be able to to

104
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,240
participate in in these projects on on

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,250
the way that way that we like and that's

106
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,350
that's what city likes between it's been

107
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,310
trying to do so I will show some

108
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,740
examples of things this is a map of all

109
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,940
the cities that the project currently

110
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,930
supports so this is the whole bill of a

111
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,110
bike sharing a city bike sees it and

112
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,200
every splash or every so every green

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,320
splash or every red splash it's somebody

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,290
either taking a bicycle or living it so

115
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,060
let's look for instance Barcelona

116
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,180
and and we can actually see people using

117
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,720
the system and thinking okay this is

118
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,010
good and this is not something that

119
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,680
these companies even were thinking about

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,590
it or for instance let's say that we

121
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,330
want to see the nearest stations near

122
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,600
the university here in Brussels say

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,180
we'll look for it'll be Brussels Pope I

124
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,000
show probably yeah

125
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,250
so it found a network sorry the internet

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,889
it's a bit slow I should have known that

127
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,780
but we can now consult bike sharing

128
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,689
system right on your terminal and and

129
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:08,860
that's good and that's something that

130
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,689
this the company is providing the

131
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,750
service the services will then will then

132
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,159
provide by themselves because they

133
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,840
didn't even think that that it's

134
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,789
something that people would want I mean

135
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,039
who would like to check bike sharing

136
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,719
system on on their terminals or some

137
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:31,300
some guy even created a telegram boat

138
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,169
using the city bikes API so let's look

139
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,199
and you asked the boat okay with me

140
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,650
Brussels he asks my you know less than

141
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,099
one kilometer and he sends you where the

142
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,779
stations where the stations are

143
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,370
and how many empty slots Friesland

144
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,980
everything so so the point the main

145
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,820
point with with all of this and and why

146
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,380
it's important to me and why I'm

147
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,330
developing this project I mean it's not

148
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,500
about bikes anymore it's about trying to

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,350
show the companies trying to show City

150
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,560
Council's all the benefits of releasing

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,040
this information so we hear a lot with

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,880
open data with hair things like we are

153
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,150
releasing information but there are not

154
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,950
enough people doing anything with all

155
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,390
this information and and the main

156
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,240
problem it's not about the data they are

157
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,729
releasing it's the quality of it and for

158
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,830
me this project shows that when you

159
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,539
release quality data that it's free

160
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,000
useful to people people are eager to

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,460
participate even in a public project

162
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,289
that it's funded with public or private

163
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,490
money and and that's for me that that's

164
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,370
the that's the importance of of the

165
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,340
whole project that these city councils

166
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,450
should learn that people really want to

167
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,230
improve things not even if you are not

168
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,260
hard to do it and so in a sense this

169
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,810
project the main purpose of this project

170
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,040
in fact it's disappearing because so

171
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,990
right now we have this this isn't like a

172
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,840
middle part I'm extracting this

173
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,480
information I'm putting it out there in

174
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,260
clear but the the best world or the

175
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,880
future world that will like it's that

176
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,220
city likes it's not a necessary project

177
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,840
it will mean that all this information

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,900
is already available for for for

179
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,970
everyone and at that point when the

180
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,060
project can finally be shut down because

181
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,830
the information is already out there

182
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,710
then I will think I will have completed

183
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,880
the task

184
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,670
another cool or important part so what

185
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,280
happens when you add a city to do city

186
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,780
bikes

187
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,130
it's that suddenly let's say there is a

188
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,230
new system appearing in a city when they

189
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,750
get supported to the API suddenly all

190
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,660
the unofficial applications that there

191
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,240
are on the market they work with the

192
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,060
city so even the City Council in in in

193
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,170
some way they wouldn't need to create

194
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,810
their own up their own shitty app

195
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,830
usually they can already use all the

196
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,330
different many applications that are

197
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,100
using in hand that's something really

198
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,960
really important with this in the end

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,130
it's the user choice so as a user of one

200
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,840
of the systems you should have the right

201
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,120
to use whatever application you want to

202
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,490
use you shouldn't be forced to use only

203
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,270
the official one some would respect your

204
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,170
privacy some wouldn't some would look

205
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,210
nicer or even you could develop your own

206
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,710
because you don't like any of them I'm

207
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,750
having that choice having that power

208
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,150
it's what it's all about

209
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,170
thank you

210
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,279
I think we have plenty of time

211
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,779
progressives so is there a set of api's

212
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,300
that you sort of support or have

213
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,520
developed that you can say with a new

214
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,650
scheme you can say ahead of time go to

215
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,290
the city and say right you're whoever

216
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,060
implements this needs needs to implement

217
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,040
this set of api's and also sort of

218
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,529
leading on from that have you even have

219
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,060
you thought about sort of perhaps even

220
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,750
implementing open design systems for

221
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,210
that for the hardware that the the

222
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,960
schemes need to operate as well

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,120
I'm really sorry can you can you repeat

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,029
the question so there are some nice is

225
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,630
it do you have like a preferred set of

226
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,740
api's the new schemes should adopt

227
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,060
ideally so if you don't have to do the

228
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,910
scraping and have you are there people

229
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,010
sort of implementing hardware for the

230
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,779
actual bike sharing schemes themselves

231
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,760
to to to adopt these API so maybe an

232
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,279
open design for the that they can

233
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,360
actually publish the data yeah so it can

234
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,089
be enter it in in two ways for instance

235
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,570
there is a there is a system called I

236
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,750
think it's called open open bike sharing

237
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,279
or something like that and they are

238
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
releasing some source code on and some

239
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,510
documentation on how to build these

240
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,350
projects and the other one will be about

241
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,029
standardization or using the same format

242
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,500
that's being done in some by some

243
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,020
companies in the US and in Canada and

244
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,120
they are trying to do something a bit

245
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
similar to two gtps

246
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,020
well I did Google transport so it's for

247
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,810
bikes and they restarted working on this

248
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,430
like two years ago

249
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,950
and they found one problem and it's that

250
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,980
the city bikes API or the syntax that

251
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,910
that my ABI has

252
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,910
it's already supported so they release

253
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,190
on a specification and nobody uses it

254
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,529
but it was good for the project because

255
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,130
now I can i could add support in fact

256
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,600
the person that that is supported here

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,060
in the room for this format and suddenly

258
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,980
all their systems are supported in city

259
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,040
bikes and they are out there so somehow

260
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,690
without even trying the CTX api syntax

261
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,470
has managed to be the standard or the de

262
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,319
facto standard which is i think it's a

263
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,149
cool way of doing a standard just not

264
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,029
trying to do it just working on it and

265
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,360
listening to to the feedback and just

266
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,180
keeping adding and adding fields hello

267
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,149
I'm a bicycle mechanic and it's a very

268
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,769
exciting project of the first I've seen

269
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:06,579
of it

270
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,850
and I was wondering how does the project

271
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,399
aim to get the bicycles fixed which is a

272
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,290
ongoing problem with sharing bicycles

273
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,819
they always keep breaking so ideally so

274
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,800
the question is with your with the city

275
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
by project how do the bicycles get fixed

276
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,939
who fixes them and how does it happen

277
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:29,470
no no that's so the thing with all these

278
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,569
bike sharing systems they are like

279
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:35,139
public-private grant projects and they I

280
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,630
mean I I work come they completely

281
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,350
ignore at this project is so they they

282
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,880
work on another level so they usually

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,310
have bands moving around they pick the

284
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,480
bikes fix them and they have their own

285
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,149
way of looking at the world but but city

286
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,670
bikes the city bikes one like okay

287
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:05,230
I um yeah yeah okay yeah I almost forgot

288
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,300
my question oh yeah yeah you you yes I

289
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,060
how many companies you scrape from a

290
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,130
couple of licensed than others I would

291
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,020
be interested in like several questions

292
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,390
what does others mean yeah see if thank

293
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,010
others with the others

294
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,410
our next question a licensed one do you

295
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,690
pay for them they pay you or how does it

296
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,610
work so what is the license about and

297
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,940
the scraping so who does that that's

298
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,250
like like for each city is a guy who

299
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,710
updates the code who gets the data of

300
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,600
the website and what hey what do you

301
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,130
actually do with the example you showed

302
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,710
us that they only publish a picture so

303
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,420
that you don't it's like makes it hard

304
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,060
to get the data so and what actually for

305
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,360
especially unlicensed one obviously with

306
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,190
the unlicensed one do they complain do

307
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,380
they say hey don't do that or are they

308
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,660
just silent look away or not even aware

309
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,650
of it okay so the cool part about these

310
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,330
questions is that somehow they're all

311
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,480
connected connected with each other so

312
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,070
it works so the first one was about the

313
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,060
licensing one though or so this part of

314
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,300
the slide that say others right

315
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,180
others mean private sources so it's

316
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,140
either our reverse-engineer API or it's

317
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,160
a some JSON feed that it's feeding their

318
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,710
website and it isn't because it doesn't

319
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,210
have a license it's not documented it's

320
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,630
not I did so it really you know what are

321
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,630
the terms of this and it's just out

322
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,140
there and the second question was about

323
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,030
if these companies are paying me or I'm

324
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,180
paying for some and no they they don't

325
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,700
pay me and I don't pay them all so

326
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,070
obviously sometimes you had to to pay to

327
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,290
access some of this information and what

328
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,060
that happens you just hook into our

329
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,400
private API because they they always

330
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,890
have an official client so you take this

331
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,760
official client you look at what sources

332
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,660
they are

333
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,020
using which websites and genius pretend

334
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,839
to be their own client and access that

335
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,230
information and that works

336
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,470
the third was problems so obviously when

337
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,119
you are using private API is you will

338
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,920
have problems and but the cool thing

339
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,620
about this project is that it puts them

340
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,900
in a bad position somehow this project

341
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,220
is doing the work that they are not

342
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,350
doing so you don't want to be the bad

343
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,720
guys that will appear in a local

344
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,350
newspaper like big companies shuts down

345
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,000
nice guy that was trying to do a favor

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,640
to to the by train users so they they

347
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,920
just ignore it I don't know maybe some

348
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,230
of them even ignored it completely like

349
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,630
they don't even know how it works or how

350
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,510
that happens I remember one day talking

351
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,790
with one guy that was working for one of

352
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,820
these companies as a technician and he

353
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,530
told me oh wow you are the guy that did

354
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,850
this how do you access this information

355
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,220
I tell you I I mean you should know

356
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,770
right and I think I forgot about the

357
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,710
fourth question maybe maybe you guys can

358
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,120
talk afterwards because we're really out

359
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,530
of time and there's the next talk that's

360
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,510
gonna start in two minutes give them a

361
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,720
big hand for the brilliant project

362
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,739
[Applause]
