1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,659
you

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:10,990
we also if you can't hear me to speak up

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:18,460
so it's tailored composite truss was

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,990
acute variant composite of framework

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,810
it's a very long title and I will

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,880
explain it to you in a minute what I

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,929
want to tell you shortly about me you

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,519
can see Shannon's

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,840
I was the Katie projections about seven

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,550
years I did a PhD and fancy receptor and

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,020
today I'm doing completely different

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,660
things at class systems the company of

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,890
that doing these big aquaculture

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,770
machines so it's really nice to be much

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:59,649
nicer competitors it's about really

16
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,300
really nice technologies that you can

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,460
use from very devices for displaying

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,950
stuff from several processes so for

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,780
several applications with this talk I my

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,760
goal is to give a short practical

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,180
introduction to this framework tell you

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,740
how to use it how you can experiment

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,260
with it and make you eager to to really

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,310
use it since it's extremely cool I'm not

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,960
from the acute Weiland capacitor

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,370
developers I'm I know them I work a lot

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,290
with them but I'm not completely from

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,170
from them I'm looking back from the

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,300
really huge point of view on these

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:48,490
frameworks about a really nice practical

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,280
example where I won't get any problems

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,760
both funny confidential stuff with my

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,460
kitchen and a few I would have better to

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,170
buy somewhere here that helps me in the

35
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:06,610
kitchen I want to have some applications

36
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,229
that had be for example for cooking eggs

37
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,040
and for cooking a tea and maybe is

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,590
current time and some other applications

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,600
I want to have a really nice seamlessly

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,970
these applications so no border so it

41
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,910
should be pretty nicely aligned I want

42
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,340
to have some touch guests just likes my

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,970
pick to the left to the right and I'm

44
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,950
using some nice more happier like recipe

45
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,410
a pie or some other embedded hardware

46
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,380
that has a GPU so a little bit of 3d

47
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,720
acceleration that means I can use cute

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,650
creeks it's just later and the start

49
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,970
actually nobody else you can use it with

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,940
out 3d acceleration I'm not sure about

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,930
this framework but always a plus and as

52
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,060
I said before it's important point about

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,880
or having several applications there is

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,770
I have several processes that I somehow

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,350
have to compose on the screen so I need

56
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,110
a compositor so usually around in

57
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,630
capacitor and yes everything what I

58
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,760
explained there is much trip much

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,500
material to a cheap there's a similar

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,570
simple process runs run process

61
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,820
application but well if you're looking

62
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,980
at the modern use case on the automotive

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,960
industry or X for example in the

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,350
agriculture business where we have

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,720
really really hot requirements with

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,760
really heavy applications running on

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,800
this machine at the same time that you

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,690
have to compose so much harder uske is

69
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,770
actually in the air then in the

70
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,320
automotive industry

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,000
well you want to have several processes

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,550
there so I'm out to a small picture

73
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,430
about what I explained to you that's the

74
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,940
size of a pilot display I want to have

75
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,150
the applications aligned horizontally

76
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,190
I want to have this swipe guests are

77
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,030
left to draw it

78
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,430
I don't have a navigation information so

79
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,890
where I'm currently on my screens and I

80
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,200
want to have some notifications that

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,170
should we send it from the applications

82
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,970
and shown on the compositor which is

83
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,010
actually not that favorite as it sounds

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,480
of the first hearing okay and the rest

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,610
of the stroke is how can I create such a

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,740
device Rissa a cube and compositor

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,350
framework and actually I want to show a

88
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,450
compositor that fits on one slide for

89
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,700
achieving this so a little bit more

90
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,280
violent assume that all of your heart

91
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,819
name at least once

92
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,039
it's a protocol that explains how you

93
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,919
communicate between a client and to

94
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,530
display server so between an application

95
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,069
with window or several windows and the

96
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,780
application server the display server

97
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,210
which is surveillant compositor which is

98
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,949
responsible for putting the windows

99
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,050
somewhere on your screen and also for

100
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,300
import handling and so on so it's really

101
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
easy about this communication in the

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,099
embedded watch since several years

103
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,139
Bitsey default standard nobody is using

104
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,449
X anymore at least I don't know it about

105
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:08,330
anyone since it's simply protocol you so

106
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,460
you can you can implement your own

107
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,370
compositor you can find Sebastian

108
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,370
it's the reference compositor you can

109
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,289
find in the desktop environments a lot

110
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,699
of different composites or for example

111
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,349
yet on one screen and KDE genome has its

112
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,310
own indictment has its own I actually

113
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,990
also encountered a proprietary

114
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,460
compositor somewhere in the field and

115
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,159
well then gives you a basic protocol

116
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,780
sometimes you need a little bit more you

117
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,699
need want to have your own custom

118
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,979
protocol extension for example in KDE

119
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,070
bah the extension for snapshots that you

120
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,320
can ask for a snapshot of all the

121
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,210
windows together that how their current

122
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,370
is displayed on the screen that's a

123
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,289
simple protocol extension how client

124
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,909
communicates with the server it says I

125
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,919
want to have the picture can you start

126
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,659
at some real those protocol extensions

127
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,690
are create defined in a well-defined

128
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,449
standard then you have some tooling that

129
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,759
creates a boilerplate code and connects

130
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,560
it to your programs at the end you can

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,330
simply use it there are different

132
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,150
available shells which is well kind of

133
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,430
rich which language do you speak to your

134
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,639
composite or the default one is WL shell

135
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,699
that was introduced in when run on 0 and

136
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,830
we offer the xdg shell which is the

137
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,099
extra successor and we have in the

138
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,159
automotive field especially this IV

139
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,949
shell extension which gives you would a

140
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,229
small tiny interface how you can

141
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,380
communicate

142
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,780
your compositor Andrews ago that it's we

143
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,960
since interchange it's you can take any

144
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,180
compositor that speaks IV gel and you

145
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,730
exchange it wherever that is really

146
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,520
limited in what you can do there and in

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,450
my use cases will never brush until now

148
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,360
so I looked at this framework that was

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,860
cute veil and composite of framework

150
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,030
with this framework

151
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,060
I don't know how many of you are used to

152
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,930
shoot quick before see few hands

153
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,170
it's it's a declarative language that

154
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,290
well it's it exactly ideal a declarative

155
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,870
language looks like a little bit like

156
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,260
Jason and say what you want to have like

157
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,970
I want to have rectangles then you have

158
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,970
a rectangle and yeah you can do the same

159
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,070
or you can now do the same with secured

160
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,780
been in compositor framework you can say

161
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,220
I want to have a composite or I want to

162
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,010
have an output I want to put my window

163
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,740
somewhere in the output and everything

164
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,420
works nicely together so it's really the

165
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,760
power of declarative language for

166
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,280
creating such things and this acute

167
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,110
backup of the frameworks since or I

168
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,700
think two weeks it's the girls that

169
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,060
really so acute 5h beliefs nor we have

170
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,490
this for these protocol extensions

171
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,320
already taught shortly about last night

172
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,510
you can you know also get a little bit

173
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,000
more tooling that you get cute style C++

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,890
API and not only the C style API is

175
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,750
resist those frameworks it's

176
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,600
automatically generated here you can of

177
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,310
course what you want to have for several

178
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,600
screens if you are for the rise and

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,810
several money to us that's nice to have

180
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,590
it has it implements all these different

181
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,470
shells I talked about and the car is

182
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,010
actually stable and well it's the

183
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,750
essence of several years it's I think at

184
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,380
least five since acute 5.0 only the API

185
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,350
is new so it's really stable piece of

186
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,330
software up user of frameworks that you

187
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,740
have here and what I did here is really

188
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,830
this really nice cute quick style API to

189
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,740
use it in a really nice way

190
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,880
I shortly talked about the IV IV shell

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,100
extension my problem recently or until

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,000
now was or is that it's only fits from

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,410
my point of view for with aesthetic

194
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,050
settings like I have a screen and I have

195
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,779
some some vendors that I want to put

196
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,070
statically somewhere on the screen

197
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,990
that's really nicely we were doing with

198
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,940
IV

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,920
but first global guest shark control and

200
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,580
other stuff I wanted to have it didn't

201
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,010
didn't work and for such requirements I

202
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,709
would actually have to shade rock

203
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,570
directly on my vein and server and I

204
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,339
didn't want to hang on vestan so it's

205
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,760
really not my field not my experience

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,870
what I can use there so looking a little

207
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,330
bit more deeper what we can do is when

208
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,070
composite or how as possible system

209
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,050
architecture would look like we have

210
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,700
several applications we have a

211
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,310
compositor and possibly you also have a

212
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,730
well intermediate application would be

213
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,740
called a shell so you have the apps yet

214
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,730
talking to the man capacitor by the

215
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,630
default valid what we call misc in

216
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,310
whizzing huge it's a detective rise

217
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,029
acute plate for an extraction layer you

218
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,130
call it if you simply use - platformer

219
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,279
island and it works magically you can

220
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,600
also use your custom portal called

221
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,660
extension for example for notifications

222
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,240
which I introduced in this few slides

223
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,029
how you can add a small extension for

224
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,510
for notifications or you could also have

225
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,750
a proxy in between this is architecture

226
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,970
on the right side where you have a share

227
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,750
that gets all Z all information or all

228
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,779
these IP C information by some mechanism

229
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,100
and then that's that is the only real

230
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,870
Wayland client that's talking your

231
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,910
protocols and talking to the compositor

232
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,410
if you want to have a little bit more

233
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,740
stability and encapsulation of the

234
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,050
really critical stuff since you never

235
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,910
want to have surveillance so like being

236
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,270
crushy

237
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,520
and you can put your a little bit more

238
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,560
critical stuff and it's a child

239
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,040
I would look at this more simple

240
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,270
architecture here but the other one is

241
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,690
also really simple to to achieve and

242
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,900
well let's mine flight office talk

243
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,420
that's my compositor for what I told you

244
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,230
I will talk a little bit about it's on

245
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,760
this slide and said I will go a little

246
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,210
bit deeper in the next slide so like I

247
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,640
said it's declarative I did some imports

248
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,339
for the basic stuff I need there then I

249
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:35,930
said well I want to have a variant

250
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,330
compositor and then I want to have an

251
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,370
output like why would you want to have

252
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,570
something on your screen here you know I

253
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,510
have two WL shell from that I get some

254
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,220
notifications hey there's a new surface

255
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,920
so you window from application and if I

256
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,830
get such nor such windows window I put

257
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,190
it into a list model since that's nicely

258
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,990
into you easier since I want to have

259
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,460
some in those lines next to each other

260
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,680
and I simply use the default cute quick

261
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,220
stuff for lining items rectangular items

262
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,730
somewhere on the screen and I put it in

263
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,280
a wrapper called a child surface item

264
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,640
and then cue did everything from you

265
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,940
what I wanted to to have here but look a

266
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,750
little bit more deeper into it so we

267
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,030
always have or typically we have as a

268
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,190
root valent compositor it's well it's

269
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,140
actually representation of the composite

270
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,180
are in the background everything is

271
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,900
created for your brain and compositor

272
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,240
and usually you should have an output of

273
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,130
otherwise don't see anything you should

274
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,600
have a shell extension to get

275
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,339
information that you have that you are

276
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,510
surfaces to be presented the shell

277
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,850
extension actually gives you it from

278
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,550
information sent by the vena protocol

279
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,370
here we have this WL shell and we gets

280
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,680
information there's a service created my

281
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,779
own custom extensions here I can add

282
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,779
several several extensions there I can

283
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,580
also get these informations that I get a

284
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,040
signal from application like shot your

285
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,010
tea is ready

286
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,900
and we have other shells but for the

287
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
various cases usually enough to simply

288
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,860
this WHL since we don't have a fully

289
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,850
fledged

290
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,670
that's million excess appeal then we

291
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,390
have the surface surface item and the

292
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,610
cube a lyric item which are nice

293
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,260
wrappers around two surfaces so a

294
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,690
surface is simply field where you have

295
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,470
Sun well some image data and you want to

296
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,230
put it on your screen so you get you put

297
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,420
it into such a wrapper and that you can

298
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,910
use it exactly like it because huge

299
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,020
Creek item so that's a that's the

300
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,900
actually nicest thing about technology

301
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,610
you handle Windows like they are no

302
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,590
business but simply rectangles with some

303
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,270
stuff on it and so you simply should

304
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,580
click developer can simply use it with

305
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,280
only his intuition from what you usually

306
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,630
do does just consider well this surface

307
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,880
it's a rectangle and I move it I do some

308
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,910
animations on it I enlarge it I turn it

309
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,250
I put a trader on it and all the stuff

310
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,440
you can do and that's really nicely

311
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,780
since you're working on capacitor like

312
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,120
it's a simple process application

313
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,590
there's a little bit of cute cricket

314
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,140
that you get from some rail and that's a

315
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,720
real power of it that you can get on

316
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,790
high-level really nice the facts really

317
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,910
nice implicit implementations without or

318
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,770
being brought with all the technical

319
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:52,550
stuff below yeah it's visibility it's

320
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,410
doing the input stuff so I can

321
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,420
deactivate or the in from stuff I can

322
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,560
hide it I orchid showered and well it's

323
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,970
really acting like it's a particular

324
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,630
item and or of course I need an output

325
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,030
that's simply in vertical area where

326
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,150
show my movie size of the compositor and

327
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,060
I of course I can have multiple of them

328
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,740
I talked a little bit about protocol

329
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,590
extensions for my use case I said well I

330
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,270
want to have notifications at my clients

331
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,560
since they are like your T's very sorry

332
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,769
time to go to bed or what

333
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,749
whatever my my applications want to show

334
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:38,079
really globally on the screen and what

335
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,749
you see here is a typical XML snippet

336
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,959
which describes such a protocol you can

337
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,910
use a typical valent tooling

338
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,910
surveillance cannot to get the binding

339
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,360
for it

340
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,509
here I'm using the huge tooling since I

341
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,519
get a also synchronous API I can run it

342
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,529
all right and of course all right also

343
00:15:59,529 --> 00:15:59,860
called

344
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,929
code and the Talk Talk slides and

345
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,449
everything is available on github with

346
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:09,459
all history and what I said you are

347
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,079
running your tooling over it you get

348
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,759
your bone a plate code your bindings you

349
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,519
are put it into your applications and it

350
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
works and so you can have your typical

351
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,139
acicular signals and slots me I can

352
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,819
connect to where you can send data and

353
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:29,949
everything rocks and well actually is

354
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,819
that the small bits from my initial idea

355
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:35,860
what I have for my kitchen application

356
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,399
that's all well I gotten a notification

357
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,860
yet he's ready I have for two

358
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,170
applications running here and I would

359
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,420
survive I get a live daemon running here

360
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,179
let's start my compositor

361
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:59,009
there's a compositor and

362
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,099
X application let's see oh there's an

363
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,409
application and maybe it C application

364
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,980
so it is and maybe another egg

365
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,839
application then we have a little bit to

366
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,360
see her at magnification bar and I can

367
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,150
move it and cheat a little bit down I

368
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,800
can simply run the applications and well

369
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,970
it's easy to achieve something like that

370
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,690
and if I would have time would have had

371
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,520
time I could have put it on my Raspberry

372
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,190
Pi and it works I did several similar

373
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,860
things present he's ready and it's

374
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,190
really nicely working also a lot of bear

375
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,510
devices so I was faster than I thought

376
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,230
so we have little question later on I

377
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,180
can already sing starting let's start

378
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,410
syncing so again what I wanted to show

379
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,630
you in this talk is where those new

380
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,700
children capacitor framework which

381
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,520
allows you to simply create Ben

382
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,000
capacitor tailored for the specific use

383
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,630
cases and wishes for your embedded

384
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,610
device you don't have to take a stock

385
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,220
painting capacitor that is maybe come as

386
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,660
some makes problems this was cute huge

387
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,520
event loops which are also have seen

388
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,260
with a proper type proprietary

389
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,990
capacitors you could tailor it directly

390
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,510
to to the user interaction concept your

391
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,120
designers give to you since it's

392
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,160
actually designer cute quick design

393
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,760
artwork

394
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,470
what you do here the capacitor I created

395
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,550
here it's literally a one day job to

396
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,680
create such a composite or even the

397
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,570
first time I worked on it well as at

398
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,550
that time I took two days to get it

399
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,890
working

400
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,960
that's really nice thing and you can use

401
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,600
it for fast prototyping of composite to

402
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,390
us you can also use it well for doing

403
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,800
real capacitors that you want to reduce

404
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,589
later

405
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,229
and whether the problem is I already

406
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,059
said several times I think the power of

407
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,820
this parameter is that it gets the right

408
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,359
abstraction to get you you into a

409
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,330
position where you create a composite

410
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,940
composite or user interface without

411
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,309
thinking about all the complicated

412
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,249
valent related stuff

413
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,649
lower far below the surface but you can

414
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,659
really look at so your eyes or a

415
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,969
compositing and see your overall

416
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,070
interactions you want to have there to

417
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,159
get a really cool and a nice user

418
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,849
interface and the best thing is really

419
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,609
to try it out you find my coach here you

420
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,830
find a lot of examples and the cute

421
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:10,219
repositories and yeah there's also a

422
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,509
little bit of documentation however the

423
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,909
examples are sometimes more helpful

424
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,690
currently than the documentation I think

425
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,859
okay and there are a few slides for

426
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,149
three pointers

427
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,719
you're on did a nice talk about all the

428
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,570
same from our contracted con there's

429
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,869
online help and most importantly the IRC

430
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:37,899
channel okay thanks a lot for attention

431
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:57,030
any questions yes I saw an example my

432
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,340
office not yet but it really works that

433
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,809
you that you have for me

434
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,940
well several displays and several

435
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,710
outputs there are also example codes for

436
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,080
for exactly that use case the multiple

437
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,720
screen demo there are cheat repositories

438
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,809
that Co freedom you have to convert the

439
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:48,240
framework and then you look at at what

440
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,160
you want to have see want to see there

441
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,150
and the capacitor should handle it it's

442
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,370
your task to create all these effects in

443
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,720
the capacitor it only gives you a

444
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,940
framework to use it feels like acute

445
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:07,740
click and then you can implement it okay

446
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,900
no more questions then thanks a lot

447
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,330
you
