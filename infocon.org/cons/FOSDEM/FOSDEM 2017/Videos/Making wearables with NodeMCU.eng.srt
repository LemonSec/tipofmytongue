1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,810
okay I'm going to start

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,260
so some introductions first

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,290
hello I am attend this is my Twitter

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,879
handle it kind of follow me so you can

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,070
talk to me later I'm a software engineer

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,299
from Brazil

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm currently based in London where I

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,240
work for a badger by the way we are

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,609
hiring so if you have an interested in

10
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,470
going to London and this is our website

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,580
I am very active in the lower community

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,770
I have worked in many projects that are

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,010
lower related so I am the developer of

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,559
Saylor which is American Lewin I

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,600
participated in google Summer of Code

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,350
twice not once as a student and once as

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,129
a mentor I'm also running the what

18
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:53,350
conference and in Rio so come apply for

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,359
the call for papers that is open right

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,239
now the call for sponsors is also open

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,800
so if you work in a company that uses

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,269
Lua please send help

23
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,380
ok so the contents of the talk I'll show

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,350
a little bit of what no MCU after all

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,619
I'll hopefully do a demonstration and

26
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,720
then I'll share some resources so you

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,479
can get started on your own later ok so

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,409
what is not MCA I had no idea and so

29
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,840
last year a friend of mine got to me and

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,090
said oh you are a blue girl right here

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,780
take this gift for you like oh ok um

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,570
what is that and now I am here giving a

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,610
talk about this so thank you flaky if

34
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,399
you're hearing so yes so what is it

35
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,200
so the first thing you have to know is

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,159
that no x here is actually not the board

37
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,049
note MCU is a firmware that runs on this

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,509
very tiny board over here that is called

39
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,130
East

40
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,890
esp8266 I'm gonna pass it around in case

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,729
you wants to take a closer look there

42
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,100
yes some specs

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,240
so it has a processing power of 80

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,540
megahertz it has

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,970
memory of 664 K I know this sounds like

46
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,799
very little but it is way more than on

47
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,959
the popular board so for example if you

48
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,560
compare with they are doing you know

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,110
well then this little ship is like way

50
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,030
faster and it's also way way cheaper so

51
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,940
the price range of this one is between

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,090
$3 and $10 I'll say that $10 like the

53
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,750
tops you'll find maybe on the fruit

54
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,629
store or Sparkfun like if you go to

55
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,700
Aliexpress I can find them from maybe

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,239
maybe two and a half and well if you get

57
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,450
an Arduino plus the Wi-Fi shield you

58
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,840
could easily get up to $50 which could

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,329
be a little too much for just

60
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,310
experimenting something you do know

61
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,290
starting out it can be like a big

62
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,970
investment for a beginners project so

63
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,670
yeah it costs $3 it is very powerful and

64
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,579
it has Wi-Fi there are some some

65
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:30,069
advantages on on Arduino we find if I

66
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,919
want to be fair so for example this one

67
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,730
I just have just has one analog pin

68
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,639
there Arduino has more so depending on

69
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,560
your needs this one will not be suitable

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,049
but should be honest I only need one and

71
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,730
I like pin so I'm pretty happy to just

72
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,069
spend three dollars going on as I said

73
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,190
the NOTAM see is just a firmware the

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,389
whole thing that I'm passing around is a

75
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:04,599
dev board so it is ready to get started

76
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,040
since it has like a voltage regulator

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,810
because this this board is Chinese and

78
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,069
is fabricated by a company called

79
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,659
expressive so that tiny square over here

80
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,978
is DSP model itself and then there since

81
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,080
it's open hardware there are many

82
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,610
companies that fabricate their own

83
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,229
version of this board and of the module

84
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,270
with Diaz

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,910
the core so the most famous is the a I

86
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,630
think her and they had series of

87
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,810
different modules with this ESP core the

88
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,180
most famous and the one that you see in

89
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,060
the one that I'm passing around is DSP

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,520
12 and and then they are part of the the

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,100
whole is to yes be it so six six oh yeah

92
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,290
the Deaf war also has like a Syrian tree

93
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,520
so it makes it easier to program with

94
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,000
USB like I said there are many companies

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
that fabricate their own version of this

96
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,490
so you can find this all kinds of

97
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,330
electronic shops so sparkfun has their

98
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,780
own version of this word with the ESPE

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,630
cheese so nice thing about this one is

100
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,900
that is prepared to be stackable it

101
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,490
already has like an answer for the

102
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,670
battery it's all set

103
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,460
it is a little bit up in the price range

104
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,910
but depends on what you want this will

105
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,050
be really useful i discovered this one a

106
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,150
couple of days ago so i was researching

107
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,080
for the stock and i'm so this we MOS is

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,220
very tiny and super cheap so depending

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,950
on the project you want to do I've got

110
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:02,970
one oh nice nice if you want to haze it

111
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,580
so other people can see other models of

112
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:13,710
it so there you go and but the no times

113
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,200
you firmware is not compatible just with

114
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,190
the h 266 so this is an SP h 285 which i

115
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,960
only discovered so recently so i

116
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,720
couldn't get one before the stock to

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,050
show around but as you can see it is

118
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,759
super tiny and

119
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,669
and it's already has the serial and

120
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,279
entry the voltage regulator it's super

121
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,679
small so this is the perfect one for

122
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:45,629
wearables in fact so I'm very excited to

123
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:50,539
get one of these for my next project and

124
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,459
and then there is this one so this one

125
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,559
is a novelty so this is the s Peter

126
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,259
lychee so didn't know x hue firmware is

127
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,719
not yet fully compatible with this one

128
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,269
their contributors working of it on

129
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,079
github as we speak so if you want to

130
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,759
join and take a look and there is a

131
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,059
branch going on so I was fiddling and

132
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:16,289
the other day some work is happening so

133
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,999
there are some parts are very compatible

134
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,919
but probably not the whole API is

135
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,789
exposed but this is happening and this

136
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,599
in my opinion will be the true Arduino

137
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,559
killer because it is super powerful it

138
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,729
has already the Wi-Fi building like the

139
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:42,149
80286 it also has bluetooth it is super

140
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:48,809
powerful so it has over 500k memory it

141
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:55,189
has a finger to 140 megahertz ssassaror

142
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,199
mm so yeah super powerful the price

143
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,459
friends is so like so little big so it

144
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,439
was think I was around 20 $25 but that I

145
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,929
mean because it's expensive if we

146
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,049
compare with this one but if we compare

147
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,989
with an Arduino it's it's still super

148
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:20,009
cheap so this is like I'm very excited

149
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,989
to get my hands and in one of those ok

150
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:30,749
so how do you get started so if I have a

151
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:34,549
Mac a purple and each again a driver for

152
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,879
the serial entry of the the Chinese

153
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,058
module

154
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,250
I was just switching the other day this

155
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,240
is an adventure of going in websites and

156
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,550
Chinese and Russians from links that

157
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,920
strangers century on stackoverflow and

158
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,250
it sounds really really dodgy but

159
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,290
everything words I didn't get any virus

160
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,560
it's okay so it's the official driver

161
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,850
for the Chinese manufacturer it's fine

162
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,430
and so you after fiddling in many

163
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,029
websites you can get to a driver and

164
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,670
then for building firmware normally you

165
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,860
can only build it in Linux but then

166
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,810
there is this website I forgot to open

167
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:29,610
it on beforehand so there is this

168
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,560
website called not MC nba.com and it is

169
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,290
super super useful because then you can

170
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,620
select all the libraries that you want

171
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,370
do not select them all or nothing will

172
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,339
work so really the select only the ones

173
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,480
you need so normally as you can see by

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
that phone no I fine timer GPIO file

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,680
normally I also check the ADC for

176
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,190
reading the analog pin and the wheels

177
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,370
228 12 for for the lag lights well as

178
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,250
you can see there are many other stuff

179
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,360
there's CJ's it's the some cryptography

180
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,240
stuff some of them I have no idea what

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,160
they are but then there is a full

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,290
documentation somewhere

183
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,410
so you can find documentation on all of

184
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,290
them on the know Dempsey docks

185
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,600
don't worry about getting all the links

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,209
to the website and resources at the

187
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,329
moment I'm gonna share them all on my

188
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,480
slide once I'm done so I'll post it on

189
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,130
Twitter just take a look on my timeline

190
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,810
it will be there like 10 minutes after

191
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,720
my talk yeah yeah they are also in the

192
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,480
northern sea official website yeah but I

193
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,930
have a fullness of of resources wait

194
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,510
where's my mouse pointer okay okay so

195
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,079
you can build this firmware so once you

196
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,730
get the the firmware from from the

197
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,870
website you can flash it um whenever

198
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,310
Nolan's here so some some vendors that

199
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,940
will sell the esp8266 with this firmware

200
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,339
by their phone so it is super handy

201
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,120
buddy you can just get any esp8266 and

202
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,269
then flash the not MCU firmware and this

203
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,029
will allow you to program to program it

204
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,820
in Lua which is super high level and

205
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,899
super easy to maintain and way easier to

206
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,199
get started then say if this is like a

207
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,290
first wearable project for just getting

208
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,510
acquainted with the API and with this

209
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,820
kind of project so to flash it there is

210
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,579
a tool there is an official tool for

211
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,040
this it was not efficient beforehand was

212
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,040
community created and then the people

213
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,040
who built the the board they just hired

214
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,930
everyone and now it is an official tool

215
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,899
so yeah you can you can just install it

216
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,310
you can check your serial ports and then

217
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,170
you can upload from where it just

218
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,920
stalled for that website to to the board

219
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,149
and then you're ready to get started

220
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,000
yeah there is however

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
some editors who make your wife's a

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,529
little bit easy they look super ugly but

223
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:05,019
it works yeah yeah you can see oh my god

224
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:11,519
you're in title can you read yes I

225
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,610
really want an atom two again for this

226
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,730
so if anyone wants to build one place do

227
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:26,350
that so this so this is sort of an ID

228
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,769
for uploading your cold you can also use

229
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,930
it to brighter cold but I don't I just

230
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,120
use at home and then I load them here

231
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,620
and then I upload them and then with

232
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,670
this you are ready to get to get start

233
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,430
to bless your wart

234
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:52,089
so now is the demo time

235
00:13:52,089 --> 00:14:01,029
so bear with me things might go wrong so

236
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,199
let's try some where's my mouse out

237
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:12,569
there let's try some simple things

238
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:40,019
why am I doing this so for some reason

239
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,370
so there are the best shoe

240
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,610
28:12 is a protocol the let's he'll deal

241
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,630
with this types of lad I'm I should

242
00:14:52,630 --> 00:15:03,730
probably show on the thingy wait can you

243
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,870
see that yes yes so these are the

244
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,630
neopixels they are super interesting

245
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,009
because they are Dressel so you can lie

246
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,329
individual ads you can I can work with

247
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,459
them and any way you want you can pick

248
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,860
any RGB color and they are wonderful to

249
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,370
work with normally they sell in huge

250
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:38,139
strips of alone 50 to 150 lads but you

251
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,800
can also buy them in tiny units like

252
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,470
this one which is like okay which is

253
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,949
perfect for rebel projects the way they

254
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,910
are so this is like my tiny prototype

255
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,250
the way they are attached to the cloth

256
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,850
is by using conductive trad so I'm gonna

257
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,470
pass this around the case and we're

258
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,199
let's take a look as well please give it

259
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,680
back to me at the end of the talk I

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:28,839
really love my things yes yes so so so

261
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm using some alligator clips over here

262
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,000
so one for the grounds one for the data

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,160
and one for the power for tiny projects

264
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,449
like this one

265
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,029
the power that comes from the note and

266
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,000
co itself will be enough let me show you

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,060
over here the power that comes from this

268
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,970
will be enough but well these things

269
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,730
they can suck a lot of energy so if you

270
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,800
have too many of them you need an

271
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,319
external power source power source for

272
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,839
that but depending on the size of the

273
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,660
project it will not be necessary I'm not

274
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,270
sure and what is the limit

275
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,670
I do not stumble on it yet which is

276
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,640
great well yeah if you have too many you

277
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,599
need more power

278
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,119
but yeah the data can still come from

279
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,809
here and everything will be fine

280
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:33,500
so let me like some of this stuff wait

281
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,360
where is my mouth I always keep losing

282
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:51,030
my mouth so for some reason the RGB of

283
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,230
the API is not RGB it is green red blue

284
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,169
instead of red green blue as everything

285
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:03,150
else but that's all right so you can

286
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:10,860
just send like the hash and then for

287
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,928
example if you do this and then

288
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:41,350
whatwhere oh thank you hopefully that

289
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,850
 light one lad in magenta and

290
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,620
wanting blue while it partially works

291
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,600
[Music]

292
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,259
which is a good start

293
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:06,070
hmm what happened here oh yeah well

294
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,809
still then there's two Mitchell adds

295
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:13,389
magenta instead of only one hmm I hope I

296
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,909
didn't burn one lad let me try something

297
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:24,730
different so this should light six lads

298
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,499
in magenta oh yeah okay I don't know

299
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,590
what was going on before so this is the

300
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,330
power of demos I'm gonna show this on

301
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:48,100
the there you go so other things you can

302
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,519
do with the ESP is as it has a Wi-Fi

303
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,950
module oh let me get my face out of

304
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,480
there I am gonna keep losing my mouse

305
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,879
pointer all the time as it has a very

306
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:13,629
ofa board a fire wall and are very easy

307
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,830
to use API you can very easily just make

308
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,119
an access point and launch a web server

309
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,139
so for example

310
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,400
so with the Wi-Fi library we can set the

311
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,610
demo to access point the Wi-Fi part the

312
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,860
IP part is not necessary but if you're

313
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,360
launching a web server you probably

314
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,210
don't want the IP should keep changing

315
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,880
all the time so you can set one and then

316
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,130
you can launch your access point with a

317
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:22,070
SSID and a password so if I send this

318
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,890
over here if I said one bar line only

319
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:37,870
this should be global it's it work

320
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:47,010
oh yeah there we go so it is it is super

321
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,040
easy to create an access point with with

322
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
with this board we can do things a

323
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,150
little bit more complicated so much

324
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,480
better

325
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:16,080
sorry I don't know yes you can you you

326
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,340
can you can try let's see if it crashes

327
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,360
and burns you can go ahead wait what was

328
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:33,660
the password again hello hello and then

329
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,580
if you want to create our web server

330
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,910
it's also super straightforward wait

331
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,830
this is not my example isn't oh this is

332
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,760
not the example I wanted but yeah you

333
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,890
can create a server you can put the

334
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,260
server to listen and then you pass a

335
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:01,230
callback and then was the client and the

336
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,480
request and then you can do things like

337
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,290
parsing it and then you can do stuff and

338
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,240
then you can have a buffer then you can

339
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,770
send to the client afterwards and I do

340
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,660
have some I also wrote some libraries

341
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,520
should work on my stuff so so this all

342
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,919
started because I just graduated three

343
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,690
months ago and I wanted to have a

344
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,740
killing dress for my graduation party

345
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,260
which is this one

346
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,890
so I stalled some pixels on its flower

347
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,140
of the dress let me put this over

348
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,350
so install one on its flower of the

349
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,669
dress and the super dress is perfect

350
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,779
because then this thing really blends

351
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:12,919
into the cloth it's all sealed with the

352
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,850
conductive thread that I mentioned

353
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,500
before I'm not sure if you can see it

354
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:27,480
here can you see that so the swivel trap

355
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,490
does its work and then here I have the

356
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:48,830
entry point so this was a very fast

357
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,899
project so I didn't have time to get

358
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:56,640
from the prototype phase to a very nice

359
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,080
and soldered model so initially I didn't

360
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,000
like any soldering at all and I

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,820
literally glued the breadboard

362
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,700
at the back of the skirt and connected

363
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,529
the alligator clips to those entry

364
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,500
points I showed before so it was all

365
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,419
very experimental but the part of the

366
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,440
dress went on the party line for many

367
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,700
hours and was a huge success

368
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,230
let me get back to here ok so I also

369
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:37,529
created some libraries to should be able

370
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:43,320
to manipulate this pixels easier so let

371
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,799
me try

372
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,879
I'll go one minute over the top

373
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,070
okay so I started parsing some stuff on

374
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,590
my web server and I created some

375
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:47,660
libraries that help with managing all

376
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:58,720
this color so it makes it very easy to

377
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,750
manipulate the pixels externally and

378
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,830
then with that I was able so something

379
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,390
that was part of my demo that was stolen

380
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,390
yesterday so you can have there is an

381
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,390
app for Android I'm sure that is one for

382
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,280
iOS and everything else as well there

383
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,350
allows you to create widgets that send

384
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,370
HTTP requests so you can create some

385
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,640
buttons with some presets post

386
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,230
configuration then you can have

387
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,660
different buttons for different kinds of

388
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,299
animations so with timer and coroutines

389
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:38,360
you can do very complex animations so

390
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:50,240
for example and then you can you can do

391
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,750
this so I can I can show the cold should

392
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,970
app and I don't really have much time so

393
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,370
with some github slash Etienne slash

394
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,150
super haze which is the name of my dress

395
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:16,370
and and then I also got like plenty of

396
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,620
resources which I will not go for right

397
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,049
now because my time is up but I will

398
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,919
share this slide on my Twitter account

399
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,530
so there is the links for projects

400
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,210
documentation and other little resources

401
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,610
and that's it thank you

402
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:58,440
questions so the question was if the if

403
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,559
the device can send HTTP requests to the

404
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,010
outside and the answer is yes so not

405
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,670
only you can launch it can so the Wi-Fi

406
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,860
models not only prepared she open itself

407
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,600
as an access point but also to connect

408
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,270
to an external network and most fir had

409
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,250
that you are able to send requests so

410
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,100
there is an HTTP library for that

411
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,079
[Music]

412
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,480
probably so he was saying that then

413
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,210
hackers can hack all kinds of IOT

414
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,470
devices yes this is like kind of going

415
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,800
discussion on hot kernels and all kinds

416
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,130
of Technology websites for ages you can

417
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,360
see the nails of like hacked baby

418
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:08,010
modules well it wasn't a party people

419
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,920
were pretty drunk and I don't think they

420
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,980
were trying to hack things in the mean

421
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,490
time so the question was is it

422
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:26,910
waterproof no I mean probably not I

423
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,240
didn't try washing and I I wouldn't I

424
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,510
I really want to research like and find

425
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,000
out waterproof stuff because that will

426
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,270
make things like weight easier that is

427
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,650
the point of being waterproof

428
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:18,500
so the question was so the question was

429
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,830
so the Wi-Fi model of this board is very

430
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,890
power comes lots of flowers so how long

431
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,950
can you expect a battery shahram so well

432
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,220
that depends on your battery and it

433
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,070
depends on what other things you were

434
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:44,400
doing I don't know but my muzzle was

435
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,720
connected to an external battery charger

436
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,010
hidden in my stockings and it lasted the

437
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,440
whole party which was like solid 5 hours

438
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,940
more I was using the Wi-Fi model because

439
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,030
I was switching so for the party I also

440
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,410
made a small pebble app with was just a

441
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,640
many sending HTTP requests so the pebble

442
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,170
app was connected to the phone which

443
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,890
created the Wi-Fi the the model was

444
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,920
connected to a huge hack then I could

445
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,690
send the HTTP request from the pebble to

446
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,400
the microcontroller and then I cook like

447
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,420
switch colors and switch blinking

448
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,930
patterns I had like rainbow patterns all

449
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,170
sorts of stuff I also had an equalizer

450
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,150
module so so I was also using a tiny

451
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,290
microphone and then I could read the

452
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,390
analog input from this and make the

453
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,950
dress reactive to music I so it was

454
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,360
blinking with the music everything and

455
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,080
everything but I tried to refactor this

456
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,370
before coming

457
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,710
to pause them and then I'm ruined it so

458
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,670
I can't really show right now so yeah

459
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,140
because it was like hey I'm gonna

460
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,880
present something I need to make my

461
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,160
codes presentable before I put it on

462
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
github cuz well I was doing my dress

463
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,020
like the goal was just well it will be

464
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,470
my own code and and and and I wanted to

465
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,350
make it pretty and then I and so yeah

466
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,460
the time is up

467
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,790
sorry

468
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:35,719
