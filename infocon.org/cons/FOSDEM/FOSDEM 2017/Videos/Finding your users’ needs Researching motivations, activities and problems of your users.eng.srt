1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,260
how're you give it a start

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,389
okay awesome so hello we are young and

3
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,480
Charlie and we're going to talk about

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,810
finding his Amit's we both work together

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,560
as UX designers and UX researchers at

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,140
the commedia - turned on to products

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,720
which is Viki data and big data is a

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,320
semantic knowledge database having stuff

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,390
like the things you see right hand side

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,520
in this info boxes on Wikipedia like how

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,700
many people live in Berlin and so on and

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,800
much more awesome stuff which you can do

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,050
with that and also German Wikipedia

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,230
where we mainly improve function skated

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,560
to heavy users like authors

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,070
administrators and so on yeah as we saw

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,800
on the panel discussion user needs was

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,410
similarly rated very as very important

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,649
and luckily that's the topic of our talk

20
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:09,880
and let's right dive into it so the

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,680
first big question in that regard is why

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,390
do we need to know user needs I mean it

23
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,880
sounds like like pretty good but when

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,909
when does that come like - to be

25
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,400
important and naturally I would say it's

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,530
always important but I think in 2k so

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,650
that it's sort of most obvious and in

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,229
the course of a product which is like

29
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,570
when you when you want to enter into a

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,240
new field which is sort of the ideal

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,430
thing you would first do the research

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,710
and then create a product naturally like

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,270
in the most cases there is already

34
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,630
product idea and then with that idea you

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,310
or slightly after you start the research

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,060
and then guide the course of the of the

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,000
product and its features and at new

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,850
ideas that by the user research and by

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,250
that it also helps the creativity in in

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,720
finding what the product should do and

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,818
an obvious question now would be like

42
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,269
why don't you ask just what users want

43
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,629
but that's like a very tricky thing here

44
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,450
like

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,690
old and overuse quote on that if I'd

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,190
asked people what they wanted they would

47
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,830
have said faster horses attributed to

48
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,530
Henry Ford who never said that

49
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,670
[Music]

50
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,490
but it neatly demonstrates that like

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,170
just asking okay like what shall we

52
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,420
build please tell us may not be the

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,440
ideal way and if you want to like tackle

54
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,270
it on a more abstract less figurative

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,150
level and knowing wishes of people and

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,040
what they imagined to be good for them

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,130
is not the same as understanding and

58
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,440
having an understanding of uses of their

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
activities motivations problems is very

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,320
important to build a motivated to build

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,660
a coherent product that is not just a

62
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,420
collection of features but a thing that

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,810
fits together so we want to understand

64
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,800
the how and why of the user's work and

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,570
that is that is a very important point

66
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,209
and during the course of the talk it

67
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,580
will be about like how can we do that

68
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,070
and how can we we do that together with

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,940
the team as I said we want to we want to

70
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,680
know about the the meaning of things

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,370
about actions of users and go beyond

72
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,510
single issues and and make them fit

73
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,489
together to a product that helps the

74
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,700
user and naturally you don't know like

75
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,080
when you start with the research about

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,810
the house and Weiss yet so it is a very

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,790
important principle and user research to

78
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,110
allow for discovery what does that mean

79
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,690
it means that you want to discover new

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,090
things you don't expect yet to be the

81
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,510
case

82
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,269
one important principle that we often

83
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,459
use in our research methods is asking

84
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,220
open questions so typically what often

85
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,620
pops up yet let's do a survey let's just

86
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,630
asking a questions but those are often

87
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,750
so so-called closed questions that allow

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,720
only a small range of answers like do

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,910
you do this or that or would you like

90
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,738
that and then you get like a single

91
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,589
single word answer like no but what we

92
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,710
actually want to get to know new things

93
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,440
that we don't know about yet and be

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
surprised

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,229
we strive to ask open questions in a

96
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,500
sort of conversation and observing the

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,479
user's style that would be like please

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,430
describe how you started your work today

99
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,280
and that demands a story like answer in

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
which you get potentially many new

101
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,720
informations and the users can talk like

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,250
paragraphs over paragraphs if

103
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,259
transcribed about how they started their

104
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,220
day so how does that look in an actual

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,819
project project if we do that well to

106
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,970
get to know about users you need first

107
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,099
the data like for example what people

108
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,250
answer to these questions and there are

109
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,349
several rights to do that and we show

110
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,050
you some methods and examples of it and

111
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,330
usually we kick off our user research

112
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,139
with preparing and collecting the

113
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,789
knowledge that already is on the team

114
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,490
it's anyway impossible to tour a start

115
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,729
with a totally blank slate so it is good

116
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,919
to collect some knowledge and

117
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,069
assumptions of the team first and what

118
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,490
we do in that case for example is

119
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,199
trading a mind map together with our

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,940
colleagues together with some expert

121
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,169
users for example and for example here

122
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,400
on the right hand side we collected

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,110
still incomplete but huge map of things

124
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,789
you can do in our image database

125
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,909
Wikimedia Commons like uploading images

126
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,789
commenting on images and so on and we

127
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,979
tried to see in which problem space we

128
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,710
are moving in researching the needs of

129
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,479
Commons users and based on that we can

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
create a guide on where we have

131
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
information needs where we want to know

132
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,610
more about the workflows and so on and

133
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,110
when you collect the information you

134
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,940
already have that was in the heads of

135
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,789
your developers of like expert users you

136
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,370
may have access to you would create a

137
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,560
research guide they write that down what

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,349
you want to ask and you would then go as

139
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,110
it's called in the field to your users

140
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,069
and gather that data and the typical

141
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,070
method with which which we apply most is

142
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,949
like talking to users and observing them

143
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,320
having demonstrations of their work

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,240
but before we can do that naturally we

145
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,490
would need to find the users currently

146
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,270
we do mostly research with with expert

147
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,840
users that are part of our communities

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,930
so we recruited a lot by a mailing lists

149
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,670
as if people would be interested and

150
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,880
also made transparent the what we hope

151
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,640
users can gain from that research but

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,080
there are like several other methods you

153
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,170
can get participants in that research

154
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,420
and then we hopefully gather interesting

155
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,670
insights and data and Charlie will

156
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,560
introduce you to some examples where we

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,730
did that in projects all right so one

158
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,520
thing we try to do is to meet the users

159
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,010
in real life and not remote which is not

160
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,570
always possible and you obviously don't

161
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,820
always want that as well if your

162
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,500
communities may be very international

163
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,850
but if you talk to them in person then

164
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,620
you can see finer nuances in their

165
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,150
responses and I did this for one of my

166
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,730
research projects where I we have in our

167
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,100
office we have a bi-weekly community

168
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,930
Meetup of the German Wikipedia community

169
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,730
um editors mostly only actually so I go

170
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,590
there regularly and talk to them even if

171
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,930
I don't have specific questions just to

172
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,450
find out what what the current problem

173
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,950
is because they chat about all this went

174
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,370
wrong in blah blah blah and but if I

175
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,780
have specific questions I can always ask

176
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,170
him about it and even conduct a little

177
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:20,720
research and yeah like I said if if you

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,590
use it right sorry the another thing

179
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,070
that we once tried is to gather insights

180
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,470
on a topic with a specific scope was to

181
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,299
do this in an open online format so

182
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,620
since Wikipedia is a wiki people are

183
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,659
comfortable with the format of a wiki

184
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,469
and we after we conducted a research we

185
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,360
posted our scenarios that we came up

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,070
with there and ask the community to

187
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,690
comment on those scenarios and

188
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,260
contribute to them so kind of as a

189
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,300
feedback loop to see um if they can

190
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,340
identify with them and if they represent

191
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,030
the

192
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:02,570
the issue at hand well yes so and then

193
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,400
what yon already mentioned a remote

194
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
research is very useful if you have a

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,780
large international community that

196
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,970
Wikimedia Commons does for example which

197
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,860
is this media repository where you can

198
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,740
upload all your Creative Commons media

199
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,870
files to share with the world and there

200
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,940
will usually do like a Google hangout or

201
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,640
Skype depending or whatever the user is

202
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,990
most comfortable with that's usually the

203
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,490
easiest way to go and also the thing is

204
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,490
this can be restrictive though since the

205
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,680
user needs to be comfortable enough with

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,270
a computer and with this video chatting

207
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,930
so this already kind of restricts your

208
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,330
user group that is that you can talk to

209
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,210
um but yeah but we do ask them to share

210
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,490
their screen of their willing and guide

211
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,280
us through a workflow and we try to ask

212
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,960
those open questions that Jana mentioned

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,380
before and find out their motivations

214
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,640
and how they work okay so what you now

215
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,360
have after having conducted five to ten

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
interviews would be typical you have

217
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
like a lot of data usually we write that

218
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,180
down in notes we made during the

219
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,220
interviews or even transcripts of the

220
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,870
audio and having the data in that form

221
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,280
doesn't mean that you can use it well

222
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,980
because it's basically like a long long

223
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,670
text structured by sort of the time the

224
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,530
linear timeline and you you went through

225
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,530
there and to have it in a better

226
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,980
accessible form for use by designers by

227
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,660
management you need to make sense of

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,520
that data and structure it in the

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,870
accessible way this is partly based on

230
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,540
interpretation so it is empirical since

231
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,270
it uses like that gain data but it's

232
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,430
also subjective because there are

233
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,020
different ways to interpret something

234
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,810
you use a set and I often compare that

235
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,270
to building a Lego house so like you

236
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,890
would have like some material we'll

237
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,500
start with and

238
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,009
then you put it into a coherent form

239
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,720
there's also a bit of creativity in that

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,790
and there are also like many different

241
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,800
ways for example to build a house but

242
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,290
it's like not an arbitrary process just

243
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,779
taking that that bunch of Lego bricks

244
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,089
and throwing it somewhere else doesn't

245
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,829
make it a house doesn't make it a

246
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:31,850
coherent structure and also there are

247
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,199
like certain rules on that kind of

248
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,319
interpretation and so on question is

249
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,870
like a nice abstract metaphor and nice

250
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,810
label breaks how does that look like

251
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,709
when we do that and typically and also

252
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,689
like the form we know Shou Shou since

253
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,620
it's like most visually it's clustering

254
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,430
notes on a big wall so like on every of

255
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,920
these sticky notes there would be like

256
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,980
one assertion a user made like a little

257
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,160
clipping and you end up with like I

258
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,579
don't know 100 200 nodes of these often

259
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,420
and then you start to put them up and

260
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,220
you put up more and more and like then

261
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,079
you you see some share similarities and

262
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,170
you already like maybe have some some

263
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,079
headlines for them and then over the

264
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,490
time you also improve the headlines

265
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,790
usually you start with some labels like

266
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,490
maybe images or upload or something like

267
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,220
that and later on you may come up with a

268
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,790
more with the title that's more closer

269
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,649
to a design principle or to a problem

270
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,189
like uploading images is difficult or if

271
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,129
I edit I do edit a bunch of images

272
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,569
instead of run or something like that

273
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,389
and so like over the course of the of

274
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,339
the research you would like make the

275
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,220
clusters more clear redo them redo them

276
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,110
again and so on like you would do if you

277
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,259
built with Lego and then at the end

278
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,420
maybe like find out some sort of general

279
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,490
themes that you hold is very important

280
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,189
and that's what that looks like then in

281
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,259
sort of on the as a photo on the on the

282
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:14,209
wall so that will result in a in a list

283
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,170
of things like general principles stuff

284
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,630
that repeats for the user you know in a

285
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,860
way that has like an important

286
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,209
meaning for for you or them but like

287
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:27,980
still it isn't like it's a form that's

288
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,300
very well accessible for you as a

289
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
researcher but maybe not for management

290
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,399
or programmers and so on so you will

291
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,230
bring that into different formats that

292
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,070
you can use well in design and some of

293
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,170
these formats and examples for them will

294
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:49,579
be introduced by Charlie now right so

295
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,810
you've got your structured data now and

296
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,190
you want to communicate it to to your

297
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,790
colleagues or colleagues or community

298
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,029
members and one thing you can do is you

299
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:07,490
can use personas so those are profiles

300
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,220
of functional your users and they have a

301
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,130
role they have a name they have specific

302
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,410
problems they're in a specific place in

303
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,149
their life they have specific activities

304
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,860
and this helps when developing to to

305
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,079
relate the things you're doing to

306
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,480
someone so you're not doing it for some

307
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,490
generic person but you try to envision

308
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,190
like I'm programming this for Melissa

309
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,800
because she needs this exact function

310
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,579
and um yeah so this is usually a very

311
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:43,910
helpful tool and we want to find out how

312
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,670
exactly Melissa works or any of the

313
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,240
personas and one tool we use a story

314
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,329
mapping so this is a workflow

315
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,890
visualization where every specific step

316
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:05,060
is yes is lined out and for every

317
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,029
specific step you can have a very very

318
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:10,250
specific notes which are the pin post as

319
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,940
you see as well as motivations and also

320
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,250
putting it out like this can help the

321
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,560
developers and anyone come and comment

322
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,730
and get a better feel for yeah the

323
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,620
workflow the other thing that's really

324
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,730
helpful is paper prototyping so um this

325
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,199
is really you can do this really well

326
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,870
with people that also not very

327
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,279
because um because it's very interactive

328
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,900
you can change things really easily you

329
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,870
don't get too attached to the the actual

330
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,640
mock-up that you're making and you can

331
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,260
even click through it like replace

332
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,260
papers and and yeah envision how it

333
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,830
could look later so there are some

334
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,020
challenges we we still want to improve

335
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,960
our research and I will give you a very

336
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,510
brief introduction on what what would be

337
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,720
future topics for the next year one of

338
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,600
them is increasing contribution culture

339
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,870
so as we like talked about a lot already

340
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,020
like that open-source software

341
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,970
development is often very focused with

342
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,430
all its tools and workflows on coding

343
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,400
and we would like to have the

344
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,140
possibilities that you as a developer

345
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,600
can do like submit a patch something

346
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,650
like that also for our community and to

347
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,350
design with them instead of just for

348
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:45,310
them also we try to go into the realm of

349
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,380
like finding different design tools that

350
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,560
for example is dry o which is basically

351
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,870
like an other pet for diagramming and

352
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,810
wire framing that we want to use more in

353
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,790
the future because there you can easily

354
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,709
collaborate with other Internet users

355
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,370
and I just went out to that that we did

356
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,380
that because I'm putting everything out

357
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,869
in open source as like as a Creative

358
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,400
Commons license you've been using open

359
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,230
source tools as helpful but that's

360
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,000
always like post process that like the

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,939
community can then after the fact edit

362
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,250
and use it but we are trying to more

363
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,170
collaboratively work with them so what

364
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,089
we also do is maybe do workshops with

365
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,130
them where we not teach them stuff but

366
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,589
we develop prototypes with the community

367
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,160
actively another thing is right now

368
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,590
we're having like when we recruit users

369
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,260
we do this individually so we ask every

370
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,970
single one of them if they would like to

371
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,240
help us which works maybe if we don't

372
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,800
need so many for a big qualitative

373
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,670
analysis of analysis but um sorry there

374
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,310
we go but if we need doing

375
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,340
shorter usability tests we need more

376
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,650
people and we don't have a participant

377
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,000
pool right now and we're trying to build

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,030
this but there are many legal issues and

379
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,510
and so we were actually talking with a

380
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,550
lawyer right now and to set up of

381
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,970
paperwork that is like legally sound and

382
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,440
when we're done we're hoping to publish

383
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,870
it so anyone with an open source project

384
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,960
can use this to then have a you know

385
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,280
sound base for a participant pool

386
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,930
because of like data security issues you

387
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,410
know you know that thing and other thing

388
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,490
is we want our stuff to work for

389
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,700
everyone and right now getting like

390
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,130
finding users is only easy with expert

391
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,630
users because those are the ones already

392
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,700
on mailing lists and IRC and on vicky's

393
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,190
but how do we get the ones that are like

394
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,140
passive like readers of Wikipedia it's

395
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,310
hard to get to them so a thing we can do

396
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,800
is what the English Wikipedia does have

397
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,770
banners for non logged in users but also

398
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,570
thinking about just contacting people on

399
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,910
Facebook or Twitter so we're people that

400
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,290
like the product but maybe don't

401
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,690
contribute can see it yeah here are some

402
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,360
useful links if you're interested in

403
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,670
more research methods and those all

404
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,210
under Creative Commons as well and right

405
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,550
so that's our email and Twitter handle

406
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,150
and you can find more open source design

407
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,250
things on open source design dotnet and

408
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,890
please give us feedback and also were

409
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,970
hiring so check that link and yeah if

410
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,360
you want to talk to us we're here and

411
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,950
the key data product managers here as

412
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:32,320
well as well as community manager that's

413
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,330
it sorry the law had to rush the last

414
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,600
minutes

415
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:45,119
[Applause]

416
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:04,160
do we talk too fast we've done this on

417
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,200
Viki so we we have this thing called

418
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
project chat and so we opened an issue

419
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,860
and an issue like a thing and just asked

420
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,750
what do you think about this issue what

421
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,010
are your problems who have you generally

422
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,860
yeah what do you want us because we we

423
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,940
knew we were gonna work on it but we

424
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,260
didn't exactly know where to start and

425
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,570
this was actually quite helpful so there

426
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,310
was a very open question and you can get

427
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,950
a lot of stuff that maybe is not useful

428
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,880
but it was a really good start like pre

429
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,210
research thing to gather some first

430
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,580
information yeah usually it helps to

431
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,200
provide some structure with it like the

432
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
scenarios we gave to give people some

433
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,110
form how they can answer then we already

434
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,510
had like scenarios already was after the

435
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,750
research but we do have like some

436
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,400
questions that they can then answer not

437
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,570
just like tell us anything

438
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:38,500
but we want to because it's like a the

439
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,679
screen for example that's something and

440
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,270
we do anonymize them so when we talk to

441
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,910
them we don't we don't use the name or

442
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,559
something or maybe even not even their

443
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:58,720
username because you know because we

444
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,580
needed to be legally sound like they

445
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,320
need to right now we're just doing that

446
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:09,040
kind we just kind of we need them to

447
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,929
sign that it's okay that we talk to them

448
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,910
and that we can use the data in an

449
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,590
aggregated away and so forth

450
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,960
it's just that people need to consent if

451
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:26,220
you yes that data like I yeah

452
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,350
um well that Vicki data big data is

453
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,090
developed mainly in Germany and that's

454
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,760
where our research goes if we do

455
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,120
research that concerns Wikipedia we

456
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,770
share that with our colleagues and our

457
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,270
in close contact with them to discuss

458
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:55,460
that research and our methods very

459
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,230
likely not doing that because they have

460
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,420
no software stuff and then certainly

461
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,540
nobody who does specific user research

462
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,570
on software sharing occurs with the

463
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,630
Vicki Media Foundation who they are like

464
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,890
the biggest chapter and they we try it

465
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,300
we are in an open discussion with them

466
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,280
all the time so we do share a lot

467
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,520
[Music]

468
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,779
[Applause]
