1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,659
with love

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,900
the next talk to the next hands-on

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,730
session compared to what with the

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,119
predator so lightning with engine Excel

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,520
GMP and culture player and cat well

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,160
[Music]

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,630
hello and thank you for joining us in

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,750
this sunny lovely Bay I'm just and I'll

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,490
be showing you a practical hands-on

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,170
guide as to how to achieve

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,440
live-streaming using all open-source

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,110
components so we'll review the

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,910
components consisting of this solution

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,660
in a moment and this is a really short

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,900
hands-on tutorial on how to achieve that

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,280
so without further ado let's start this

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,980
is basically what I've just said so the

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,710
components we'll be using are and your

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,380
next the RTMP model for it

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,620
Kaltura is html5 player which czar also

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,540
mentioned in his previous session and

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,480
our Cooper a server and I'll show you

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,939
exactly how to get that done licenses so

24
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,670
everything is open sourced and genexus

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,229
bsd the rtmp model as well where a GPL

26
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,670
ffmpeg is GPL and that's pretty much

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,450
what consists of our solution the

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,359
installation is quite easy we provide

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,749
both rpms and temps which run on RHEL

30
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:32,029
santora's Debian and Ubuntu accordingly

31
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:35,840
and we support various PHP versions as

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,459
well so starting from 5 3 and up to 7

33
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,329
all right now the presentation includes

34
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,009
link to installing the software as well

35
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,349
a free installed it it takes about 10

36
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,049
minutes and the entire sessions 25 so

37
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,840
out of that consideration the demo will

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,549
be live but the installation would not

39
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,709
be demonstrated it's quite easy and

40
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,099
we're happy to get support and questions

41
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,049
via the forum or email and various other

42
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,859
options that are mentioned later on so

43
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,348
let's review some of the important

44
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:11,150
packages that we have for this solution

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,610
as I said we produce both Deb's in our

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,290
PMS

47
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,370
decoder nginx

48
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,250
is mostly a vanilla and X that's

49
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,170
compiled with a few extra modules that

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,629
we require one of them is of course and

51
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,060
the main component in our presentation

52
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,970
is the RTMP model that's also entirely

53
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,099
open sourced as have said licensed under

54
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,670
BSD and then we also have the cultural

55
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,310
based component which is which provides

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,750
the server-side code which is mostly PHP

57
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,640
that's also entirely open source stage

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,069
appealed we have V equal to R front

59
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:48,769
which consists of an Apache web server

60
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,530
running our player which is written in

61
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,489
PHP mostly PHP and JavaScript and we

62
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,280
have the ffmpeg that we also use for

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,670
live streaming mostly people when they

64
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,340
think about our compete they often use a

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,129
family but that's closed sourced and I

66
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,349
personally don't like closed source

67
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,720
solutions so much so I'll show you how

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,230
to livestream using ffmpeg only seeing

69
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,650
how we make fast use of F MPEG in other

70
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,989
components of our server including to

71
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,470
perform the transcoding operations we

72
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,780
already have that included so if you've

73
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,950
installed Co to a server

74
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,799
you also get ffmpeg command line utility

75
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,500
that you can freely use and achieve goal

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
so the rtmp configuration the

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,230
configuration pass vary somewhat

78
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,269
depending on whether you've installed

79
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,500
rpms or Deb's

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,199
but the configuration itself is unified

81
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,459
so in our current environment we'll be

82
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,180
using Ubuntu so that's a dead package

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,829
now this keyboard is gonna be somewhat

84
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,030
challenging because it's both Mac and a

85
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,889
French layout so we'll see how well I do

86
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,889
if I don't do that well it's not because

87
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,829
I'm stupid I'm just no use to it all

88
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,839
right so try to be understanding

89
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,180
that's far I've done well I managed to

90
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,769
slash and everything I'm so proud of

91
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,460
myself um I don't think we can see too

92
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,479
well then she's a bit of a concern to me

93
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,200
can you see her

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,870
right alright good so it's just me the

95
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,340
most important portion of our

96
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,250
configuration this is the nginx config

97
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,910
file the main one is here so this is the

98
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,410
HTTP server this is an integration with

99
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,180
a different model that we'll be showing

100
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,040
today that I've actually demonstrated

101
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,430
last year that's our own nginx VOD model

102
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,490
I recommend you check the session from

103
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,810
last year because it might interest you

104
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,600
as well but wouldn't stick to that at

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,450
the moment then we say that we'd like to

106
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,870
listen on port 88 this is just a random

107
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,580
choice you could put it on any for it

108
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,710
the reason why I'm not using 80 is

109
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,920
because Apache consumes 80 we use that

110
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,680
for the front end so this could easily

111
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,330
be because we have other applications

112
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,890
for the server I'll be showing them as

113
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,390
well they're not the focus of this

114
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,160
session I'll show them alright so we've

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,410
chosen 88 you could choose anything else

116
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,440
frankly 88 is not that good of a choice

117
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
because it's well-known port for

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,510
Kerberos or nobody uses it nowadays but

119
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,950
still I wouldn't recommend it so choose

120
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,670
something else like 88 for example and

121
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,900
then we have the server name we'll be

122
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,820
using an IP because it's a demo machine

123
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,230
and then we go to the rtmp configuration

124
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,620
portion now a few words about nginx it's

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,140
a very good server or can do a lot and

126
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,110
has a lot of interesting models starting

127
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,520
from version 1 911 DSO support was

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,380
introduced DSO is they now shared

129
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,320
objects so you could dynamically compile

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,130
ditional modal's on 20 X and loaded

131
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,720
prior to dock you had to statically

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,900
compiled all models into the nginx and

133
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,570
that's the reason why we produce our own

134
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,410
code or nginx package if you're using

135
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,680
our nginx from higher versions you could

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,320
compile these models on I mean

137
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,200
independently and load them during our

138
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,850
run

139
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,620
so that's an important note so for a TMP

140
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,870
the configuration the the very basic

141
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,240
configuration is quite simple we'll just

142
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,170
say listen on port 9000 5 TCP which is

143
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,170
the default rtmp mode now on port

144
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,160
alright and we'll be using that to

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,340
stream to the server and then as far as

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,830
playback is concerned we'll use

147
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,130
HLS and port 88 which again could be

148
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,010
changed now as far as the application

149
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,460
close we'll say we'll call it cave live

150
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,320
for example k4 cultura then we need to

151
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,260
allow the live input in our case we'd

152
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,650
like both - segments and HLS segments

153
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,430
and manifests so we've got both - on in

154
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,460
the - path that's where the manifest and

155
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,760
the fragments would be stored and we've

156
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,810
got the H less we similar directive now

157
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,720
of course on a production environment

158
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,130
you'd like to have more than one node

159
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,830
from both redundancy and capacity so

160
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,670
bear in mind that in such a setup the

161
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,170
HLS path in the end

162
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,570
- paths need to be accessible from both

163
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,540
nodes you could put it behind a very

164
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,700
simple load balancer even an H a proxy

165
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,950
for example in which case you could also

166
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,620
produce SSL offloading so that you could

167
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,410
use rtmp over SSL as well for encryption

168
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,020
if you're interested many big vendors

169
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,580
have this concern where they'd like

170
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,710
everything to be encrypted so that's a

171
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,590
very cheap and easy way to do start in

172
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,810
our set up it's just one node so it's

173
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,530
irrelevant but just saying sorry Larry

174
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,380
all right so that's our configuration

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,530
now let's go to our web interface for a

176
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,710
moment if you don't mind

177
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,599
mmm this would be a very massive

178
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,390
challenge to find these semi column I

179
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,949
can do it I believe in myself

180
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,130
all right perhaps I can't can you

181
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,510
what do you want to do on this one I

182
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,240
want the column

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,950
lovely yes very good

184
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,560
he's smarter than I am that's very

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,380
impressive

186
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,600
alright let's try to open a web browser

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,290
that's also very hard to do Mac you know

188
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't get along that well finder yes I

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,440
don't even care which ok ok yes that's

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,830
fine

191
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,430
and so might be yes yes I do but

192
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,040
so you just okay like this I don't use

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,010
Mac's sorry all right hold on yes that

194
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:49,650
would be hard too there's a learning

195
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,939
curve I'm I'm doing better

196
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,240
alright so I'm gonna take you now to our

197
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,740
admin interface for a radical to our

198
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,800
platform where you can do tons of things

199
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,839
but I wanna be demonstrating most of

200
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,760
them today seeing how we're very short

201
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,410
on time but we'll see some parts for our

202
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:23,640
demo so let me just lock us in look at

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,089
me go

204
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,460
yes I can hear the French people

205
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,300
snickering I can that's alright that's

206
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,900
good

207
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,160
humor is good it makes for a more

208
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,280
interesting presentation doesn't it

209
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,660
alright how do you enlarge this window

210
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:59,890
alright oh wow look at that they are

211
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:06,730
from is chrome installed here no Chrome

212
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:22,300
or Firefox maybe that'd be nice - here

213
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,449
we are

214
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,639
it's very insistent about safari isn't

215
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,579
it it's like give it the try give it a

216
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,469
try you want Safari I know you do

217
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,839
that's are often come I'm capable of

218
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,620
thought you're faster there all right

219
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,639
let's do it again

220
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,060
what's we da what can't it be worry

221
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:11,949
where it should be it's a good thing I

222
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,959
have a simple password for this one all

223
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,199
right okay here we are

224
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:35,529
good so let's manage our medium this is

225
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,730
so fun it's so much fun

226
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,600
[Laughter]

227
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,699
it's amusing it's true all right

228
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:56,239
look at it go first it said no then he

229
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,660
said yes

230
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,489
all right good enough so um we've set up

231
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,290
nginx and we've looked at the

232
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,600
configuration we have two tasks to

233
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,850
finish now one of them is to create the

234
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,920
Couture entry for integration between

235
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,769
Kaltura and the nginx RTP model and the

236
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,679
other is the string and then if we have

237
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,839
time maybe we'd like to actually play

238
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,399
something I don't know it's not that

239
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,339
important I suppose but I think it might

240
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,119
it might add something so let's create a

241
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:42,139
new entry seems that can't navigate

242
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,660
forward for some reason see there are

243
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,129
more taps over there but they're not

244
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,779
visible oh here we are you are there we

245
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:51,230
go

246
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,110
see that's a learning curve all right so

247
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,230
live stream entry we'll give it a name

248
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,049
let's do for them too that's just on

249
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,089
just a descriptive name it doesn't

250
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:06,799
really have any bearings over the

251
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,319
process and let's say manual

252
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:13,759
live-streaming no Akamai and here we

253
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:21,009
just need to put in a URL for our nginx

254
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:26,839
play that had the wisdom to do this so

255
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,860
that I could copy paste

256
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,539
which may be made truth to be harder on

257
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:44,789
Mac but we'll try look at that that's

258
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:48,569
amazing all right so what have we here

259
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,199
this is the IP for the nginx server as

260
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,449
we said streaming would be done over

261
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,969
rtmp but clay but would be done over

262
00:14:56,969 --> 00:15:00,929
HTTP using HLS so we'll say this is the

263
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,009
IP or port is currently 88 and this is

264
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,589
the path which corresponds if you look

265
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:17,339
at the configuration here there we go

266
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:29,279
there we go okay so this is the the HLS

267
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,419
me right

268
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,819
so segments fragments and gnaw and the

269
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,469
manifest would be kept here we'll see a

270
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:37,439
sample of what it looks like so this is

271
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,959
part of the path and this is the

272
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,029
manifest for it which our player will

273
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,029
require in order to playback that's it

274
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,529
that's all the parameters you should

275
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,449
require then you do create large stream

276
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,219
and then you navigate back maybe warp

277
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,139
this time here we are

278
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:08,299
and we'll see a new entry here maybe

279
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,940
I'm trying to navigate to the other

280
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,740
columns and apparently the technique I

281
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,930
found before it doesn't work with this

282
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:37,120
amazing all right now I need to go to

283
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,660
the other side let's okay here we are

284
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,300
let's choose one of our new players good

285
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,770
and we're ready to stream now seeing how

286
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,310
will be using ffmpeg from CLI we're

287
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,230
actually able to stream from the server

288
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,500
itself onto itself which is nice so

289
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,800
let's do it you should already have the

290
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,490
command in my history alright that's

291
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,859
fine

292
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,859
nevermind

293
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,539
say no this command is also in the

294
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:27,020
presentation basically it's rather

295
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,340
simple ffmpeg - re - I then the path to

296
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,720
the video you'd like to swim a few other

297
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,440
FM flags here and then the rtmp URL for

298
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,820
the nginx simply enough it's wrong it

299
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,450
look like though no I'll only be able to

300
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,940
open another tab maybe we can look at

301
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:06,799
the contents - so that'd be a command T

302
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,190
done Oh much easier all right let's just

303
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,330
say to do the same place

304
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,540
almost

305
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,660
okay so we should be seen fragments now

306
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,640
let's take a look

307
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,440
so VAR TMP hls here we are look at those

308
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:57,620
people all right where's the asterisks

309
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,230
okay okay so we've got the manifest and

310
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,490
we've got the fragments if you're

311
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,290
curious about what the manifest looks

312
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:19,940
like it's a very simple format alright

313
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,360
so text file fragments and that's pretty

314
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,330
much it and now let's have a look at the

315
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,330
player I've also noticed in my ffmpeg

316
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,360
command instead of saying fosston one I

317
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,780
said force them so instead of looking at

318
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,230
this entry let's look at this one

319
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,130
alright

320
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,950
[Music]

321
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,239
this is married with children it's a

322
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,980
very nice it come from the nineties

323
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:15,879
mostly worn born be careful all right

324
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,830
and of course you can operate fullscreen

325
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:26,470
if you'd like some humor is always good

326
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,789
and that's pretty much the way works so

327
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:33,279
if there are questions I'd like to take

328
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:56,830
them down so that's a good question you

329
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,330
can connect I'm sorry so the question

330
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,669
was rather all the fragments are removed

331
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,739
from the server or rather you can go

332
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,570
back and forth is that correct

333
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,850
so the answer is that's configurable via

334
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,210
the rtmp model directives there are a

335
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,919
lot of directives that I recommend you

336
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,109
take a look at and in the presentation

337
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,629
you'll find a link to them so you can

338
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,460
decide whether or not you'd like to keep

339
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,929
the old fragments so that you can go

340
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,519
back and forth or rather you like to

341
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:30,210
discard them other questions

342
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,070
right so first of all this is not my

343
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,590
model the presentation actually makes

344
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,779
that quite clear this is not resource

345
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,179
modeled by someone else a very nice

346
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,889
person who has an open source project

347
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,889
Couture the Couture portion is what is

348
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:56,139
the company I work for and I do the

349
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,909
integrations in the packaging of Deb's

350
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,309
and rpms and so forth the model itself

351
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:01,409
is not mine

352
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:04,239
let's if we look at the presentation for

353
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,269
a moment

354
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm just keeping forward alright so

355
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,590
these are the people so the guy that

356
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,509
maintains and started this project the

357
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:23,739
RTMP model is Romina and if you look at

358
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:26,409
the appendix you'll find links to

359
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,039
everything

360
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,349
both stuff that I'm responsible for

361
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,499
other cultural resources his project of

362
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,399
course nginx and so forth but back to

363
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,239
your question as to the advantages so

364
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:42,220
there are a few other alternatives we

365
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,989
also have setups with vlogs are for

366
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,229
example and whilst wowza is a well-known

367
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,629
player in the industry and a continent

368
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,440
of products don't work they're not open

369
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,559
so if you need a very fast configuration

370
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,440
or a TMP solution that's open I would

371
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,539
certainly recommend this one for us it

372
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,820
was a no-brainer because we also have

373
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,190
other integrations and models that use

374
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,249
the nginx and so because of the VOD

375
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,019
model for example which is something

376
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,059
that we do maintain in-house and a

377
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,820
project that we did start in-house we

378
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,489
already had nginx in all our deployments

379
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,889
so for us there was no brainer to make

380
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:23,289
that choice there are other solutions

381
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,690
and some of them are also open with our

382
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,929
TMP if you want to use WebRTC for

383
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,909
example their allotment there are many

384
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,919
others and we've actually seen quite a

385
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,499
few now sessions about them one was

386
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,399
media soup and I've seen a few others so

387
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,659
there are definitely other open

388
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:42,730
alternatives but I've found by

389
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,539
researching but if you want rtmp this is

390
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:47,360
probably the

391
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,970
best shot list was for us I mean every

392
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,679
project has different considerations

393
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,960
naturally but for us this was a very

394
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:03,830
good choice um well you know latency is

395
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,690
always a problem right I mean everyone

396
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,059
here is latency there is pop up like

397
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,120
this because it's a very common problem

398
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,690
that depends on how you define very low

399
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,640
latency how would you define that in

400
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,650
less than a second of I frankly haven't

401
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,540
seen anyone who's managed to get there

402
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,850
oh I'll be happy to see it then I mean

403
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,480
it sounds very nice but I haven't seen

404
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,780
it yet thank you for joining

405
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:45,480
[Applause]
