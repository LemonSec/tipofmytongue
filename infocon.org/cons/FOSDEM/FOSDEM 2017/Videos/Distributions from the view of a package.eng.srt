1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,230
hi so I'm here to talk to you about the

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,030
distributions from the view of a package

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,760
where if you are the upstream package

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,939
owner or package maintainer what it is

5
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:20,160
like to work with distributions so so

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,810
who here works on a distribution Wow who

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,010
here works as an upstream package okay

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,229
so some of you also have similar

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,660
experience as possibly with working with

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,260
these distributions for about six months

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,319
I've been at the CTO office at Percona

12
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,839
and percona does all forms of MySQL and

13
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,899
MongoDB and you know we make all these

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,789
open-source tools and I 100% of

15
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,460
obviously open-source and then before

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,960
that I was on the founding team of Marie

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,649
de servir

18
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,109
I left because they stopped making open

19
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,859
source software so first and foremost

20
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,929
I'd like to say thank you very much to

21
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,809
all the packagers because you do a

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,310
wonderful job we make software and if we

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,830
don't get them into distributions or and

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,210
distributions mean a lot of things

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,310
nowadays including you know docker

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,140
images and so forth we don't actually

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,990
get adoption adoption is crucial first

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,810
cause you do wanting to make better

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,540
software this is only then will we know

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,940
if there are bugs or you know we did

31
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,490
something silly and so forth so I'm

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,020
gonna talk to you a lot about my

33
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,060
experiences with the MySQL ecosystem

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,760
because I've spent a lot of fairly long

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,060
time on the MySQL ecosystem in fact this

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,560
gentleman here lines has also spent

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,030
quite a bit of time at the MySQL

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,310
ecosystem though he he left us maybe

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,770
five years ago or seven years ago yeah

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,590
so MySQL has been around now for 22

41
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,320
years it's pretty old software how do

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
you use MySQL okay so the rest of you

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,950
use it I don't want to admit you using

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,250
it right

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,340
so my school is old I mean it started

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,530
you know in 1986 would uni rag and you

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,690
know it was just a text you I to an item

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,090
data store you had very simple roles

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,019
within two discs

50
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,300
just then you add indexes on top of that

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,890
so you have these my eyes I'm and form

52
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,780
files frm files which is form to enter

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,760
data and all these all of this is

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
changing as MySQL it comes alive right

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,049
form files are going away there'll be no

56
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,190
more frm files

57
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,540
don't be SDI files inside of you know in

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,569
DB and there is also JSON so that's like

59
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,540
a huge positive as well so no more forum

60
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,380
files for corner server also been around

61
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,260
for a fairly long time as a company it's

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,269
been around 10 years service now nine

63
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,360
years old Murray DB seven years old you

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
know February first was its release

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,310
first ever release we've also seen

66
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,860
things like web scale crop up and if

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,299
you're interested in some of the people

68
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,130
who made web scale there at the MySQL

69
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,140
dev room right after this talk

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,880
not that I'm telling you to move yeah

71
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,310
and what doesn't really exist nowadays

72
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,560
because that was the idea of having a

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,920
consortium of people to work on making

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,109
my scale better for people like Google

75
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,030
and Facebook and Twitter and so forth

76
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,910
because upstream being Oracle weren't so

77
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,730
so kind in terms of accepting patches

78
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,319
without signing the Oracle contributor

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,950
agreement MySQL for what it's worth

80
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,019
didn't start off as GPL software it only

81
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,519
became GPL in 2000 and you know more

82
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,750
often than not you may have some

83
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,549
embedded device so I'm still working

84
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,150
from from those days running 323 GA it's

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,040
still one of the most popular all the

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,250
distributions of MySQL around you

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,739
shouldn't use it really then there are a

88
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,049
whole bunch of other for or releases and

89
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,750
for one and so forth but it is very well

90
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,489
worth noting that it was around the time

91
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,709
MySQL became GPL that the software

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,260
license for the client connector changed

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,130
from LGPL which is the lesser general

94
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,410
public license to the GPL which meant

95
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,880
that if you were going to embed it now

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,500
you'd have to get a license exception

97
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,260
and

98
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,760
took a while before we even got

99
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,170
something known as the false lashes

100
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,029
exception because and the reason for

101
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,980
slicin significant came about was

102
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,140
largely because distributions didn't

103
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,540
want to touch my SQL that the new MySQL

104
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,370
with a ten-foot pole they were worried

105
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,360
about linking say PHP or Perl against

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,640
the GPL Lib MySQL client which would

107
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,080
then possibly mean that those

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,670
applications would also have to become

109
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,750
GPL so the false license exception came

110
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,000
about and of course my ice cube root of

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,420
Fame around the 90s during even the web

112
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,760
1.0 days largely because of replication

113
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,230
and scale out so you'd have you know

114
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,240
what famous website like slash dog do

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
people still read that yes but I don't

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,910
know if anyone still reads it though

117
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,910
no son around 20 years ago actually and

118
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,790
they were big mysql users and probably

119
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,360
still are so talk a little bit about

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,790
licenses and license exceptions you know

121
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't know how many of you remember

122
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,830
alan cox big big guy in the linux world

123
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,180
and still is and he was also very adept

124
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,850
with licensing as well

125
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,900
mysql changing the client libraries from

126
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,480
LGPL which made my SQL and stuff like

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,760
PHP infeasible this could have hurt my

128
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,530
scale adoption had there not been a

129
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,540
false exception and a lot of other

130
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,550
people around this time the Fedora

131
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,770
project was also starting and Fedora was

132
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,780
like no we don't really want to include

133
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,290
a new MySQL and it wasn't me

134
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,600
then did you get a false license

135
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,240
exception and this is what Richard

136
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,460
Stallman himself refers to as parallel

137
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,000
licensing and why does MySQL need to

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,650
have this parallel license or a dual

139
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,200
license very simple back then if you

140
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,420
were going to embed MySQL connector and

141
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,890
you wanted to use it for commercial

142
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,230
applications say you know you were a

143
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,680
hardware manufacturer making a router

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,610
back then there were even phone

145
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,610
companies doing it and even like

146
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,630
software like Photoshop even so

147
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,910
generally the idea is

148
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,100
they need to pay a license fee but for

149
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,080
software it doesn't need to pay a light

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,850
with any any license fee hence the force

151
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,270
exception did you ever question

152
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,290
exception is different from the dual

153
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,560
license yes of course the terms of the

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,540
GPL yes yes but yeah what we need to

155
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,160
also talk about the dual license because

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,900
we need to we needed a way to make

157
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,630
revenue and that was really why there

158
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,170
was a dual license and the false license

159
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,780
exception allowed MySQL connectors to

160
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,910
actually finally go into the

161
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,070
distributions and why is this important

162
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,250
right it like if you if you want to move

163
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,420
software forward

164
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,970
you don't really change the old releases

165
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,440
you keep on changing the new client

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,750
libraries to make it better and if the

167
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,100
distributions don't ship the newer

168
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,960
client libraries you're actually hurt

169
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,880
because whatever cool stuff you have in

170
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,350
the server that the new client library

171
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,430
needs to access people can't use so this

172
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,890
was was a crucial decision to make a

173
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,150
license exception so that it gets

174
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,550
shipped but we still continued on with

175
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,650
the dual license and we actually MySQL

176
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,960
till today has dual license for what it

177
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,210
is worth but this first exception still

178
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,330
is is available on the on the website

179
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,070
hasn't changed since 2012 distributions

180
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,710
are also very interesting because every

181
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,140
time you make a new release of a client

182
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,460
library you have to make sure the

183
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,110
application binary interface doesn't

184
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,760
break because you have to then rebuild

185
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,860
possibly hundreds of packages that link

186
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,800
against it and this this is an example

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,150
from 2006 but the same example happens

188
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,850
in 2016 when Debian for example is

189
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,430
replacing MySQL with Maria DB and

190
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,530
everything has to be rebuilt against

191
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,810
liber8 you be client in fact this move

192
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,000
is happening right now so if you join

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,190
the packaged MySQL mayn't list is

194
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,890
anybody on that it's a wonderful mailing

195
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,930
list because well now it gets such high

196
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,150
traffic I mean people are complaining

197
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,070
that you know Maria DB is not dropping

198
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,530
Maria bees is breaking their software

199
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,860
and we're learning a lot of new things

200
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,470
we didn't know because Debian is clearly

201
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,340
diverse so they don't like to rebuild

202
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,980
hundreds of packages and obviously avi

203
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,650
should never break this came from the

204
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,180
packages mailing list now the package is

205
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,610
mailing list for MySQL unfortunately is

206
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,400
still fairly is kind of dead as is the

207
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,260
internals mailing list but this is

208
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,120
something that even distributions and

209
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,070
people who are making packages actually

210
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,380
complain about because they need a place

211
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,450
to discuss things with the upstream

212
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,190
developers and if the option developers

213
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,160
don't provide that this is bad from from

214
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,470
a distribution standpoint as well so

215
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,870
Murray DB for example has its own

216
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,220
packages mailing lists where it tells

217
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,560
you okay you that's gonna be a new

218
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,510
release and it's it's very similar with

219
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,140
with percona and MySQL currently is more

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,910
like here we're gonna drop something on

221
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,160
you and this is the hole we're going to

222
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,080
drop something on you usually like when

223
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,200
there's CVS and so forth and that

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
typically happens at least once every

225
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,160
three months because Oracle has what is

226
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,920
known as a critical patch update day

227
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,200
once every three months and then you get

228
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,830
a new new release and MySQL itself gets

229
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,240
released once every two months now when

230
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,310
it comes to speed of releases I would

231
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,080
say Fedora and it won't too rarely

232
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,330
primed this nine-month distribution

233
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,310
cycle maybe even six months six to nine

234
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,560
months they release very quickly now

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,290
database software a little bit more

236
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,990
complex than than this and the idea was

237
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,730
to also make you know nine-month

238
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,940
releases but the reality is we make 24

239
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,380
month releases and this is across the

240
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,030
board for MySQL and MariaDB as well and

241
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,970
the real problem we face as upstream is

242
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,580
that if we make a release today and you

243
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,410
ship something you're not shipping

244
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,330
something that is possibly outdated for

245
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,260
a very long time and we get and we make

246
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,030
new feature new feature fixes in the

247
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,100
next release which people don't get and

248
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,530
Red Hat has found sort of a workaround

249
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,660
for this they have what is known as

250
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,010
software collection sorry

251
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,250
SEL which sort of actually helps in this

252
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,520
in this scenario but this the speed and

253
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,570
velocity

254
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,040
doesn't actually work out very well for

255
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,570
upstream people now if you take a

256
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,120
distribution like rel or aura bun to

257
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
which has low or even Susa which has

258
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,030
long enterprise support you now have to

259
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,680
support the software for the lifetime of

260
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,740
the distribution so imagine if you take

261
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,920
if you've taken two year old software

262
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,660
package did and now you tell us hey

263
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,490
you've got to support this one for

264
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,740
another eight years that's ten years of

265
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,270
supporting software that we really

266
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,890
didn't want to support more than five

267
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,270
years and this is actually a real life

268
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,670
problem so again well seven ships you

269
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,690
know Maria DB server five five and the

270
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,260
reality is rel seven will only and and

271
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,300
its first level of supports I think of

272
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,890
the quarter for 2020 and y5 was released

273
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,340
in you know 2014 which is longer than

274
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,870
anyone wants the support and this is

275
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,910
again very true from even from a

276
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,230
Patronus standpoint where we need to

277
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,570
start thinking about deprecating modules

278
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,940
inside so if you want to deprecate an

279
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,200
engine even we have to think very

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,630
carefully about how long this this is

281
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,970
gonna take we do realize what ships and

282
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,950
releases matters and this is the this is

283
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,570
amazing thing you get about you know

284
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,600
statistics or whatever little statistics

285
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,030
we get out of popcorn which debian does

286
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,180
provide is that what is the default

287
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,050
really does get used a lot because more

288
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,730
often than not people just say i want to

289
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,430
install wordpress wordpress pulls in

290
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,630
mysql and people don't care that they're

291
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,160
running mysql I just care that they're

292
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,230
running WordPress and this is true even

293
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,020
for you know a conadi and and so forth

294
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,520
and you know you'll see that - ql5 one

295
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,440
is really popular I believe I took this

296
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,540
out actually from a boot - why is it

297
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,240
popular because boon - LTS releases are

298
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,130
more popular than every other boon to

299
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,580
release that comes out mysql 5.1 has

300
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,150
been end-of-life for a very long time

301
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,180
but a lot of people are using it so they

302
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,930
are using it

303
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,540
potentially lots of security holes and

304
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,980
they don't know it

305
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,610
distributions can make something make

306
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,100
make upstreams life a lot easier by

307
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,260
giving the statistics distribution

308
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,060
statistics are extremely sparse if we

309
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,190
look at fedora and openSUSE they used to

310
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,529
have statistics several years ago but

311
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,450
they don't have even even simple things

312
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,920
like mera statistics of how many people

313
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,709
full downloads we we do not get so

314
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,820
statistics extremely sparse we are we

315
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,529
are getting some stats out of things

316
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,209
like Debian and Ubuntu is popcorn but

317
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,430
I'm sure no one in this room runs

318
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,700
popcorn right yeah you can't rely on

319
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,020
12-car it's like what yeah but it's fake

320
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,200
news yes but in the absence of real news

321
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,770
fake news will suffice

322
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,620
and this is especially important for

323
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,690
it's also important for MySQL and

324
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,670
percona

325
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,080
but it is extremely important for

326
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,330
MariaDB server because it is a

327
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,279
venture-backed company and you've got to

328
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,110
impress the venture capitalists every

329
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,360
month you got to say look we we got

330
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,339
extra downloads it's so good

331
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,370
so statistics like Doppler and yuju they

332
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,589
actually give you statistics kind of

333
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,839
useful but we need more stats and also

334
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,670
when you hear you know random codes like

335
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,380
this and this this I picked out from the

336
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,360
Murray ADB press release they say they

337
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,970
have a 12 million strong community but

338
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,040
then if you look at phone home data and

339
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,279
I see lens grimacing and you look at the

340
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,110
phone home data because Murray DB server

341
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,330
actually includes little phone home

342
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,760
think to report what is being used in

343
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,220
the server it is off by default no one

344
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,070
turns it on and if you if you believe

345
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,079
twelve million and you look at the phone

346
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,329
home data which I picked in December of

347
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,490
2016 you've only got 12 a little over

348
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,680
12,000 users so is it 12 million or

349
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,920
twelve thousand users hmm that's a huge

350
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,579
huge difference in numbers so again

351
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,110
possibilities are fake news

352
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,700
and then of course we think about

353
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,520
support years the beauty of Linux is

354
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,820
that we have so many distributions but

355
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,120
if you are upstream you really can you

356
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,100
really do care more about bugs that are

357
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,710
reported in SE rel and you know Debian

358
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,490
and fedora

359
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,740
as opposed to bugs reported in something

360
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,620
like ghost bsd there there definitely

361
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,960
tears if we don't tell you but we we

362
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,590
have them internally and there's some

363
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,330
distribution vendors also do end up

364
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,460
getting a like a level three support

365
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,640
agreement with various top streams to

366
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,410
make sure that those bugs get fixed and

367
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,810
that's actually quite useful database

368
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,220
servers are like a distribution

369
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,200
themselves especially when they're like

370
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,790
in the MySQL ecosystem because we

371
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,290
support storage engines we support

372
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,270
plugins and in fact if you do a show

373
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,360
plugins on you know random se murió DB

374
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,010
you might find a hundred thirty plugins

375
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,630
or something available for you and we

376
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,180
realize things like when you require

377
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,510
malloc libraries like like je malloc for

378
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,220
at one stage you didn't actually work on

379
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,470
FreeBSD this actually takes work around

380
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,240
because otherwise this engine stops

381
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,370
working on that platform and we need to

382
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,000
care about all platforms live judy is

383
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,280
not provided in in pretty much any

384
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,510
distribution and this prevents an open

385
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,210
oq graph which is a graphic engine for

386
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,290
memory ADB and MySQL to not work and

387
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,360
this now means we have to provide lib

388
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
Judy packages which that makes things

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,290
extremely complex some people run power8

390
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,990
for example and extra backup works

391
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,870
wonderfully well on x86 but not so on on

392
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,660
power aids and they're a whole bunch of

393
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,880
things like what happens when the server

394
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,460
because Murray DB server now includes

395
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,860
Galera cluster requires all these other

396
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,369
tools like IP route and arcing and in

397
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,619
some instances now it's pulling this and

398
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,060
people go and they're updating from

399
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,250
Maria DB server ten zero to ten one they

400
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,800
go why is Maria DB asking for all this

401
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,849
this is insane

402
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,980
also another very important thing that

403
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,919
you know would be nice if we got fixed

404
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,349
from a distribution standpoint is when

405
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,270
we go out for consulting gigs sometimes

406
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,090
we encounter people that say look we

407
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,380
need to have all these packages

408
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,530
installed but we will not allow you to

409
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,980
get on the internet now rpm can do

410
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,309
dependency resolution D package we find

411
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,320
we find it really really hard to deal

412
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,910
with resolving dependencies when you're

413
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,679
offline this needs fixing see pani when

414
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,270
you have mini Sipan you can take things

415
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,280
offline in the my SQL where we love

416
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,500
Sipan we love Sipan and pearl a lot so

417
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,789
when it comes to bugs we obviously

418
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,010
encourage regular communication via

419
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,659
mailing lists but then what happens if

420
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,220
your upstream is MySQL and the mailing

421
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,470
list is quiet then you go to other

422
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,480
mailing lists like the Murray DB list on

423
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
the percona list which is actually gets

424
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,210
a lot of traffic

425
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,880
sometimes bog system CCS that's the best

426
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,740
thing we can get right getting CCD on

427
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,600
bugs so that we know that there's a bug

428
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
if you don't tell us a bug we will never

429
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,190
know there is no real clear dashboard I

430
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,990
think Launchpad was supposed to be this

431
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,090
dashboard that actually amalgamated

432
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,580
everything together but that that was

433
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,620
the dream but reality is we don't we

434
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,490
don't see that today and yeah we also

435
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,340
really don't get bugs that you you see

436
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,440
in distributions report upstream which

437
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,640
is actually a real problem for us

438
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,620
because we we don't know what we don't

439
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,260
know we've mitigated all of this

440
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,850
distribution problems by also making our

441
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,860
own packages and telling and encouraging

442
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,049
people to bypass distributions and use

443
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,840
our own packages and MySQL for one is

444
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,789
very happy that this happened because

445
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,860
now they have these stats of how many

446
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,750
people are using their repositories and

447
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,409
it's it's a huge number which they don't

448
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:08,530
release

449
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,270
[Laughter]

450
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,490
and this is again very true with percona

451
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,679
service Oprah : a server doesn't even

452
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,290
follow the mirror mirror method so we

453
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,929
actually track 100% of our downloads so

454
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,880
we can tell you yes we have three

455
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,710
million downloads because that came

456
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,660
through our system of course we don't

457
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,940
know if it can't you know if it comes by

458
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,500
a distribution but we know what comes

459
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,390
from our system and ready to be server

460
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,370
it's it's all through mirrors as well so

461
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,160
again we don't have a really good number

462
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,480
and of course our packages tend to have

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,070
additional things as well right you know

464
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,929
maybe more engines more plugins these

465
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:43,220
are things that sometimes distributions

466
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,340
just choose not to build and that there

467
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,050
are good reasons why maybe there's no

468
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,280
reason to do it

469
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,990
or maybe there is no reason to want to

470
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,940
support other engines just okay taking a

471
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,179
quick look at you know the debian 5 site

472
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,120
as well as the fedora pride set we still

473
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,700
don't have equivalence in terms of you

474
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,220
know no patch that no patches in

475
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,170
distributions this is always going to

476
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,260
happen and you know inside of Debian for

477
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,179
example we have patches that we see for

478
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,890
the MySQL package to make it work on

479
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,490
things like herd and K FreeBSD which

480
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,309
which apparently does matter but then we

481
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,440
also if I go go looking at patches

482
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,570
really closely sometimes we get you know

483
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,410
really silly patches which is just just

484
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,630
fixing English and there's no reason to

485
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,640
to fix English in your package that you

486
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,020
should just fit you just report this

487
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,210
upstream and get it fixed I you don't

488
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,090
have to run a patch to fix a spelling

489
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,220
error I mean we we try to spell properly

490
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,220
but we fail sometimes I I spent a long

491
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,650
time I saw I saw we saw really being in

492
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,230
2009 and right up until 2016 I spent

493
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,290
time focusing on replacing MySQL with

494
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,440
Maria DB server in distributions and the

495
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,559
journey started in November of 2010 so

496
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,360
maybe about eight or nine months after

497
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
our first release it has progressed

498
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,550
tremendously into enterprise

499
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,710
distributions and so forth and debian

500
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,929
just starts the journey for 10-1 which

501
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,910
is why said the Debian MySQL package

502
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,190
maintainer is mailing list is an awesome

503
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,840
place to be now because you can see lots

504
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,510
of bugs lots of people complaining if

505
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,590
you like the son of drum

506
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,100
in your life it's as well as being there

507
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,260
but it's also really a statement to the

508
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,179
amount of architectures and amount of

509
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,400
packages Debian has we never saw this

510
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,460
kind of pushback from fedora we totally

511
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,080
see this from Debian because they'll

512
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,539
tell you stuff on you know random weird

513
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,400
Hardware that doesn't even run Linux

514
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,070
kernels apparently yeah so I would say

515
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,929
this this goal would probably be

516
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,120
complete in 2017 so it would take it

517
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,070
would take in seven years whereas if you

518
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,250
look at LibreOffice LibreOffice replaced

519
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,779
OpenOffice and pretty much everything

520
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,250
much quicker and you know that's

521
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,899
probably because LibreOffice was

522
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,250
actually getting developed an OpenOffice

523
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,039
wasn't in this case all three servers

524
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,570
are getting developed and they're all

525
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,730
getting better that's true it's end-user

526
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:28,159
software already shipping that yes it

527
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,510
was much it was much easier for them so

528
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,580
this is a note March 23rd 2016 where the

529
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,590
Debian release team decided to make

530
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,169
Maria DB the new default and as I said

531
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,990
this is still an ongoing thing now in

532
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,320
February of 2017 but that's also a

533
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,700
testament to how long it takes for

534
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,279
Debian to make a release it's it's

535
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,700
improved though I guess and why why did

536
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,770
that bin choose to switch to Maria DB

537
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,960
back then it made a lot of sense because

538
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,250
there were things like you know test

539
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,230
cases were were not being published and

540
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,510
Debian wanted security information

541
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,820
published Debian has actually ejected

542
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,279
things like elasticsearch out of the

543
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,409
repository as well because they don't

544
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:16,610
get security updates you know we add one

545
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,230
stage that will man pages silence

546
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,029
silence assignment being realized it's

547
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,679
away from a GPL but this was actually

548
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,950
just a bug that was was fixed shortly

549
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,909
thereafter and I guess the most

550
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,799
important thing was security security

551
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,470
security security and nowadays nobody

552
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,799
really talks much about it but it's

553
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,150
repeatedly that

554
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,440
you know Maria we would be a little bit

555
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,010
more open with security than say MySQL

556
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,910
but this also poses a problem for users

557
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,280
a problem unlike what you'd get inside

558
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,920
of say LibreOffice and OpenOffice in the

559
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,610
sense that Murray server is now not

560
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,240
compatible with MySQL it was compatible

561
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,540
for quite some time but it is not

562
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,700
compatible and this creates real-life

563
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,410
problems that affect users users are

564
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,300
saying things like how come I can't use

565
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,760
JSON functionality when I expect it to

566
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,290
just work I'm reading this article and

567
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,600
Internet but my might but what is saying

568
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,850
it's MySQL which is really more ADB

569
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,250
doesn't provide the functionality they

570
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,840
get angry and they're going to get angry

571
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,530
at you

572
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,230
not not upstream so if you if your

573
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,630
distribution beware for this sort of

574
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,380
thing so yeah bunch of missing features

575
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,670
bunch of different features of the on

576
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,870
these formats are changed also what

577
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,180
happens when upstream says hey we don't

578
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,470
have enough time to work at something

579
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,120
you can't just you know orphan our

580
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,250
packages in immediately we need to know

581
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,390
and so on so in conclusion I'd like to

582
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,400
say yeah distribution methods definitely

583
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,280
evolve you know even someone like Mark

584
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,780
Shuttleworth keeps on trying to make new

585
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,180
evolutions with snap for example but a

586
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,130
product without any distribution will

587
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,200
definitely hurt its adoption potential

588
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,760
oh and if you happen to run MySQL five

589
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,320
seven you will now see a warning like

590
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,840
this but this warning is the tip of the

591
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,420
iceberg thank you for listening

592
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,500
do you have any questions

593
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,440
[Applause]

594
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,690
okay one question if anyone has a

595
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:42,779
question yes the question is problems

596
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,399
with offline install so sometimes in

597
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,049
some environments they say you can't get

598
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,130
access to the Internet so you have to

599
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,380
download all these packages yourself

600
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,440
manually and then install them rpm you

601
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,200
can do like dependency resolution even

602
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,870
when you're offline with young or what

603
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,059
the new tool but you can't do that with

604
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,559
deep package the package doesn't do

605
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,210
depends resolutions you have to install

606
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,309
packages like one by one in the correct

607
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:25,710
order whether this is a complaint we got

608
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,110
from consultants it's also not a very

609
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,639
common scenario where they tell you you

610
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,100
can't work offline that you must work

611
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,789
offline yes

612
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,739
[Applause]
