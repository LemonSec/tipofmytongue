of my sequel TVA so I start my career

seven years of Delta programming and

only to a program

00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:58,680
you put your code into some kind of

young mirrors and mine we want to keep

17
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,530
it private and inside our company

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,730
premises and all of these things

19
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,389
whatever your requirements are but in

20
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,420
reality we're just doing the same work I

21
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,970
don't particularly like doing work other

22
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,850
people do so started thinking about this

23
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,970
new one centralized logging is to mean

24
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,450
something that you have to think about

25
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,410
34th only see the larger your the

26
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,580
infrastructure that you have to manage

27
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,080
the more you kind of think about these

28
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,960
things but let's say some 100 servers

29
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,490
you don't really want to think about

30
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,380
what do I need to do to get something so

31
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,910
we saw these problems in practice

32
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,610
because a company we do a consulting so

33
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,200
we go from customer to customer and

doing projects with companies new song

36
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,890
over and over doing the same thing we

37
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,850
started thinking about okay what if we

38
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,560
come up with a stack of these tools that

39
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,540
we keep using over and over we convince

40
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,080
our clients to use that convinces

41
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,650
amazing why they shouldn't use that

42
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,710
something else and we work on making any

43
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,120
well integrated solutions for the basic

44
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,940
infrastructure manage and so what is the

45
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,170
idea of before before October 4th so the

46
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,340
idea is that we are using puppet

47
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,710
together a bunch of other tools in this

48
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,590
case we have because we're managing our

49
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,200
circular stop it

50
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,780
we are also some kind of version

51
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,440
controls

52
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,720
lots of companies unfortunately are

53
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,400
still scared of not on-premise so get

54
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,159
that it seems to be a good

55
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,599
they were making really awesome software

56
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,849
really quickly you know that's wrong

57
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:36,159
between but for those who didn't know

58
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,309
there was no they managed to drop their

59
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,499
production database and all of their

60
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:44,379
applied backup sources were not working

61
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,719
so they had a bit of a few sleepless

62
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:52,379
night anyway all privates give out

63
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,019
compared with the CIT containers

64
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,360
integration solution from get that works

65
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,369
really well I have a section about get

66
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,469
that sea-ice tomorrow morning and ten

67
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,389
minutes eleven and investing animations

68
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,779
then we have server monitoring where we

69
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,629
chose my finger I think it is originally

70
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,069
was an avi alone by now but you single

71
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:24,219
line now your code anymore but it seems

72
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,009
to be a quite a popular server

73
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,259
monitoring tool then centralized logging

74
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,050
we have the elf sec I think they are

75
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,999
trying to get us to call it something

76
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,379
else but I think that everybody right

77
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,619
now know that the outside elasticsearch

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:45,339
we added Ravana with that I'll show you

in a minute and on the front equality to

which logs to long time and unless one

communication is the source of many

problems in many of our companies

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,880
especially as they grow larger

surprising amount of people have not

black whatever bandwagon matter most is

a nice cost-free easy entry solution

102
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,910
we'll get that going and just creating a

103
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,920
room called engineering that anyone from

104
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,180
anything that's interested in

105
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,220
engineering and joined in do wonders

106
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,370
we've seen this a number of our clients

107
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,339
where all of a sudden people started

108
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,660
communicating before will submit as

109
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,910
tickets to the networking team and you

110
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,290
know you know how this goes

111
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,740
not very nice but so just providing a

112
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,600
little barrier place for people to

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,040
communicate is a quite useful so that's

114
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,880
why chances as a particle we are all

115
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,209
supposed to be experts one or more of

116
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,829
these stomachs so why not share our

117
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,440
knowledge and make things together so

118
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,300
there's an experimental you know the

119
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,779
standard open sort of said how does this

120
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,490
look in a picture this actually made

121
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,320
products but it is very easily in

122
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,899
one-to-one battle to the price so we

123
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,500
have orchestration and provisioning is

124
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,480
puppet in our case I'm sorry at the

125
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,550
bottom there we have your infrastructure

126
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,140
it doesn't really matter what kind of

127
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,760
infrastructure it is op Sarah is the

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,010
part that comes in after you

129
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,100
your operating systems up and running

130
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,120
because you need above an agent

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,010
installed in order to start configuring

132
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,780
something that's kind of come in so you

133
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,710
have your infrastructure and then we use

134
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,940
puppet here in the middle puppet here in

135
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,430
the middle for configuration management

136
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,080
some orchestration we're currently

137
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,330
researching putting Haskell is for the

138
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,050
incorporation part your puppet code is

139
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,750
in version control this is kit laughs

140
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,160
whenever you check something into Burton

141
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,790
control it automatically triggers a

142
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,210
built-in kidnap CI check terrifying in

143
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,550
the eye for instance find the problem it

144
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,170
automatically pauses a message in your

145
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,110
matter most rooms say hey this build is

146
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,640
broken so that everybody who is

147
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,150
interested in and contain we have our

148
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,830
monitoring solution hearing I think

149
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,020
which monitors all the infrastructure

150
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,240
and we have centralized logging

151
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,510
elasticsearch for that so the point is

152
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,240
that all these tools are not made by us

153
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,280
and I don't want to be spending time on

154
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,740
making new tools the point is that we

155
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,950
make these this said integrate

156
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,080
integrated Nicene so that you don't have

157
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,300
to go and spend a ton of time on setting

158
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,140
on a log fashion make sure that it all

159
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,900
along to the right place and at the

160
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:53,360
right time so to have a combination of

161
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
both technologies best practices Holden

162
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,560
sort of software I was considering

163
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,570
putting enterprises back in there

164
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,040
because personally I think it's quite

165
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,130
important that - if you using all the

166
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,920
first

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,989
in a company that's larger than a few

168
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:08,850
people at some point somebody is going

169
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,859
to say I want to pay for support

170
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,819
regardless of whether you think that's a

171
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,569
great idea

172
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,779
studying the reality and therefore we

173
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,809
see that the projects that have some

174
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,480
kind of enterprise backing and generally

175
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
are more successful in the enterprise

176
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,009
environment because you can go out and

177
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:36,419
buy a checkmark a box so we use all

178
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:37,829
these pieces of open software and we

179
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,319
glue them together in a bucket so that

180
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,569
it becomes easier to manage it all I

181
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,119
have a demo after the slides are up but

182
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,220
we have to it's gonna be a bit limited

183
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,509
because the demo is running on my laptop

184
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,809
and this is just a staging well I'll

185
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:57,029
show you as much as I can so basically

186
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:00,350
were milling an abstraction layer that

187
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,449
hides or makes easier all of the things

188
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,329
that you need to do that are not part of

189
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,899
that are not specific to your business

190
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,529
so there's two examples here if you and

191
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,389
you put your new code to get locked it

192
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:17,040
needs to be tested by Kim FCI

193
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,069
and when that goes well or doesn't go

194
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,239
well and over the games you should go

195
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:24,540
there it is standard it doesn't matter

196
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,009
what kind of company you're in or what

197
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,649
you're trying to do it should not be

198
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,939
something you need to think about

199
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:33,269
setting up and so goes for all the other

200
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,369
ideas and you can think of probably a

201
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,549
hundred more I would even say that you

202
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,739
can get just like 50% of all the stuff

203
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,410
that you're doing is actually not

204
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,059
specific or unique to your company think

205
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,369
of it as building packages versus

206
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,499
compiling software the fighting software

207
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,220
was the thing before but then we figured

208
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,400
out of the package management

209
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,890
that could be quite convenient and takes

210
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,930
away a lot of hassle so why not do the

211
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,210
same on operations level that's it

212
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,880
who's before who's gonna be not for if

213
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,690
you want to use it totally fine but with

214
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,090
less than ten servers it doesn't really

215
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,120
make sense because as it stands now with

216
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,710
all of these pieces of software you need

217
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,410
about four to five virtual machines to

218
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,080
run on all of this so if you have less

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,700
than ten servers to manage then you can

220
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,920
wonder whether that overhead actually

221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,280
makes sense non puppet environments if

222
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,100
you're already using chef or Hansel or

223
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,670
salt reconsider everything then probably

224
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,750
computer engineer environment is going

225
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:52,270
to be a lot of cursing and benefit pure

226
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,390
some cloud environments if you're doing

227
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,840
Amazon for instance mean Amazon wait I

228
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,450
call it then Buffett is probably not

229
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,240
your best tool of choice and you can

230
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,730
wonder whether you want to dive into the

231
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,490
world of it'll run and you can do it if

232
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,170
you really want to but I wouldn't say

233
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,300
that that's necessarily better to choice

234
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,510
if you're already a fully implemented an

235
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,340
automated environment is probably also

236
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,700
not very much on the other hand if you

237
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,940
have already used one or more of these

238
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,470
tools so inviting and they were already

239
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,899
using good lat they were already using

240
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,389
nuggets home for monitoring so it wasn't

241
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,100
a very big stretch to start introducing

242
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,540
the new tools one by one until we had

243
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,389
the exact they're completely new

244
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,680
environments that's obviously where it

245
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,849
becomes the most useful

246
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,540
there is nothing yet that makes for an

247
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,040
ideal candidate because then you can get

248
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,689
off with running very very quickly

249
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,750
if you already have skills in one or

250
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,009
more of these tools and your life is

251
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,420
going to be considerably easier because

252
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,240
you don't have to learn a whole bunch of

253
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,230
new technology very quickly the current

254
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,439
state senator is we just release over to

255
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,500
this week which I'm very happy to it was

256
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,699
a wildly in the making but we're there

257
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,379
you can check out healthier calm which

258
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:42,389
will just redirect the new things in

259
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,910
Britain to is that it is easier to get

260
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,160
started so before you have to a whole

261
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,259
bunch of stuff to even check out what it

262
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,410
does now you can just get clone go to

263
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,779
the right directories and call the right

264
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,980
papers up command and wait 45 minutes

265
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,769
because it takes a while for puppet

266
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,439
master using the format and using my

267
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,869
sequel and get that and all of these

268
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,730
things to get new falls but it does work

269
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,959
without the interaction we have started

270
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,390
to move towards smart grammars in

271
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,760
performance as opposed to high run of

272
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,159
you mention it any questions after the

273
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,589
last talk I rise really nice but if you

274
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,449
have large infrastructures it gets

275
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,630
fairly complicated and the other thing

276
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,299
we found is that very often you have

277
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,400
people in your operations team

278
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
especially at

279
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,190
administrators they don't want to learn

280
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,460
how to get the commit home whatever they

281
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,790
just want to make sure that no

282
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,130
application one sided or the lowdown on

283
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,330
the points of the different view around

284
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,580
basic stuff like hasn't hit me and LDAP

285
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:10,570
if you want to use the public based on

286
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,770
fatigue and business stuff that we are

287
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,470
all doing that we shouldn't be specific

288
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:24,130
to our environment address that you want

289
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,800
to begin to log in to get that using how

290
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
that that's not unique for your

291
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,640
environment it's basically the first

292
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,850
version where we have basically all the

293
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,640
tool that we have and now it becomes a

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,920
matter of making it more smart what

295
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,230
where can we add more integration is

296
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,960
more things we're thinking about

297
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,750
Princeton's a refinement that port that

298
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,610
automatically shows groups of servers

299
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,980
and automatically creates graphs when

300
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:06,570
you add new things for the next reasons

301
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,820
so that's the road ahead where was just

302
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,880
in one of the deployments we've enabled

303
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,970
the matter most notifications from the

304
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,010
log session so long stack has a black

305
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,370
API

306
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,570
like avi logs I have a like output so

307
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,890
you can enable a log stash of food for

308
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,799
certain long messages that I say show up

309
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,630
one night gate in your animals channel

310
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,169
very basic stuff but let's say a failed

311
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:42,940
something on you want to know about it

312
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,610
or maybe you don't and that's all so

313
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,450
we're playing around with that more cat

314
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,840
buzz more interactive chat box about

315
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,789
where you can say so we did surf on a

316
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,409
backboard for that server

317
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,620
give me a Cabana URL that automatically

318
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,860
takes me to all of the queries regarding

319
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,010
X why is it that kind of stuff we found

320
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,429
out that the ones that we've done so far

321
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,500
almost everybody wants to use on the

322
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:22,870
site yum repositories not the public or

323
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,830
some other way to make it easier to have

324
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,289
your own package or

325
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,149
and our company has been working on a

326
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,690
factor of a third form and stuff to be

327
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,130
able to terraform into whatever clouds

328
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:48,809
or securities can support one has a nice

329
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:55,179
plugin for our cap backups I'm not sure

330
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:55,590
about

331
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,090
welcome to hear your ideas about that

332
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,730
later if you have them whether backup is

333
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,640
something that are generic enough to

334
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,120
have an opinion about because most

335
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,149
companies that I've seen already have a

336
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,990
certain backup solution in place I don't

337
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:25,029
think that I'm not sure so that is the

338
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,740
road ahead how can you help

339
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,350
first of all just try it out if you want

340
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,480
to bring off the pool SEC I warn you it

341
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,409
takes about well speak about some memory

342
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:39,100
and but there is a vagrants environment

343
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,899
for it so if you go through give that a

344
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,820
little bit of lip balm /op Sierra Hope

345
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,299
Center and then there you can find

346
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:48,669
instructions on how to get it get it

347
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,450
working up and running right now is

348
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,090
hosted on our oldest account get that

349
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,549
and that it's simply because it's still

350
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,409
a very young and small project and it

351
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,559
doesn't make sense yet to have it hosted

352
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,700
on its own

353
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,909
however I would prefer to be couple of

354
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,170
cedar from

355
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,990
I don't we don't intend to ever make

356
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,910
money off of this other than southern

357
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,610
services are we like that but the code

358
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,250
itself will always be because I don't

359
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:28,110
such a project provide very very happily

360
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,240
as this functionality you are very

361
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,730
skilled at sever form please take a look

362
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,260
at what is there now and see if you can

363
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,320
improve it there are some requests for

364
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,180
being able to not use to electrolyze

365
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,330
that can be of use to ABC and said so

366
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,550
let's say that you want to be Splunk

367
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,400
instead of elasticsearch use Nagios

368
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,130
instead of mixing up I want to make that

369
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,220
possible interest circular update our

370
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,200
Twitter account tweeted it gets me I

371
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,070
realized there wasn't one

372
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,770
so the independence full of

373
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,700
conversations with it

374
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,300
we need a website I am NOT a web

375
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,390
developer and so another beam so right

376
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:31,240
now to go to colleges for there was

377
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,460
something else last week but I decided

378
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,630
to have a so horrible this base all of

379
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,370
it so insert any help is welcome unit is

380
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,639
just

381
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:48,139
you like it or you don't like their you

382
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,489
have different ideas or you're doing

383
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:50,809
something similar or maybe work together

384
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:57,649
etc etc very open and then I was going

385
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,850
to use the rest of this time for a demo

386
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,830
however this is going to be a bit more

387
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,940
challenging

388
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:15,379
we'll give it a try hand me what I have

389
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:27,349
done what I have done here is specific

390
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:32,649
implement of the opposite of yes

391
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,799
[Music]

392
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:29,080
I didn't change my yo oh by the way

393
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,159
[Music]

394
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,079
[Music]

395
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,099
[Music]

396
00:26:12,770 --> 00:27:03,810
and so in our it's quite busy if you

397
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,270
want to deploy this in a larger

398
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,530
production environment you can have to

399
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,180
split it up but all the puppet code

400
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,750
makes that my single and then we have

401
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,210
four test machines beanie client boss

402
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,160
client well seven or all things in the

403
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,880
book addressee and is so right now we

404
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,010
have a bunch of them running however

405
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,260
normally you are probably used to

406
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,990
a vagrant file that has the whole

407
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,540
definition of all heads up you won't

408
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,370
find that year what we do is we send

409
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,690
some environment variables that we'll

410
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,550
use somewhere down the line and then

411
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:50,440
here this is the something and then it

412
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,140
would be where you configured with these

413
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,620
victims out of our target and you show

414
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,560
you what author can do is quite nice so

415
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,560
in Oscar you have two main roles Emily a

416
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,500
movie my camels VMs are the actual

417
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,180
machine that you want to configure and

418
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,200
roles is a list of difficult that hpm

419
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,080
can have so we see here into the role

420
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,790
for a pub identify the master and

421
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,870
unimportant a managed hosts for

422
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,260
different machines and different amounts

423
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,440
of memory so all this is done by

424
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,300
assigning this role will host it gets

425
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,870
two gigs of memory from VirtualBox one

426
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,820
gig of memory etc down here we have this

427
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,170
is all the code that is needed to turn a

428
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,230
machine into the an open source puppet

429
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,290
master an enterprise agent a of an agent

430
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,300
that will register itself in the foremen

431
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,250
around seven eight minutes etc so here

432
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,740
we have all of our goals they are small

433
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,250
pieces of the code and then in our the

434
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,080
Enzo demo we have so here you'll find

435
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,630
for instance the definition for a false

436
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,870
answer we give it a host only IP address

437
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,309
so that it works and then he met

438
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,100
at your end we determine which box and

439
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,230
that needs to be deployed on this or

440
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,840
it's working on it sent to a 70 to 130

441
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,830
moment we give it a host name and then

442
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,029
these roles that are roles from the

443
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,769
roles of elaboration I showed you four

444
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:44,080
so this looks quite nice because instead

445
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,080
of having a bunch of repeated code in

446
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,860
each machine

447
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,879
it only has a number of roles assigned

448
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:54,850
to it so you have here for instance our

449
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,679
elasticsearch machine needs to be

450
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,179
registered with perform and after it

451
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,570
instead of repeating that piece of code

452
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:14,639
or putting something anyway this

453
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:22,480
environment before we have our vagrant

454
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,389
sense so we have our whole stack up and

455
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,909
running on that on the step up here the

456
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,580
downside is that even a sedation to that

457
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,039
left foot I cannot actually show the web

458
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,559
interfaces at the moment because they

459
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:41,860
are running here but that's it I can

460
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,169
show you something else which is let's

461
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:55,419
say we want to add a new so imagine that

462
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:56,980
if you're on a in a production

463
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,360
environment this week you wouldn't miss

464
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,950
with the payment but you'd bring up what

465
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,840
I'm doing right now is doing this is my

466
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:16,080
no VMware so let's call this multiplying

467
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,050
Oh

468
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,029
now I can bring it up place a fossil and

469
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,629
call them

470
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:35,470
here on our show you right now you'll

471
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,680
see hopefully see what am I think I

472
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,700
think our client install and register

473
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,690
but I think it starts finally in that

474
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,950
case I think log soon long time so all

475
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,420
of these things are things that I don't

476
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,790
want to be thinking about favorite is

477
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,170
very colorful with his output

478
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,850
the one on things that you see here on

479
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,840
the right hand side just called me the

480
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,179
machine minutes updating hosts this is

481
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,279
actually a big-money plugin

482
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,860
so the vagrant loss car comes with a

483
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,600
plug-in where it is a little player is

484
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,450
able to insert etc' doses records on all

485
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,130
the machines that are already running

486
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,409
it's like the same they were in the

487
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,529
environment so if I go on my puppet

488
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:15,929
master now here 50 holes will be faulted

489
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,770
but I'll see the VM here obviously you

490
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,080
can see oh this is a poor man's TMS so

491
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,429
we wouldn't actually do this in a

492
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,540
production environment but this would be

493
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,239
managed in your actual TMS environment

494
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,129
so we didn't want to make these people

495
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:31,770
as part of hopefully they're good 3d not

496
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,780
best practices outside uh-oh

497
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,290
get there might be interested see let's

498
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,500
see

499
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:09,420
crying well 7 so we'll destroy the other

500
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,140
machine so we don't get an IP conflict

501
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,390
anyways I didn't know I share some

502
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,670
matter with the way puppet works but in

503
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,290
order to have things happen on one

504
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,030
machine that you

505
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,910
they don't another machine it requires

506
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,830
what it's called exported resources and

507
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,690
that means that a puppet ron has to

508
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,040
happen on the first machine that is

509
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,900
exporting it's a definition and then

510
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,550
that's another puppet run has to happen

511
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,250
on the other machine in this case we

512
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,840
have a we have our new client that runs

513
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,970
puppet and after that has run puppet it

514
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,340
exported the fact that it exists - i

515
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,320
think i'm or - the puppet master

516
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,540
actually and then when we run a puppet

517
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,920
home but i think i know it will be

518
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,650
automatic even old appearance

519
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,789
[Music]

520
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,559
now we deal with interesting

521
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:10,430
so as you see up here the very start of

522
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,390
the fun run you'll see an error message

523
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,849
saying hey I don't know what this

524
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,290
machine because when this machine first

525
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,960
connects it above my suit says hey I've

526
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,400
never seen that machine before but

527
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,320
because of the way the foreman is set up

528
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,630
one of my favorite juicers itself it

529
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,700
just doesn't get any configuration yet

530
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:31,460
so as you see here it's immediately it's

531
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,380
immediately done configuring all that it

532
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,510
did is a sink a bunch of plugins if I

533
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,420
run puppet agent it didn't actually

534
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,589
including any plugins normally I would

535
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:40,940
show you here in the weather to

536
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:50,270
basically Foreman how the machine shows

537
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,440
up here but for now deal with this

538
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,150
episode or try it yourself

539
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,320
so now it's run once and made itself the

540
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:32,520
one the moment however it doesn't get

541
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,810
any configuration yet because I don't

542
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,550
want that I don't want random machines

543
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,590
getting random configuration so what I

544
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,060
need to do is go into my Foreman

545
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,200
instance and the sign class to it I'll

546
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,419
just assign a base a basic class of it

547
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,220
there so I've assigned a standard class

548
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,900
student that comes with obscene or is it

549
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,350
it's a basic role that deploys I think

550
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:28,460
an agent take a little bit of time I'm

551
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,640
after that is done we can also run the

552
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,450
public pages on the I think I go and

553
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,379
watch it up here from there

554
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,969
yeah so the the thing is that so that

555
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,499
the question is if you search for office

556
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,569
later on Google you will find a github

557
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:11,579
repository that has nothing in it the

558
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,650
problem is that we for a while we were

559
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,150
hosting on github but then we felt

560
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,059
ourselves okay we are you we're bringing

561
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:23,039
out the message of up theater so we make

562
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,660
your own dog food and hold on our own

563
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,339
stuff and then for a while we were

564
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,769
hosted on github and mirrored on github

565
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:31,289
but that is a total nightmare right

566
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,029
that's that's a no-go

567
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:48,949
so what

568
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,290
he says it's there well maybe maybe the

569
00:40:53,290 --> 00:41:08,080
Google link goes to a yes

570
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,180
thank you

571
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,290
summation the thing is that we've just

572
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,600
remains to zero this week so some of

573
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,070
that stuff still points to an older

574
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,540
version probably that the link to LA

575
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,140
points up anyway our puppet run here is

576
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,650
finished

577
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,150
now and you'll see that as we scroll up

578
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,690
a little bit you're scolding sense to

579
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:37,740
get away than I am so you'll see that

580
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,120
points you'll see up here that it

581
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,870
created other I suppose the final leap

582
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,540
dog and you see here it's all being

583
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,430
created so Wow if we go on on its sing a

584
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,649
note and we run a puppet eight years

585
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,910
so right now you might be thinking or

586
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,260
something you might be thinking hey but

587
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,880
I have all of this stuff already so

588
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,460
what's the point the point is that all

589
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,960
this stuff that you see here is not

590
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,910
specific to any environmentally

591
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,970
therefore anybody can use this and if we

592
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,470
if you start thinking in that

593
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,570
abstraction layer where anything is not

594
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,280
specific to your environment you put

595
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,250
into computer in this case you will

596
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,370
arrive at a much cleaner configuration

597
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,960
for the stuff that is specific very

598
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,740
special so the last couple of

599
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,240
environments or you deployed this in

600
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,710
public code that is specific to the

601
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,810
environment of that specific environment

602
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:52,700
that is actually very little compared to

603
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,400
all the other here you see the

604
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,929
[Music]

605
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,380
so you'll see here has been created

606
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,470
automatically and the same goes for I

607
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,529
think it showed up in Cabana it's log it

608
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,450
starts putting its logs there so if you

609
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:49,779
look at the holes itself you can see

610
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:51,609
that depending on what is on the holes

611
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:54,029
itself

612
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,880
so it starts for instance putting it's a

613
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,640
I sing alongs to a we're gonna be

614
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,740
beautiful

615
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,500
so you'll see prospectors for the I sing

616
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,579
along etc etc so it starts what magazine

617
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,720
something a whole bunch of long couldn't

618
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,339
care about to file beach so that you can

619
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:41,799
they're sort of doing things it has

620
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:44,230
automatically created in the rope on

621
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,650
that for a data source or elasticsearch

622
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,500
and for its luck she be I think I send

623
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,230
this data to hitbox TVs that I things

624
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,500
are fine you can make log a draft coming

625
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,140
from the data coming from icing and data

626
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,329
coming from elasticsearch as we go along

627
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:14,440
it would be more harm I think that's it

628
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,559
for now I see the five minutes left so

629
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,119
let's go and anybody has a question

630
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,119
anybody

631
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,920
the question is how Halloween what are

632
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,630
we putting behind Buffett we are at the

633
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,130
moment America anything above as you

634
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,010
media WB there's also a plugins for the

635
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,570
four men so you can check from the

636
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,490
forward motors and WB it works quite

637
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,790
nicely together

638
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,560
so there is also some posters in there

639
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,710
some of the plans involve also in

640
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,890
pulling those parts separately to

641
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,040
separate the end if you want so you

642
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,660
become easier to manage but for now

643
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:15,900
that's a good question

644
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,090
so you saw today a parabola instance the

645
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,530
fall time that image that I just brought

646
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,450
up to the relevant image at the moment

647
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:30,360
we import 1 2 or L 706 convenient but

648
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,940
it's fairly easy to bring because of the

649
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,400
server's themselves they all run

650
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,650
relative or something like that the only

651
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,570
need also your experiment so they get

652
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,040
lab I think

653
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,700
the master my simplicity however the

654
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,899
server that you manage with that

655
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,920
[Music]

656
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:09,308
to be honest not the inkling I am or why

657
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:14,489
one of the ones we have and that woman

658
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:21,019
will probably have wool for a client

659
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,770
we'll never be at

660
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,480
sorry guys if you're leaving the room

661
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,740
that's totally fine but can you do it

662
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,060
quietly because people still have

663
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,910
questions that's the matter that that my

664
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,880
manager is feeding not me

665
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,420
[Music]

666
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,070
sorry thank you

667
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,930
the question is this isn't he a staging

668
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,760
environment for this so what I showed

669
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,990
you now is actually the the developer

670
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,640
site that's the environment processing

671
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,100
off State or functionality itself the

672
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,260
point is that all of this brings up the

673
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,350
control of mustering and then there it's

674
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,940
up to you to bring out a test

675
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,380
environment and connect test machines to

676
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,030
either the massive it comes included or

677
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,370
even bring up a second puppet master

678
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,050
which is also a totally watch you can

679
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,970
have a second machine that also has the

680
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,450
same hopefully their public role or

681
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,910
vault master so let's get the same

682
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,850
I was really hoping that people would

683
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,920
get feedback here because so far we

684
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,710
haven't isn't really speaking in public

685
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,650
about it because until now it wasn't

686
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,900
really something I would recommend other

687
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,210
people to use and now we're getting to a

688
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:05,130
point where three four I would love to

689
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,700
get you tired
