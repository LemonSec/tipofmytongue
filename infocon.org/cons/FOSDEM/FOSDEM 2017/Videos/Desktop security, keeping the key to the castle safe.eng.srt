1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,990
so hello everyone welcome again to

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,059
secure it to the room this is Michael

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,920
starer from reddit who will talk about

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,549
desktop security and joy thank you thank

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,070
you so first thanks for coming so soon

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,950
in the morning it's also up for me and

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,390
I'm sorry to say that I have a lot of

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,270
slide I speak fast I never need 20

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,079
minutes so I excuse in advance I would

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,180
also like to for people to not take

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,880
picture or at least not too much if you

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,629
can so I stayed I'm working at reddit

13
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,239
I'm a system administrator in the open

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,589
source instead of team which is a team

15
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:46,289
dedicated to a upstream community

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,989
project it's mostly community management

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,499
but sometimes we also try to fix value

18
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,480
things for example infrastructure which

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
is exactly my job that's why I'm system

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,239
administrator and I'm here to speak with

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,489
you about the step security because in

22
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,890
the past I had to endure infrastructure

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,290
security program and it took me three

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,510
weeks of my time and I do not want to do

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,890
that so I'm trying to fix the wood code

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,020
which is basically fixing developer

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,960
workflow and fixing server today

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,400
focusing on developer workflow so making

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,990
sure that stuff are secure so I do not

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,600
have to clean after I do up still my

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
minecraft server to make phone and

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,750
everything to build so yeah just to quit

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,220
server who is using Linux on the desktop

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,730
good perfect so let's go back to the

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,420
basics regarding security so far

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,160
security concept there is lot of paper

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,280
out there but one of the way to define

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,650
security is to speak about CIA not the

39
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,930
bad guy in the James Bond movies but

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,510
about availability making sure that your

41
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,600
system are working properly making sure

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
that people that can read something as

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,750
the only people who tries to read

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,260
something and making sure that people

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,610
who are not supposed to modify something

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,460
are not modifying some things that's the

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,590
basic principle for security from a

48
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,419
theoretical point of view and we will go

49
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,379
back later on why we need that and if

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,719
you want to achieve this property we

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,130
need to think

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,820
who wants to break that and most of the

53
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,110
time there is mostly two type of

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,030
attacker which are described in some

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,130
papers that I forgot to type in my notes

56
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,360
about Mossad or not Mossad so that's

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,350
basically either automated low-skill run

58
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,410
like some kind of form or brute-force

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,910
SSH and this kind of stuff will happen

60
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,480
quite a lot anybody willing sshd log

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
because there is nothing on TV would

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,230
cease a lot of people are trying to

63
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,830
attack that and there is a apt which is

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,570
not a Debian package er I'm walking out

65
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,800
where that I'm not trying to attack the

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,590
gun it's a advanced persistent threat

67
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,360
it's people that really wants to get you

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,310
and web time and most of the time money

69
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,260
because our time is money and you do not

70
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,210
pay a car to just watch that when there

71
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,780
is lot of stuff to do usually that's

72
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,060
what people we share and I say also NSA

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,680
is trying to get on your infrastructure

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,630
on TCO knocks off but sometime it can be

75
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,000
or anyone else it can be is at least

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,180
that means that you did that you did

77
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,430
immediate earthquake or last time that

78
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,260
enables that do not like you and want to

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,180
get you and this kind of stuff you are

80
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,670
not always fighting against someone with

81
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,260
lot of money but most of the time

82
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,860
someone with lot and lot of time so I

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,740
will just play off some some assumption

84
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,770
on what we want to secure I would assume

85
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,540
that people are running laptop because

86
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,310
workstation is just a subset of the

87
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,610
problem of laptop our laptop is just a

88
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,709
workstation mobile a mobile workstation

89
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,050
and you just add the problem of someone

90
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,670
will steal it someone will be able to

91
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,540
reset it so first for security it should

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,410
be quite abused

93
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm giving the talk to a lot of people

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,580
but we are first them so stop by using

95
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,010
free software and it's not to antagonize

96
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,350
people not running free software but if

97
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,970
you cannot inspect anything if you

98
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,280
cannot choose what you want it's quite

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,670
out make sure it's secure use supported

100
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,610
software it seems to be also abuse but

101
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,930
discussing with people this is not the

102
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,390
case for example I know that federal 9

103
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,190
was a better distribution because it was

104
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,750
before system G and pizza dough but

105
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,229
seriously stop using it with and

106
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,330
eastward get bit of stuff are by better

107
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,039
I mean a lot of security in provement

108
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,839
I'm pretty sure that people will be able

109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,089
to talk about that later in the day so

110
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm not gonna speak about this do not

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,449
choose one Dom we posit or it's pretty

112
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,550
nice that you can get a random blend of

113
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,369
stuff from a PPA but most of the time

114
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,930
people have no idea on what they are

115
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,460
doing and you cannot see what they are

116
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,770
doing or not and that's how you get

117
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,469
package that are not updated or packaged

118
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:56,740
with a co-op software or anything if you

119
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,119
choose a distribution you need to check

120
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:01,059
the bit system some are highly secure

121
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,099
where you build everything in a way

122
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,860
strategy from internet with auditing and

123
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,990
everything and some of them are just

124
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,999
let's build that on a Windows laptop and

125
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:14,379
update it without checking so yeah but

126
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,879
you can take a mainstream distribution

127
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,589
verify which rocks and you should be

128
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,889
fine make sure that it's reported then

129
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,899
for installation while you need to use

130
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,009
an encrypted disk

131
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,749
alright seems to be obvious but lots of

132
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,999
people do not do that I will recommend

133
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,619
to user leaks and for disk encryption

134
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:34,029
last time I did the presentation people

135
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,039
did ask me about veracrypt and proof it

136
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,919
I do not know if they are good or not

137
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,020
I remember the reason I did that was

138
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,550
done for TrueCrypt and it seems to be

139
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,249
secure my main problem is that it's not

140
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,199
integrated in the situation so maybe

141
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,330
it's not maintained enough maybe it's

142
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,149
not as simulation is as it would so go

143
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,449
back to the part about supported system

144
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,589
and so a question is why do you need

145
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,740
that well it's mostly because my laptop

146
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,749
are mobile and it's quite easy to steal

147
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:04,089
one it happened to a friend of mine two

148
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,669
days ago it happened to people in the

149
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:07,209
office

150
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,939
it happened lots of time and if the disk

151
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,499
is no top 15 most of the times the

152
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,269
laptop is just sold on the black market

153
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,999
and sometimes there is document like

154
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,969
secret mi6 document it did happen in the

155
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,629
past save our time so now you just need

156
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,189
to do that to protect from someone

157
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:27,999
stealing your laptop so of course it's

158
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,039
not perfect as always what we call

159
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,259
called boot attack where people just

160
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,509
take your laptop when it's about what

161
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,269
when it's responded and take out the

162
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:40,149
chips from memory and then dump it and

163
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,949
turn out that the key is somewhere in

164
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,030
memory

165
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,840
it's quite out to do without stole the

166
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,510
ring just lapped up as a memory I start

167
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,670
out so you cannot do that easily but you

168
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,790
can do that from other laptop there is a

169
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,010
tag called even made where someone

170
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,240
replace your bootloader with a

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,130
bootloader that we call the password so

172
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,500
you type the password this is fully

173
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,360
automated with a github project called

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,900
evil Abigail to protect from that you

175
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,670
can use the Cure boot which will make

176
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,910
some free software Forrest trial but I'm

177
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,790
it's working it's not integrated in this

178
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,410
region as far as I know which is a shame

179
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,630
so if you want to make me happy

180
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,800
please integrate that in your

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,520
distribution you can start to use GPM

182
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
which is another way to make a free

183
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,770
software prescribe secure boot is using

184
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,810
TPM this is used to verify the integrity

185
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,750
of the boot and everything like this I'm

186
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,820
not gonna pick more because I have only

187
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,990
20 minutes and that with value Santi had

188
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,840
made the trick Margaret did propose a

189
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,729
TPM OTP something I think one year ago

190
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,440
we're basically each time you boot you

191
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,080
get a verification number to verify with

192
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,110
your phone to see that no one tampered

193
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,940
with your laptop

194
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,140
usually it's quite easy to carry your

195
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,030
laptop everywhere you go but it's not

196
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,150
practical I do that it start to be quite

197
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,850
evil if you want to get something usable

198
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,440
you need to have a lot of battery and

199
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,080
everything

200
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
TPM OTP is not really easy to use but

201
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,919
that's the kind of stuff that we should

202
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,970
integrate well then there is an attack

203
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,510
for example

204
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,820
people news that a FireWire can be used

205
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,190
with their memory I guess the answer is

206
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,419
no on some old MacBook and like even

207
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,160
lenovo laptops you can use a tool called

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
inception you just plug two laptop

209
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,940
together won't pretend to be your

210
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,969
firewire system and just dump the memory

211
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,169
with the key that we were looking

212
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,610
despite having lots of MacBook and

213
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,650
unprotected laptop from salespeople in

214
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,300
the office I was never able to test

215
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,830
mostly because I was never able to

216
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,770
window defy what cable I need on Amazon

217
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,110
which is quite bad but I'm pretty sure

218
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,040
it should be working so to protect

219
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,839
against order of that with various

220
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,750
alternative approach good road on a USB

221
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,570
stick it's much easier to carry so USB

222
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,570
stick with you it's really simple you

223
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,850
can get in in your pocket I mean I have

224
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,680
a deep pocket but not to put my laptop

225
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,500
there but I will system with a web

226
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,870
support of Luke's so everything is

227
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,209
encrypted except Luke's there is some

228
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,420
stuff on 50 the stick I seem to exist on

229
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
Amazon I would not recommend that

230
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,360
because this is proprietary hardware I

231
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,510
don't know how it works there is some

232
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,589
people would suggest using the

233
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,870
fingerprint reader it's quite easy to

234
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,850
copy if you are fighting against NSA

235
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,730
Mossad whatever I would avoid that if

236
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,050
you want some things that work I would

237
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,450
also avoid that mine is quite puppy I

238
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,700
need to do it five time and I'm pretty

239
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,430
sure that no anybody can fake my

240
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,300
fingerprint and so yeah so that just

241
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,310
fall so good something to take a look at

242
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,829
is very serious be attack so if you find

243
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,770
a random key on the parking lot do not

244
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,850
plug it on your laptop if someone wants

245
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,040
to test something there is a Python tap

246
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,250
and was very pleased ago which is a nice

247
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,770
attack where you plug something on your

248
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,959
laptop and it appear as a network device

249
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,000
and start to stiffen the world traffic

250
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,700
and attack your browser it's quite

251
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,250
efficient I have not been able to test

252
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,399
on my favorite salesperson because I was

253
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,470
not able to finish a setup before living

254
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,810
for wisdom but I would whip up next year

255
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,060
which works and if they decide to fire

256
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,870
me for testing on sales there is all

257
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,700
kind of file system bugs I am pretty

258
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,770
sure that people would compare their own

259
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,020
kernel did see that there is like 24

260
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,000
systems that you never heard of like the

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,940
file system for Amiga and everything you

262
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,200
can be pretty sure that the Risberg

263
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,209
because no one is using them so no one

264
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,060
is looking for security bugs and you do

265
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,380
not want to have a security bug on a

266
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,600
file system running in the kernel it's

267
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,350
just bad there is USB stack bugs

268
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,690
basically again the result of trap we

269
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,140
are doing anything

270
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,149
for that you can use something called

271
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,670
the u.s. big world this is done by a

272
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,709
developer at reddit just look for a u.s.

273
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,260
big world it prevent Ottoman thing from

274
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,589
a random device and I will spoke about

275
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,690
speak we stopped to speak about that

276
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,550
because our well security as the world

277
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,730
is completely depressing if people went

278
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,940
to Calais computer Congress not last

279
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,010
year before there is a talk by your

280
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,990
honor would cover who explained Oh

281
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,510
everything is completely broken if you

282
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,370
know if you have to happen life just for

283
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,560
that and then you will start to become a

284
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,320
depress and season as depressed as a

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
season mean so yeah if you really want I

286
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
would recommend qsr I'm not running it

287
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,930
because well I'm trying to be cooperate

288
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,050
so I'm running were seven but maybe next

289
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,610
time for my next laptop I would try to

290
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,070
do that someone has to fill the memory

291
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,250
of my laptop so yeah let's back to us

292
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,920
and back to the basics of course you

293
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,829
need to use a strong password I will not

294
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,959
discuss on what is a strong because

295
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
people always disagree on that I just

296
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,790
want to remind you to take human factor

297
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,279
in account if you have a twenty or later

298
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,649
password yes that's nice but maybe it's

299
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,399
out remember and sometimes if you are in

300
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
a way for example you are at a pub and

301
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,350
suddenly everything is broken and you

302
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,329
need to fix it and eternal that you

303
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,649
drink too much you can type your

304
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,050
password that's bad it's not at all what

305
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,350
happened to me just to make sure use a

306
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,440
password manager one solution is to not

307
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,540
keep data on the laptop which is

308
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,829
sometimes doable

309
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,589
that's what Chrome OS is doing sometime

310
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,000
it's not doable when you have no

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,399
internet connectivity like when you are

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,300
traveling to Belgium you can use the

313
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,699
browser this is usually cumbersome and

314
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,640
annoying and you are likely to miss

315
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,279
something and not use the right user you

316
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,170
can start to use separate computer I do

317
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,910
not have to explain oh it's expensive

318
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,269
but if you have one computer to surf on

319
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,550
Facebook and one computer to play with

320
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,000
your server it can be done then again

321
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,290
it's quite heavy to prevent remote

322
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,649
exploit while obviously a firewall that

323
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,759
seems to be magic but again I find lot

324
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,019
and a lot of people would say Oh Freya

325
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,620
or I do not want to have one the whis

326
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,660
problem is fire because it breaks stuff

327
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,620
but I think we should fix that in depth

328
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,170
so disable what you do not need even if

329
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,540
you want to just a set up a PHP my

330
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,379
sequel stuff well disable and make sure

331
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,410
that nobody can access it make sure that

332
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,300
whatever you install are do not listen

333
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,579
on the network it can be even better to

334
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,240
use VM and background I have this tie to

335
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,459
say container can be a solution I think

336
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,540
I should have remove it can be a

337
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,759
solution if you have too much free time

338
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,620
but for now it's not mature enough and

339
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,420
you need to wait on people to do

340
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,959
integration so virus scanner are

341
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,120
dangerous I do not know if you've seen

342
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,730
the research from the guy at Google for

343
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,810
this and basically every IV antivirus

344
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,959
are bad clam up at cyber security issue

345
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,720
most of the times I do not find anything

346
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,819
so maybe it's working for Windows but

347
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,519
I'm not a Windows user so our agreement

348
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
against that all right the diode is not

349
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,740
about ipv6 and shuttin so if you have

350
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,829
ipv6 it's quite nice but you might be

351
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,220
scanned immediately by Odin it was much

352
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,259
more interesting last year when I did

353
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,180
the talk because it was new now it's old

354
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,529
stuff so people do not care and if you

355
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,689
want to know more about how people get

356
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:52,110
attacked

357
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,050
we commander so the EIU an aside told

358
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,860
from a enigma last year so geo is a

359
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,569
tailored access operations which is

360
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,059
basically people giving access to the

361
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,610
NSA also called actor in the movie and

362
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,709
the x-plane all they do stuff what they

363
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,350
do like we are waiting and we are

364
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,730
scanning everything we have lot of

365
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,620
documentation more documentation on your

366
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,809
network than you have which is nice I

367
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:16,949
mean they should publish it it would

368
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,790
save me or some work and most of the

369
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,379
time the victor of attack if you look at

370
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,449
our report and everything well that's

371
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:28,230
basic fishing we have seen with virgins

372
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,660
leek fishing can be quite efficient

373
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,980
people say yeah you need to Ontario

374
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,110
password and everything two-factor

375
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,270
authentication can prevent that but not

376
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,790
so much especially when using with

377
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,650
mobile phone but I'm not speaking at all

378
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,900
about mobile phone it's completely

379
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,160
broken obviously I do not open water

380
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
management do not do like me we try to

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,690
run a values online just to see if it

382
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,850
works it's a bad idea because sometime

383
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,600
it works what you can do is use the

384
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,690
sandbox a certain extent box for example

385
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,720
I have a co-worker with using our over

386
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,590
VM based on gen 2 and everything I did

387
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,420
that in Alfred a just because we're

388
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,100
starting to sell yeah you cannot do that

389
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,900
for that fast inside ok I'm going to do

390
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,750
it and it did that in the afternoon so

391
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,780
yes alright next one box for jail except

392
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,520
that fire chair is broken so do not do

393
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,450
that I should have updated that side

394
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,340
well not the car because the car is to

395
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,300
completely Kate it is not made for that

396
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,430
seems to be better but it's not made

397
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,970
especially for that kind of security if

398
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,210
you are really motivated you can turn on

399
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,250
a certain extent the desktop currently

400
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,040
on word 7 it contains some process like

401
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,370
flash which is a good idea and not so

402
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,070
much more I would be app if someone can

403
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,730
contribute more policy you can also if

404
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,250
you are working in the military use mgs

405
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,750
policy where you say it is top secret

406
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,910
and only process for secret difference

407
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,070
can access it and design yourself it's

408
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,750
also quite out of setup but use a

409
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,410
military can you can - we can get our

410
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,800
cornered contain the user which is what

411
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,480
the racer dynamics guy at where that are

412
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,730
doing and I speak about what they do

413
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,589
like one user that can only prove the

414
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,780
web and everything like this so there is

415
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,290
a still a lot of work to do you can also

416
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,170
wait wait wait look at flat pack there

417
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,930
is likely some a presentation about that

418
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,750
this is basically the future and it will

419
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,400
be likely contained with something like

420
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,120
a perm or sirenix and then I have a lot

421
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,070
of style but both security because

422
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,100
browser is a huge

423
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,720
system so you have to choose between

424
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,860
Chrome and Firefox I tend to prefer

425
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,380
Firefox because there is less conflict

426
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,179
in enterprise between my interest as a

427
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,720
user and the interests of the company so

428
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,280
we move flash blog Java by default which

429
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,470
we cannot remove it

430
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,510
block multimedia content because

431
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,220
multimedia is all kind of preserve

432
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,929
complicated stuff optimize for

433
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,110
performance so it's better if you do not

434
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,740
autoplay we did see some issue with that

435
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,210
in the past and there is no presentation

436
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,460
about that specific topic in a few hours

437
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,100
WebGL and direct3d access well basically

438
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,960
your browser will access directly you

439
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
are we're bypassing the kernel I hope I

440
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,429
do not talk to explain why it's bad and

441
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,400
why the driver are likely full of bugs

442
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,750
and everything same goes for WebRTC

443
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,510
that's asking for trouble from a network

444
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,840
point of view setting master password

445
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,940
for your password again in case someone

446
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,920
get access to your backups user stuff

447
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,660
like HTTP if we were to protect your

448
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,030
password no script it's a pain in the

449
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,520
ass but I think it's worthwhile staff

450
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,350
password to verify if someone is

451
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,020
changing the certificate most of the

452
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,700
time it just like Lee Starbuck trying to

453
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,720
MIT mu

454
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,510
sometimes it's the Chinese government

455
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,940
you cannot really see the difference if

456
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,980
you are ready paranoid you can use you

457
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,420
can remove all this field and write that

458
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,780
with Romero dodge yes I will let use a

459
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,160
surprise for that one because it's

460
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,940
really scary you can well I do have a

461
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,150
lot of side of privacy and mass

462
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,309
surveillance and ons a it working people

463
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,679
over the web patching exploits in

464
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,679
advertisement and it's been better with

465
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,300
precise targeting because we can say

466
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,070
yeah I want to send that targeted

467
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,140
advertisement with that people to that

468
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,720
person right there so it's so much

469
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,760
easier to just a new word that specific

470
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,480
payload to you

471
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,460
so again stuff like adblock Cookie

472
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,670
Monster my time is up so I would just

473
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,150
keep cuttin so if you have any question

474
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,740
and you ask them because I didn't notice

475
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,600
so yeah so I guess we'll thank Michael

476
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,880
for for the talk and I'm sure there's

477
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:17,770
more material and there's more material

478
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,840
but I think we also have five minutes

479
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,120
for questions so raise your hand if you

480
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,310
want to raise ask a question and we'll

481
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:31,440
pass around the mic anyone

482
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:48,039
GARP so you mentioned a firewall on

483
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,350
my laptop I have zero ports open

484
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,460
incoming so what does the fire will help

485
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,039
me there but in case someone decide to

486
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,139
open a port for you the firewall will L

487
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:05,639
I don't know any more questions yeah

488
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,889
repeat the question okay so the question

489
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,740
is I have no open fire oh no fan port on

490
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,399
my laptop

491
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:15,130
what firewall will achieve and in case

492
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,010
something do open a firewall open a port

493
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,139
the firewall will prevent it from doing

494
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:22,690
anything like someone try to exploit you

495
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,000
it can block it's a second line of

496
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,769
defense against the first line which is

497
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:30,970
being secure enough hello how do you

498
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,159
think you can convince non-technical

499
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,850
users to block multimedia content I

500
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,840
think you can't my presentation is

501
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,880
mostly targeted at the people will be

502
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,600
targeted by that for regular user what

503
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,399
we need is more contain is the wizard

504
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,409
program is a multimedia content we need

505
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,539
to make sure that for example the parser

506
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,880
is a not able to access the Internet of

507
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
this kind of stuff but that's something

508
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,720
that require coding and that cannot be

509
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,700
done now so I will be happy if people

510
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,460
start to work on that making sure for

511
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,760
example that some day some nails in

512
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,190
Konami are contained making sure that

513
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,049
Firefox start to do stuff in separate

514
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,090
process without anything like a chrome

515
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,299
is doing but in the meantime I want to

516
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,120
get something that people can do now and

517
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,559
faster that can be done later well it

518
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,450
can be done later but yes it's yeah and

519
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,460
I forgot the question was oh do we

520
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,399
convince regular non-technical user to

521
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:35,580
block material content more questions

522
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,789
hello

523
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,510
in one of the slides that you put do put

524
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,210
our third your speech I showed you beaky

525
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,149
yeah do you recommend you wiki so I

526
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,490
would recommend the Yubikey to store SSH

527
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,399
key you cannot see from here but I do

528
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,549
have one

529
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:56,269
to adjust a star my SSH key so someone

530
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,799
will attack my laptop you will be able

531
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,959
to use the Yubikey when I'm connected

532
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,399
but you cannot steal it and use it for

533
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:02,570
something else later

534
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,080
I do not specially we come on you

535
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,639
believe us which also stuff it just that

536
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,559
I go to be key because it's on Amazon

537
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,749
and I could not get my end on a neutral

538
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:14,389
key or a good a smart card but it's

539
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,059
mostly yeah I will come on it and it

540
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,059
also do universal to factor which is

541
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,369
quite interesting because if you turn to

542
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,289
factor and it's not using SMS you

543
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:27,589
suddenly have 1000 line on your

544
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,139
application on your phone and one phone

545
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,359
is bad and secondly 1000 line is not

546
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,539
properly weeks using a Yubikey on u2f

547
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,570
you can get something something workable

548
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,459
in my opinion so if people wants to

549
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,149
contact me

550
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:46,190
do not used it because i do not use that

551
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,159
you can use miss cafe.com

552
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,799
or you can find me on IFC but leave

553
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,679
office this I did that blue on black was

554
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,599
a good idea

555
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,950
so you can find me on freenode on

556
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,589
anything you can ping me after offers

557
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:05,119
them if possible now if anybody has any

558
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,579
question last one yeah I think wet I'm

559
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,009
one minute more for one last question if

560
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm honest and people can also ask me

561
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,849
later

562
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:18,619
outside a Miskin IRC that it works so

563
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:19,639
for example on freenode

564
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:24,320
on when HTC and other stuff so can just

565
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,259
look for misc on your favorite IRC

566
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:32,239
network by mail ok let's thank Michael

567
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,269
for
