1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,740
we didn't catch the crashes that we used

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,480
to catch before so if we grow the

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,220
community on the nightly Channel we

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,469
don't we don't catch them on the honor

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,469
so it's faster then you talked about

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,039
automation a lot of the crashes that we

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,180
have they are specific to the

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,490
configuration of the people graphic

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,890
cards antivirals add-ins terms of things

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,019
like the metric is gigantic

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,830
so everything that we know we test

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,140
automatically but what we don't know we

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,110
cannot have tests for and that's what we

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,140
are looking for and a knack we have just

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,090
landed the electrolysis electrolysis

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,530

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,020
concern coming that's a lot of grown

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,850
work like important changes like

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,010
hundreds of thousands of lines of code

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,890
that's all going to land and we will

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,120
need this feedback very very very early
