1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,820
okay so it's sad first where he is going

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,830
to talk about the retail computing I

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,170
have to say I'm surprised there's so

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,840
many people interested in this

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,310
yeah so I originally picked this stock

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,490
because I'm very selfish and I'm

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,089
interested in this myself so I thought I

8
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,210
will have someone talked about this

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,510
transfer here boom - I hope you enjoyed

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,150
the talk thank you

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,910
so welcome yeah well I've never seen so

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,030
many people I found my talks usually I

13
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,239
talk about haiku does the crowd is much

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,620
smaller but so yeah I'm also into

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,490
antique I've already given a talk about

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,520
freeing your antiques at the liberal

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,730
surfer meeting two years ago so I

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,270
thought I would give it a different

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,950
twist this year so let's talk first

20
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,950
about the really old boxes from the 80s

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,830
you know I had auric Atmos most of you

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,260
probably know about the c64 from

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,700
Commodore and other stuff like Apple 2

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,979
and many others so basically those were

25
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:52,810
small boxes with an 8-bit CPU others

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,800
6502 or z80 on there are there were many

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,660
at the time before Intel took the home

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,190
market most of them had much less than

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,949
64 kilobytes of RAM

30
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,900
that's not much and usually you just had

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,720
text display if you are lucky you could

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,080
get some graphics but like 200 by 200 or

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,209
something like this some had a sound

34
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,830
chip that could play some tunes and most

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,280
of those had a cassette tape for storage

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,209
so you had to play Type C load blah blah

37
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,730
blah and then go get one two three

38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,880
coffees and maybe it didn't crash by

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,570
loading your game but some of them had

40
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,680
expensive floppy drives yeah and some

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,140
had serial ports but not all of them and

42
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,989
most of them run run the Microsoft basic

43
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,209
language in the room but some guy wrote

44
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,880
a nice operating system for the c64

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,580
that's called Kentucky

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,630
and he later well later people ported it

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,660
to other architectures and then he

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,250
himself reused it for his PhD thesis as

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,320
an operating system for the Internet of

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,680
Things so you si can get to interesting

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,950
things so it's based on proto spreads

52
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,010
which actually share a single stack for

53
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,110
others in the thread it's quite

54
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,990
interesting and they even have an ipv4

55
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,990
and ipv6 stack that's certified for by

56
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,130
Cisco so it's well nice and a quote

57
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,940
graphical interface that can even run as

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,750
a VNC server and it has web browser IRC

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,750
and anything like it looks like this if

60
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,260
it does work I might actually have I

61
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,000
might actually be able to run it live

62
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,030
let's see 64 emulator out which the

63
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,150
window is here I've activated the turbo

64
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,720
mode here because it's a bit slow but

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,580
yeah Kerry works

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,470
say it's learning quite a lot of stuff

67
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:49,780
there we go oh did I oh yeah right

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:58,330
that's weird and it looks like this seek

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,540
and actually open menus and run the

70
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,690
network configuration and yeah well I

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,490
don't have a network set up but there's

72
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,090
a web browser IRC client and a lot of

73
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:23,560
interesting useless stuff so that's for

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,030
Kentucky

75
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,530
I put example the sample code for the

76
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,300
the about box here one page and second

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,570
page so you see process thread blah blah

78
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,570
and then it's even base so it switches

79
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,210
those threads and when we're waiting for

80
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,050
events there are many operating systems

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,610
for those old machines some of them are

82
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,020
free and open source software others are

83
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,770
more of well I don't really care or the

84
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,960
source code is here but I don't care

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,600
whatever now let's talk about newer CPUs

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,450
like sixteenth a little bit that of

87
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,900
course the 68k with the whole family a

88
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,700
Sharif Omega

89
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,669
Magnus and all those ARM arm was born by

90
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,600
a corn they created the CPU for the old

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,450
machine the first the ultimate and then

92
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:37,390
the risk PC and many others and the 8080

93
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,219
86 for the PC

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,620
and yeah so those platforms we're a bit

95
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,060
better Louis had a mouse and graphics up

96
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,950
to VGA or something sometimes 266 for

97
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,760
hours sometimes better rows are most

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,960
hard and usually floppy drives and lucky

99
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,560
people had a hard drive and if it was

100
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,780
getting better for networking Ethernet

101
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,830
wasn't really the standard at the time

102
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,660
of course they're on the freebsd netbsd

103
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,690
sorry because Nettie I didn't have been

104
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,540
ported to those architectures even

105
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,229
toasters I've heard so yeah you need an

106
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,660
MMU of course and enough ram but you

107
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,580
might be able to get an extra much one

108
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,740
gnu/linux used to support those machines

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,340
long ago yeah yeah still then great

110
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,290
debian stops officially supporting them

111
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,840
but you can get some archives there's

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,820
risk wares which isn't really free

113
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,410
software the source code has been

114
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,710
published but it's a non-commercial

115
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,800
license so well kind of but there are

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,510
application database is nice because it

117
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,240
says if this is a shareware freeware and

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,700
GPL v2 whatever so we can actually

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,479
search for apps that are free software

120
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:14,740
the sorry hardware which well was quite

121
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:21,910
nice the fact one had full Oh 300 30 CPU

122
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,280
so you had an mm you could run yeah

123
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,060
right exactly

124
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,690
I didn't mention that and some clones

125
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,059
and there's a new hardware at the fire B

126
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,630
which is a caught fire CPU so yes it's

127
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,260
very nice is a small small box and an

128
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,470
FPGA emulation and there's are a name

129
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,680
which you can run on your machine your

130
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,490
PC which emulates kind of a clone or 40

131
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,080
clone

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,209
so there are free software operating

133
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,390
systems for the Atari does mu toes and

134
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,690
those means which isn't the Linux Mint

135
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,399
distro it's mint is not toes which is

136
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,640
free software now as friendly primitive

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,750
multitasking it has UNIX ish API and

138
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,740
even a you drive because it it was like

139
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,250
the DOS there was ABC drivin and as a

140
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,589
you for UNIX drive which has slash

141
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,010
products / blah blah blah so it's it's a

142
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,740
bit weird but it's funny and maybe hi

143
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,720
quiz I'm there started the hike report

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,120
but there well and there I've put up a

145
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,600
lot of links all the blue blue words are

146
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,149
hyperlinks in the PDF and so you can

147
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,680
click them yeah most authors for this

148
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,600
platform don't really care about free

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,880
software so sometimes they publish the

150
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,830
source code but they either don't care

151
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,770
what people do or they say I'll just

152
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,959
don't do commercial stuff so it's not

153
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,779
very free software so maybe if you beg

154
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,270
them they might think oh yeah I could

155
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,060
put a license on it and them so just

156
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,089
trying and made them who knows some more

157
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:17,570
links yeah I make it hardware so maybe

158
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,320
some of you weren't born at the time but

159
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,660
there was a huge wall between Atari and

160
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:31,710
Amiga so well but their friend now so

161
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,410
yeah yeah I know both sides so the Amiga

162
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,080
usually had a cheaper version of the the

163
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,960
CPU so you had to add an accelerator

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,170
card to get an MMU and well new Linux or

165
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,130
BSD ESO but there are still new hardware

166
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,380
as well and the India media world the

167
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,390
new vampire - accelerator but lacks an

168
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,500
MMU and after you write

169
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,360
there's a mini make which is also an

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:08,910
FPGA emulation exactly and there are a

171
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,080
lot of forks of the emulator UAE so I

172
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,220
didn't really put a link because I

173
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,880
didn't know which one to put and there

174
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,040
are PPC machines but well that's sitting

175
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,120
so eros

176
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,220
it's it used to be America Amiga

177
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,320
replacements operating system now it's a

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,860
media research operating system so it's

179
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,540
compatible with the original one but

180
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,230
it's free software and it includes the

181
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:45,990
full desktop well the goal of Varro's

182
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,480
was to be binary compatible and yeah

183
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,850
they kind of slipped away from that and

184
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,560
yes I said it

185
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,070
there's an arm port as well so I don't

186
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,110
really have an UAE set up working right

187
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:15,959
now in past many others also included

188
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,560
twice yeah I just had a look at a minute

189
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,650
and the the directory listing isn't

190
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,329
mentioned the listens with our rid Me's

191
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:32,370
which actually yes mentioned the list so

192
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,399
I don't have UAE working it's just

193
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,800
trashing today I don't know why but

194
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,380
that's our name so it's the the Atari

195
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,360
emulator with the the basic desktop

196
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,920
from mint so well it's not really

197
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,470
customized it can look a lot nicer than

198
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,110
that but yeah and this morning I saw a

199
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,720
tweet from someone saying oh the the

200
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,370
assembler source code has been published

201
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,430
for this so I'd figure I'd put it here

202
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,220
some more references I probably forgot

203
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,810
some links but yeah so wait what about

204
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,610
the PC well now there are still free dos

205
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,620
people are still working on a DOS

206
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,510
operating system for the PC yes that's

207
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,019
weird

208
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,899
and je m GM has been open source some

209
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,990
time ago so you can actually run a jam

210
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,709
desktop 386bsd which the last published

211
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,070
version was zero zero point one or

212
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,060
something until very recently and then

213
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,440
the latest one has been published as

214
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,120
with the source code so yeah it's like

215
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,079
I've seen it in capital du Libre some

216
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,870
months ago and then there's camera 2

217
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,510
which is actually a shell for Windows 3

218
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,579
so yeah it's it's real I think that is

219
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,970
even kalimera Vista or something people

220
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,480
like crazy and then there's wait there's

221
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,540
multi disguise it's an Universal

222
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,890
operating system that runs everywhere

223
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,550
and ok that's just at fall but I had to

224
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,939
mention it

225
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,510
there are many funny libraries around

226
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,209
that could be used to port software to

227
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:37,320
use those platforms like for games there

228
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,670
are Allegro STL well the 1.2 STL which

229
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,640
is the two that actually has been

230
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,350
rewritten from scratch that they ditched

231
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,560
all the antique stuff so it's just when

232
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,110
Android and Mac OS so well

233
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,260
and yeah and UNIX with x11

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,170
so people know about and curses and on

235
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,050
Linux but there's also PD curses which

236
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,240
has been ported to many other platforms

237
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,150
including SDL so if you have SDL you can

238
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,070
actually run curse these applications as

239
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,310
well there are other stuff like portly

240
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,200
but I couldn't find a license so I

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,690
probably made them to see if they can

242
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,450
put a proper license on it an 85

243
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,420
dialogue is useful useful with SDL apps

244
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
so you can actually have the single

245
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,870
window as real apps but at least we have

246
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,300
native file requesters so it's a bit

247
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,620
more native yeah some interesting apps

248
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,680
like Q Emacs written my favorites Bella

249
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,160
so you probably know that qmu ffmpeg and

250
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,610
other weird stuff like this well it's

251
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,920
this guy is a crazy crazy guy

252
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,230
yeah rhapsody IRC is bit simpler than

253
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,750
here see to port and yeah OCP each you

254
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,200
have some music and then there's the

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
browser we need internet access and we

256
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,750
need a web browser

257
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,960
there's netzer which started as a

258
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,980
browser for the risk PC and nervous

259
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,520
chorus it works with sixteen megabytes

260
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,150
of RAM and since then it has been ported

261
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,810
to new Linux so you can use GDK on the

262
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,250
frame buffer for embedded devices i

263
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,370
ported it to haiku has been ported to

264
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,290
atari mint and Amiga OS so also ours and

265
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,820
other mostly proprietary platforms and

266
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,410
react wise because it's been ported to

267
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,090
Windows so and so yeah it supports html5

268
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:00,570
and CSS well most of CSS and some day

269
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,270
JavaScript should work

270
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,349
sorry and then there's nice guys from

271
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,540
net surf they also maintained a tool

272
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,410
chain across GCC with all the lives that

273
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,319
are required for net serve so basically

274
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,240
you just insert install their tool chain

275
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,980
and you can actually start porting

276
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,819
applications to those platforms so it's

277
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,629
really really useful

278
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,420
well III was fast so thanks for watching

279
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,790
so you might get more infos in my

280
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,100
previous talk at arm ll yeah thanks and

281
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:55,620
time for questions question

282
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,799
yep

283
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,660
so the question was have you tried

284
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,260
porting any of these to handheld devices

285
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,300
like palm actually I do have an HP I

286
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,170
pack not iPad I pack the small windows

287
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:34,700
ze device but I I've passed by some

288
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,650
toolchain stuff but it wasn't really

289
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,670
maintained I think there are ports like

290
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,000
VLC has had been ported to those but

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,760
it's not really maintained either

292
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,870
there's stuff like pu t t y so the ssh

293
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,890
client van naturally maintained either

294
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,080
for windows ee

295
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,100
i didn't really look into palm stuff so

296
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:14,300
but yeah some version of linux usually

297
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:21,000
just was arm devices was developed when

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,640
they were kind of old ones I don't know

299
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,160
how it is with mainline so you are

300
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,260
probably stuck with semi like to six

301
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:38,190
kernels for Windows CE devices for many

302
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,300
of them there were also Linux ports miss

303
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:50,250
levels of usefulness yes times which

304
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,380
means everything right not running for

305
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,470
more survived just so to sign up for the

306
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,350
Pandav I see the arm devices from time

307
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:08,340
you can run Linux and the 4080 68k once

308
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,350
well just stick to Palm OS and for

309
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,170
Windows CE II does yeah I recall seeing

310
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,750
Linux ports mm well you

311
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,740
Emelia for I parks they were sharp maids

312
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,160
overseas and we had episodes for it yeah

313
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,770
I noticed the the net on the net bsd

314
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,860
post pages the Zoras sport is still

315
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,400
mentioned yeah a chance to flash in your

316
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,030
roles on older blackberry devices what

317
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,900
sorry

318
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,240
any chance to flush some of that

319
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,310
software on all the BlackBerry devices

320
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,370
Oh blackberry well I don't

321
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,870
didn't really works with blackberry so I

322
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,760
can't really say what you can do with

323
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,860
blackberry sorry voting question and we

324
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,520
tried putting it to well cartridge based

325
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,100
systems where you put in a cartridge and

326
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,530
well it gives you additional RAM or well

327
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,710
storage to run as os's because I think

328
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,240
if you run a browser tabs well we all

329
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,550
know that tabs stick around I think that

330
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,530
these cartridges would actually well

331
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,140
benefit well the browser would benefit

332
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,160
from the car musical well you mean for I

333
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,870
think I'm stuck in console's are my yeah

334
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,420
well some people are so question was did

335
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,870
you try to port these things using

336
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,260
cartridges on devices well it's mostly

337
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,490
consoles and Atari ST or maybe on the

338
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,280
atari amiga you usually you have an

339
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,620
accelerator board with a lot of RAM so

340
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,390
it's not really that much of a concern

341
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,930
because the Falcon was like 14 Meg's

342
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,510
Meg's of RAM so it's bit small so yeah

343
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,150
but for the consoles actually yeah I

344
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,410
didn't really look into it basically

345
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,170
because I'm not really a gamer myself

346
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,450
but yeah i think i've seen thoroughout

347
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,660
step for the consoles you probably can

348
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,180
find it as well which you start with as

349
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,950
main storage was for most people to not

350
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,800
consider supporting anything

351
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,520
so yeah the carriage graduated catfishes

352
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,490
sorry usually our bank memories you had

353
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:36,000
to switch banks and yeah but yeah but

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,770
usually it's it was a bit slower

355
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,720
depending on the country some were

356
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,340
actually replacing the CPU like symbols

357
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,380
which I mentioned which is an operating

358
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,480
system for the said ATM machines like

359
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,860
hands tried and so basically it works

360
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,460
much better better with an add-in card

361
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,400
which actually replaces the CPU and so

362
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:22,620
yeah so question was you mentioned well

363
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,230
Kentucky and web browser our C client

364
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,750
there's an email client as well so how

365
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,850
do we connect them to the Internet on

366
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,410
them well you can use I mentioned serial

367
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,570
ports so you can run SLI PE or maybe

368
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:46,350
even PP people I'm not sure yeah SLI P

369
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,480
is way you know if you don't need to log

370
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,230
in with the password on whatever and yes

371
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,780
there are also cartridges with an it

372
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,870
Ethernet chip and it's actually some of

373
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,790
them actually have their own IP stack on

374
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,010
them so you can actually just send send

375
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,730
them the

376
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,650
yes you can actually use a modem which

377
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,350
basically is this a device of our serial

378
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,630
line yeah and there used to be a c64 web

379
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,600
server running Contiki it probably still

380
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,720
runs so you can actually access webpages

381
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:57,970
served from a c64 machine yes so yes

382
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,460
there's an extension cartridge with SD

383
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,610
card slot and Ethernet card there are

384
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,110
also I didn't mention because I was

385
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,559
talking desktop but there are floppy

386
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,200
disk emulators that you just like to

387
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,450
replace the physical floppy drive and

388
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,090
you can just put an SD card in so you

389
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,919
can actually have plenty of software and

390
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:36,309
then yes sorry I've got to run top of

391
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,280
Linux oh yeah you you bought it RISC OS

392
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,470
on top of the linings yes but that's

393
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,679
interesting I think I need to see this

394
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,190
yeah yeah thank you have a question yeah

395
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,750
here yeah

396
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,730
yeah I have a friend which does have a

397
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,200
fire B so it's it's really nice it's a

398
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,929
sorry no unfortunately yeah don't yeah

399
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,110
but it's it's small it's it's funny it

400
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,000
has a anything odd battery so you can

401
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,309
actually just unplug it and it can still

402
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:50,820
burn for an hour or so so yeah so I

403
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,370
didn't mention Apple too well Kentucky

404
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,929
has been ported to Apple too

405
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,070
I think I've seen what was it called GE

406
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,010
OS or something I'm not sure it's free

407
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,029
so far north no it's not yeah okay well
