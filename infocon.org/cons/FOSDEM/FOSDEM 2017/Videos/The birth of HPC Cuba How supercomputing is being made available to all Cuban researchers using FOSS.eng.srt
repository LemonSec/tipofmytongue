1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,599
next up is

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,069
so Hector and bitter we're gonna talk

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,969
about the birth of HPC in Cuba hmm good

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,500
morning my name is Aaron I happy to be

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,100
here to tell you what we are doing for

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,640
for making a PC service available for q1

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,430
scientists the laws you can see

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,600
institutions that are supporting our

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
Pruitt's the build us that is the

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
Flemish University Council also with red

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,129
dots you is a collaboration project with

12
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,710
Flemish University and six human

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,020
universities were three of the harbour

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,950
involve display the week called HPC Cuba

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,059
we want to make a p-series service

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,750
available for all Q and scientists so

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,470
our mission is to provide centralized

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,820
access to HPC infrastructure also to

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,780
offer training to our HPC staff and also

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,090
to support our users belonging to the

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,060
higher education system also to earth

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,710
research institution in Coover the HPC

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,329
Cuba Prewitt that we can also call to

24
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,390
Center for academic supercomputing it

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,680
was thought with Yaffe distribution of

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,950
the HPC infrastructure in three main

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,060
points in Habana Santa Clara and

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,700
Santiago de Cuba in three universities

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,939
the University of infirmary science in

30
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,009
Havana the Central University of Las

31
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,840
Pinas in Santa Clara University of

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,939
Oriental in Santiago de Cuba

33
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,180
so facts about Cuba so Cuba is the

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,049
biggest island the Caribbean also with

35
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,329
the tropical climates it's a dual

36
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,390
destination also they our high

37
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,510
educational standard is true so we are

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,940
friendly people so

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,410
is also a safest place in America but we

40
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,430
are still living upon the USA embargo so

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,560
it calls also on limitation lie the

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,680
language also received access to the

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,780
information in internet because some

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,950
sites are broken our Qi piece so also

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,830
the artists to the infrastructure become

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,720
problematic sometimes it's the Americans

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,150
locking their sites for Cuban access

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,920
it's not the Cuban government blocking

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,020
the access for the Cuban population it's

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,280
the other way around many people think

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,480
if thank you for the clarification that

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
this is Cuba we are very close to us say

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,720
Florida so you can files them up okay

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,200
this boy idea starting in 2015 when we

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,630
saw two more HPC clusters one in Santa

56
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,600
Clara is Herbie and the other one in

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
Oriental University in the eastern part

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,300
of the country but our goal is to

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,250
provide the access to the whole country

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,430
now it's turning a new one in Havana in

61
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,300
the university of informal science maybe

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,940
you have heard about the leanest nova

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,400
distribution de was was the world there

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,280
but also in Cuba you can take a walk

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
riding nice old cars

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,900
I enjoy this mark on during the evening

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,440
so in Santa Clara you can find the

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,300
central university of latvia with very

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,670
nice university campus in aberdeen

70
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,560
natural environment with a lot of

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,080
streets also you can find beautiful

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,290
beaches in the north code of the

73
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,108
province so in kayo Santa Maria or we

74
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,720
have heard many workshops regarding ICT

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,050
in Oriente is also a nice place with a

76
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,900
very friendly people were been young

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,590
virgins become Q ones

78
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,600
immediately so it's difficult to

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,300
recognize to deter but maybe because he

80
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,420
is taller than Cubans so highlighted in

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,030
red the HBC closer in University of

82
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,990
Oriental also in University of Las

83
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,730
Villas what we are doing right now so

84
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,030
our plan now immediately for 2017 is to

85
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,140
insert to IBM a clustered with the

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,060
capacity of about seat 600 course I want

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,210
Arab Iran in Havana and Santa Clara also

88
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,620
in Santa Clara a bit data cluster with

89
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:24,960
20 servers and two NVIDIA GPU cards in

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,050
Oriental University a Dell server with

91
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,030
similar they're closer sorry with

92
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,390
similar capacity ball using infinite

93
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,940
Valentin orgy for the interconnectivity

94
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,750
so that is what we are talking about so

95
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,810
what was this in Oriente was already

96
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,480
start were either Jo order specialists

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,680
are working hard

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,270
mmm-hmm to make this possible so there

99
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,760
is our goal for for this year market the

100
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,330
hardware is donated by Ghent University

101
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,130
it's impossible for Kim universities to

102
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,520
buy IBM or Dell or HP hardware it's

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,460
illegal for Dell to export to Cuba if

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,560
Adele salesperson cells to accumulate

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,130
her university you lose this job okay

106
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,900
but okay with collaboration with the

107
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,340
Flemish universities we've been able to

108
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,700
establish some infrastructure in human

109
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,990
so everything we are using is free

110
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,939
software so so far we have Debian as

111
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,590
operating system using Turkey PBS and

112
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,680
Maui for managing Kiwis and jobs also

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,029
using a gunked-up for monitoring

114
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,560
purposes but we are exploring a new

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,509
alternative for the new implementation

116
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,960
may be using scent of flu maybe or

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,830
anything so that is what we are thinking

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:17,400
about we are exploring to do that we

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,310
have offered web portals to support

120
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,740
users so this is another example in

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,650
University of orienting also a wiki and

122
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,599
sorry for the language scores for

123
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,560
queuing users also building different

124
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,860
ways to access to the cluster of for

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,889
monitoring purposes for example you can

126
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,949
access using SSH for Luke the Cubist

127
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,449
state you can do that also using the web

128
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,360
interface the same for the job states

129
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,439
it's more comfortable for no IT user to

130
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,620
use the web access and also we are

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,409
creating zone templates for a script

132
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,879
tool so many jobs in the word web via

133
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,430
web also is possible so now we can see

134
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,909
how many institutions in Cuba are using

135
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:31,379
our HTC facilities also you can find so

136
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,479
a user from be weak so I have no idea

137
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,299
what he's doing our poster but ok it's

138
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,779
here also people from

139
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,879
Brazilian from Brazilian University

140
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,490
because you are helping off we are

141
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,300
helping resilient guys so so we are

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,759
happy with that with the uses we are

143
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,399
that it's a lot of EQ my University in

144
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,749
University so we have infrastructure in

145
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,279
the three main the biggest three main

146
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,769
universities of the island and as you

147
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,269
can see the infrastructure is working

148
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,949
well already on a high level using

149
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,259
nothing but free and open source

150
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,170
solutions and all kinds of institutions

151
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,930
and research institutes are using

152
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,129
already our infrastructure ok so some

153
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:36,759
examples at different resorts accusing

154
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,180
our HPC for a sample for a video

155
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,350
encoding in the Q one detail television

156
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,339
broadcasting for example also for sign

157
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,949
are processing uses neural net neural

158
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:54,579
networks for health applications also

159
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:56,889
from the environment also for the

160
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,800
chemistry application where they

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,259
couldn't do the job with the very good

162
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:05,170
lat talk with CCG around it was not

163
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,059
possible but in our closing oriented

164
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,430
University in 50 minutes it would solve

165
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,519
so all scientific papers so it used to

166
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,050
have an idea that our scientists in Cuba

167
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,689
are using our what we are doing so now

168
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,759
we have a national strategy that

169
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,120
includes capacity building so it would

170
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,509
be important for us to train our HTC

171
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,679
staff developing training or work shows

172
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,470
it could be in Cuba or in Verger also

173
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,889
supporting the users and establishment

174
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,459
of synergies with our institution so is

175
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,470
this our national study this is it was

176
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,670
our our first

177
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,990
worship in Santa Clara the participation

178
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,870
of HPC as perform gain University was

179
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,190
sponsored by Blair so we can see Alvaro

180
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,240
you can see here

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,200
so our is here so Albert would be very

182
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,750
good reference of Cuba our job also rudy

183
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,570
is here and dieter okay of course but

184
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,880
also some people from Ecuador Peru were

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,670
trying because it had regional inputs

186
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:47,140
also of course for our national strategy

187
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,709
we had to face some drawbacks for

188
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,820
example the language also also they

189
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,970
access policy because sometimes the SSH

190
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,380
port our rocket when you go from another

191
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,380
institution to another so we have to to

192
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,740
face that also broadcast we have and

193
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,579
score the US a trade embargo is still

194
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,370
present and nobody knows what would Ron

195
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,250
do in the future regarding Cuba so we

196
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,269
are to see but now we are we are focus

197
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,209
and to develop centralized

198
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,630
authentication system with a national

199
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,140
from and also to improve our grades our

200
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,980
storage capacity train our people make

201
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,940
easier the users installation by using

202
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,050
so facility that we will show now this

203
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,260
is our user management approach with

204
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,769
national front end with centralized

205
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,079
authentication with redundancy also the

206
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,790
login nodes are connected to the head of

207
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,660
the cluster and also access to scratch

208
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,870
using InfiniBand

209
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,940
to the home of the user over the data

210
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,000
user Novi City so it is a that so

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,320
actually the the infrastructure is

212
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,330
working at the separate universities and

213
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,710
what you're working on now is like a

214
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,050
layer on top of that national user

215
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,820
accounts so if you have a user account

216
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,790
for HPC Cuba at your home university you

217
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,920
can access infrastructure at another

218
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,670
University also for making easier the

219
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,900
installation for users we are trying to

220
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,150
use easy would were we say that we

221
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,910
already have a Cuban contribution to the

222
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,910
easy build a community developing the

223
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,610
Jade for example I know that Canada can

224
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,730
have been our guide and also supervisor

225
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,890
our developers so we are also working in

226
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,450
helping sunset with the Clipper open

227
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,560
phones so maybe Kenny can spray much

228
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,380
more okay so it's a sample of the 88

229
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,529
installation the world for our staff

230
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:23,430
Akua so guys we need HPC as per like

231
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,920
youth to join us and this tree to make

232
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,029
it possible

233
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,880
okay so thank you very much for your

234
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,270
attention

235
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:41,669
[Applause]

236
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,110
well you see actually we're just we're

237
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,600
using the hardware that we can get our

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,700
hands on yes we don't really have to

239
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,190
Liberty to choose the hard way I'm just

240
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,050
happy to be sleepy these were good

241
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,850
clusters working very well at Ghent

242
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,660
University

243
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,160
they were decommissioned for all kinds

244
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,100
of reasons and instead of showing them

245
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,120
into the furnace we decided to export

246
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,680
them to Cuba and donate them to Cuban

247
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,410
University if you have another cluster

248
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,930
available for us please help us so just

249
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,690
wondering where can we find more

250
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,180
information about the ongoing projects

251
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,390
and that you're asking for HPC experts

252
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:21,300
to get involved please send us an email

253
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,000
so we have your email and then we can

254
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,770
see back yes in the future we are always

255
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,390
organizing trainings Cubans are coming

256
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,270
to Belgium seek accuracy right now

257
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,640
we are sending experts to Cuba every

258
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,470
time we have funds we get funding from

259
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,540
the Flemish Interuniversity Council and

260
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,070
the deal is basically that it's

261
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,860
volunteer work but you get your ticket

262
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,330
page your hotel there is paid to get a

263
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,490
per diem and what we see is people go

264
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,339
there and then they

265
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,050
for an extra week extra two weeks to go

266
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,509
on holiday that's just fine yeah we are

267
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:57,790
right now applying for for record so we

268
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,370
can promise anything but maybe for the

269
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,769
next year we can have some budgets

270
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,650
supporting our projects so we will need

271
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,559
some Europe passports to support also

272
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,380
teaching our stuff so our tuk can come

273
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,770
here and our trainers can go to Cuba

274
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,189
also

275
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,659
so the question is about the electricity

276
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,119
and do we use ups or do we generate our

277
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,509
own electricity well the experience is

278
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:42,779
that the electricity in Cuba is unstable

279
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,999
it's very normal to have small outages

280
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:49,169
we use UPS mostly to stabilize the the

281
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,090
mains current and we have generators

282
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,360
also yeah but outages are quite common

283
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,950
so where we use UPS also some inverters

284
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,179
with batteries it's nice at the UPS of

285
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,679
course also generators

286
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,499
[Music]

287
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,240
so the question is maybe we should focus

288
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,940
on open hardware or open the open BC

289
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,700
infrastructure instead of looking for us

290
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,790
Archer providers yeah we can look into

291
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,850
it but for right now I think financially

292
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,820
it would be very difficult for us to

293
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,530
start building or to start looking in

294
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,140
that direction from up until now we've

295
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,380
depended on three hardware free is

296
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,980
always cheaper than then maybe open can

297
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,130
be

298
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,150
okay it could be used for anybody so we

299
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,120
are focused mainly now in this first

300
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,750
step in scientific community because are

301
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,940
the people that have more needs well HPC

302
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,460
but for one of the example that I'd

303
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,760
shoulder regarding to the video encoding

304
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,250
for the national q1 DITA television

305
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,820
broadcasting is know for scientific

306
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,710
purposes it was for storage the the

307
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,610
materials in the format that their needs

308
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,340
also for the broadcasting to the Cuban

309
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,820
people

310
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,920
No

311
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:32,759
[Applause]
