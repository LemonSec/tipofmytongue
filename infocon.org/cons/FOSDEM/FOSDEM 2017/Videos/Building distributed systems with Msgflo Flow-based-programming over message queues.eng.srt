1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,900
okay at least you get a little tour of

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,070
flow hub so that's not the button I want

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,198
and we are not on Locust

4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,990
and yes if I can do this first that's a

5
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,680
good point okay now I have that

6
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,640
yeah now where is the

7
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,799
okay we're connected so that's a good

8
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,130
start

9
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:32,780
am is my stomach a yes there is some IOT

10
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,570
devices here just dev board esp8266

11
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,280
another one modems you so same chip

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,929
they're just connected to battery and

13
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,600
they're all on Wi-Fi into using my phone

14
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,940
as a hotspot kind of bridging it because

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,649
this is actually a nice portable way

16
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,090
then you don't have to like reconfigure

17
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,220
your devices just it works for a

18
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,090
personal network and we're using MQTT to

19
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,289
communicate the broker in MQTT which are

20
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,850
those things are talking to is running

21
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,189
on my laptop normally that would be your

22
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,780
IOT gateway could be a Raspberry Pi

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,590
could be route to whatever and then on

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,180
my kind of developer machine in this

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,299
case is this one which is familiar to me

26
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:17,780
with the SAT keyword and and stuff we

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,519
have kind of our development environment

28
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,290
so this is actually a little bit good

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,340
that you have to do this switcheroo

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,570
because it's showing now that I'm on a

31
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,690
different device do doing the UI parts

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,790
than the actual runtime this is a normal

33
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,019
case where you in the deployment you're

34
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,310
not gonna have a foo IDE and this kind

35
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,989
of stuff when your Raspberry Pi whatever

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,640
it might not have a screen and so on

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,269
so I'm connected over WebSockets stuff

38
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:53,260
okay so I hope we will have some devices

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,280
yes we have I have two two devices and

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,630
they just have a couple of different

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,240
things I've one attached to the reader

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,860
on it that's the red board right here

43
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,740
and it actually has a LED also on the

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,430
DVLA so that's it's called everybody

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,540
input and because we're communicating

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:36,810
over and Qt I need to like that and

47
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,160
devices are not just sitting there

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,680
they're publishing I can see here and I

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
can see that they are saying yellow I'm

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,920
here and this kind of stuff and yes so

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,210
what should be possible now a second for

52
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,330
instance tape the button here and

53
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,010
connected to the relay itself so now

54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,510
that I'm clicking the button this thing

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,220
is actually kind of talking to itself

56
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,400
over and ktt okay that's something you

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,959
may be a bit maybe you have a light

58
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,120
which is actually hard hard wire you

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,620
know okay not the most generally useful

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,418
thing so the device is somewhere else

61
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,500
you know so now I just have led to show

62
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,510
now it's connected to do this thing

63
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,200
so we can live rewire the system to in

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,140
order to to change connections this

65
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,130
could be like setting up the initial

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,440
thing or it could be like just changing

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,150
how you like things like I don't really

68
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,700
like that I have to go to that device to

69
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,530
trigger that thing or this kind of

70
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,650
things

71
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,630
so that's changing connections we can

72
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,370
also add more components so classical

73
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,630
stuff that happens now at the old time

74
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,630
is the compatibility of devices and then

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,370
you need like okay take this Jason thing

76
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,890
take us message and make it work or you

77
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,230
you want to have some functionality a

78
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,700
lot of the ideas which I will go through

79
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,180
it's about like avoid

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,680
expansion out in your system build

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,560
devices that'll do something sensors and

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,930
actuators and then build the system

83
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,789
together in a flexible way for instance

84
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,199
using a tool like this you see because

85
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:27,199
this has a lot of benefits so from okay

86
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,330
I'm not gonna like I had a sample code

87
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,490
but it's on that machine so it's free

88
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,229
but I actually have the components so

89
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,000
you could go here create a new component

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,539
and write your code I'll show you if I

91
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,570
even if I'm not using that in word just

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,280
go to we support a bunch of different

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,169
languages and it's really easy to add

94
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:45,500
more

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,050
with message from confuse computer

96
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,280
escaped again

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,840
also C++ Python anything like that so

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,759
it's nice to that's the wrong key when

99
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
you create that component actually we

100
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,270
live we can instantiate it so I have

101
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,020
done this before

102
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:13,639
and I have it's not showing here I hope

103
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,240
it's towards so for instance I have this

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:27,340
component just in between here and now

105
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm not pressing it and off when I am

106
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,440
pressing it so this is just super simple

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,669
I mean of course you can have as

108
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:35,840
complicated stuff you want you have a

109
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,630
free programming language short many

110
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,220
Python JavaScript and so on

111
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,039
so this is also nice because it always

112
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,560
happens even if you have the system

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,580
that's kind of designed to work together

114
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,479
there's always a little and that's all

115
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,099
like it's a very pragmatic solution to

116
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,990
this like this we don't try to make a

117
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,130
universal way of doing things like just

118
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,020
okay so that stuff don't work this way

119
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,360
this stuff work this way build something

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,340
to play it together and we have some

121
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,830
testing tools also automated testing the

122
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,710
views the message queue so you can kind

123
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,340
of you have can have good faith that it

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,439
definitely will work

125
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,150
ceefor time okay I do a little bit more

126
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,990
demo let's have this timer component we

127
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,590
have a turbo component and generally

128
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,030
message for you the participant

129
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,680
shouldn't do much when there are enough

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,780
now nothing happens but if I specify an

131
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,990
interval hundred milliseconds now we

132
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,909
have this blinking light whatever so

133
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,169
that's actually stateful component you

134
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,520
know it remembers okay we were off

135
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,050
before now we need to go on and so on

136
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,819
and you can do this as well so this

137
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,680
could be it could be complicated stuff

138
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,810
like talking to a database finding what

139
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,539
this message should mean and doing it

140
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,029
live talking to the internet and some

141
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:02,400
service and so on and also this shows

142
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,449
that we can change the configuration

143
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,199
data right so basically working with the

144
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,569
user experience it's sometimes hard to

145
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,189
predict what's the right values of

146
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,580
things you know like maybe one you know

147
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,949
this is kind of one second showing

148
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:21,629
activity but not stressing people so you

149
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,250
can kind of explore your way to find out

150
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,080
maybe 1200 is the right word it's just

151
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,419
showing that you can derive things there

152
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:37,880
yes that's it for demo demo first

153
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,910
my slides are nothing up yes and we are

154
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,490
as I said we are talking here it's all

155
00:08:50,490 --> 00:09:00,000
mqtt I will oh all the time

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,140
I trade you one

157
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,839
yes and so this is where you find the

158
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,670
source code for message flow we also

159
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,140
have a new website now message for dot

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,529
org I put my slides here cuz that's nice

161
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:30,120
I hope there is a PDF reader yes so the

162
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,190
typical way you do MPT communication

163
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,740
you're sending on some topics and their

164
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,390
names and depending on the like both

165
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,730
when you send receive and then you're

166
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,019
just you can't do anything else so

167
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,209
instead what we do so you have a system

168
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,740
account can we do basically one thing

169
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,440
and it's it's you can't see this this

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
what how is it working well it's it's

171
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,950
sending stuff it's all digging into the

172
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,110
code using form you can see it easily

173
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,310
and how it works we send so we phases we

174
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,890
send the button sends on button

175
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,079
something not directly to the motor or

176
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,930
the light because this way it has his

177
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,670
own namespace and then something else

178
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,740
like floral or you can use a hard call a

179
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,529
list of two mappings or whatever

180
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,610
connects them together and this gives

181
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,500
you the flexibility to reorganize it and

182
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,180
with message flow you can do it live

183
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,279
which is nice in addition we send a

184
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,930
discovering message so we send

185
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,670
information each device sending

186
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,890
information how and describing itself

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,480
like what is the component this kind of

188
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,010
like so I can have many of the same

189
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,380
components each there are each in a

190
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,709
different role so one can be a there's a

191
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:39,180
motor button one and so this is

192
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,730
reflecting their very purpose but it's

193
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,170
not hard coded so you can still like

194
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,899
rewire and then it says something about

195
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,110
its ports so like this is a kind of data

196
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,899
flow flow based programming model for

197
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,540
how to do the cues so the mqtt queue is

198
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,670
actually this thing here so that's how

199
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,790
it on the wire it's communicating and

200
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,610
then yeah you can use this little FTP

201
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,350
DSL to connect things together I'm

202
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,940
connecting the first state of a

203
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,430
imaginary button to a start of a motor

204
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,199
and the motor could say when it's

205
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,649
running there's a say to another lamp

206
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,260
that makes it read the warning so you

207
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,029
know that's potentially dangerous and so

208
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,829
on you can use this tool to set it up so

209
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:20,830
that's

210
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,720
kind of how you would like that's

211
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,550
without like the live initial

212
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,180
programming part and what about devices

213
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,769
that message flow as long as you talk

214
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,180
mqtt or

215
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,910
AMQP which we also support you can have

216
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,709
if you kind of declare this information

217
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,370
about how it how would care works

218
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,140
separately in any AMA file and then you

219
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,690
can have this tool send it on behalf of

220
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,579
the device so this is a way to you have

221
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,600
your existing mqtt things appear and be

222
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,610
connectable in this way of course

223
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,430
sometimes they are hard-coded there is

224
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,740
not much you can do then it's need

225
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,510
something to maybe change the codon and

226
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,420
demonstrated then you run message flow

227
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,120
with your initial graph so like what's

228
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,730
the basic stuff you open your browser as

229
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,160
I said you buy this have never touched

230
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,810
before if you just load the browser and

231
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,730
connect to the right IP to us then you

232
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,990
can do it and I think it's old

233
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,910
connection information is in the URL in

234
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,480
the URL

235
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,640
so we're saying okay please open the IDE

236
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,600
up for a while and please IDE connect on

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,220
WebSocket to this address so you can

238
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,980
actually have a QR code or NFC token

239
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,630
where you go Boop and it comes up

240
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,180
directly on your tablet your laptop or

241
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,490
you just need to send this discovery

242
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,680
message to make stuff work with my

243
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,230
sister or in token PTT but there are

244
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,670
also this Khomeini's language which you

245
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,990
can use to to make it nice and easy

246
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,930
we have JavaScript modules no flow it's

247
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,790
not a visual programming environment I

248
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,779
will probably run time for 12 Q's see

249
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,089
pass pass by P Audrina I'm using Arduino

250
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,510
here I use Python in the example and one

251
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,310
other example was JavaScript we have a

252
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,100
rest one which clearly only supports mkp

253
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,610
so it's

254
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,070
yes so for the current status is that

255
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,240
the programming model we've actually

256
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,760
been using this a lot like how this is

257
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,180
set up together in on back-end services

258
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,060
for call systems and they were using mqp

259
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,950
and that's really well dust away running

260
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,020
millions of jobs every week through the

261
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,970
system and it works really well we're

262
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,980
primarily using the JavaScript and no

263
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,260
flow libraries that's really battle

264
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
testing works well thank you TT we

265
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,490
haven't do so much yet so it's a little

266
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,330
bit rougher we have some small

267
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,360
deployments in hackers business so of

268
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,130
MQTT with message flow in see base in

269
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:55,850
Berlin and so like you know you can you

270
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,350
can use it for stuff like programming

271
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,270
like a demo now it's not so much tested

272
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,280
but it's also not part of the you know

273
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,710
the the core production system we stay

274
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,840
out of the the there as much as we can

275
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,570
so it it's not maybe have developer

276
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,770
doesn't have the best experience but the

277
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,530
system works

278
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,210
MQTT SSL support the message flow is

279
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,250
actually not tested this is a one thing

280
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,310
that might cause you to want to wait a

281
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,870
little bit to do a real deployment

282
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,240
because you need as a cell to securely

283
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,130
do your authentication on mosquito for

284
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,870
instance yes future so right now on MQTT

285
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,630
mosquito which is the most common broker

286
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,120
and in the protocol it's not know

287
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
routing is specified so we use rabbit

288
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,550
and mqp we actually ask rabbit to say

289
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,290
okay connect this thing to that thing

290
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,750
so we are staying out of the the kind of

291
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,410
for communication path however on skeety

292
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,150
there is no standard for this so we have

293
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,070
our own that's actually running in our

294
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,630
own process and you would like to to

295
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,839
kind of get rid of that so we want to

296
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,830
support web team queue routing also

297
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,530
intuitive because they support our and

298
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,150
then the code that we currently have

299
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,180
will probably separate out as its own

300
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,050
kind of

301
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,470
like well-tested router Franchitti t's

302
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,209
so that if you run mosquito which

303
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,380
doesn't have this functionality you can

304
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,190
plug this in and you can you can work

305
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,230
yeah there are some changes we want to

306
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,000
do more with the how we visualize data

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,769
in Feb so you can kind of see the data

308
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,420
flowing through there's a PR for this

309
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,579
open right now which would give you like

310
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,170
it at least the text stream of messages

311
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,940
coming through which is very nice

312
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,890
because sometimes you know documentation

313
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,420
is slightly wrong it says it sends on

314
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,040
this polite but you know actually do not

315
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,230
and it's really nice to to be able to

316
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,709
see that directly the big things we want

317
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,089
to do is you want to take this

318
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,430
programming model which we which works

319
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,320
now for connecting stuff together we

320
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,980
actually have a microcontroller runtime

321
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,589
which you can program live like the

322
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,990
logic internally on with the rice do we

323
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,880
like to expose so you can have this big

324
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,130
Network this device dog flap device it's

325
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,779
like how this stuff to us actually work

326
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:08,089
or has a bug whatever you go in to that

327
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,890
node and then you see the network inside

328
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,329
and you can change it so that's the big

329
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,339
big things and also we have a couple of

330
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,690
tiny changes we would like to do to the

331
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,310
protocol before we call it message for

332
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:48,980
one point cuz that's would be a yes and

333
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,399
it's also you find that that's on the

334
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,610
move

335
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,329
rise actually code should be renamed

336
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,529
sign up there and you can use that to

337
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:01,430
target other things to market

338
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,280
controllers you can just I'm programming

339
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,650
with it to be image processing with its

340
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,490
and stuff like this so that's

341
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,559
[Music]

342
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,960
no well we it's like if so if you would

343
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
send that discovery message that little

344
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,400
Jason side thing sorry if we support

345
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,740
micro Python on the SP we don't but if

346
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,470
you would use the existing mqtt support

347
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,570
in microfiber and just send that Jason

348
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,820
[Music]

349
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,730
the question was SSL is not been tested

350
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,690
is it like nothing started we are using

351
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,060
existing libraries for MQTT support so

352
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,490
they have as a cell support both in ojs

353
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,930
in python and so on so we're using power

354
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:02,890
on - Enzo so like I think

355
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,349
[Music]

356
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,410
for example they used earth and tiny the

357
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,520
tweetIn is vertical which makes a pretty

358
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,470
nice feel for the libraries I've seen

359
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,820
some for v-neck if you want I think I

360
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,780
know you try to get the job done by

361
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,100
external library or you might look at

362
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,650
yeah so the commenters have you look at

363
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,169
Cerf as an alternative to SSL encryption

364
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,600
for community and mqtt we're kind of

365
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,480
relying on what the broker supports and

366
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,010
unless they can talk together and as far

367
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,090
as I know mosquito only supports TLS 1.0

368
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,549
so probably that will be limitation this

369
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,290
also the end-to-end encryption which is

370
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,179
also I think quite interesting it's a

371
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,600
separate topic that is very nice because

372
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,070
then you can send through an untrusted

373
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,840
Network so it's not about making your

374
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,850
network secure it's not sending securely

375
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,490
over a secure Network and there

376
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,049
definitely something like curve and

377
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,900
these the sign for embedded encryption

378
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,669
is very very interesting and Mexico

379
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,799
actually doesn't care about the the

380
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,470
payload that you send between because we

381
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,450
read you have a slight slight preference

382
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,429
for Jason but you can send buffers of

383
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,290
the arbitrate stuff so that means you

384
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,090
can you can do this without changing any

385
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,669
other code yes thanks a lot for

386
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,410
presentation

387
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,289
