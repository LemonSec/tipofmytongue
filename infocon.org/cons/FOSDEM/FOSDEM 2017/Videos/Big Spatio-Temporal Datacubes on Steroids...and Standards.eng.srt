1
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,460
okay so from my side unmuted

2
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,820
good let's give it a try

3
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,700
I don't want to yell at you so I'm

4
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,100
starting cautiously I don't know whether

5
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,040
the microphone is on it's just for

6
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,850
recording yeah okay good so I start here

7
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,320
with so thank you for having me here

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,149
I'm Peter Peter Bowman and what I'm

9
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,430
going to present you is actually joint

10
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,610
work of several people in my group one

11
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,710
of them in particular Demeter my chef

12
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,500
whose PhD thesis is engaged in that work

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,220
as well

14
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,530
but I would have to take a long list

15
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,280
actually to be honest to give proper

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,590
credit to everybody who has contributed

17
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,139
to that I know the least of course also

18
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,910
the standardization bodies where we had

19
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,920
lots of discussion gave me a lot of

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,540
opportunity to learn things as I'm just

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,640
a plain computer scientists but has

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,700
stumbled into geo world and that's it

23
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,170
what I want to talk about about

24
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,799
multi-dimensional data that appear is

25
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:30,840
spatial temporal data cubes so we have

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,090
this funny term of coverage this is

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,900
age-old

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,040
actually only if you remember that it

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,070
originally was invented by s3 for a

30
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,200
particular data structure but meantime

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
it's decoupled from that and they

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,860
themselves were surprised to discover

33
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,570
what coverages have become in the

34
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,660
meantime coverage is catch-all terms

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,190
that actually relates to feature you

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,260
know in OTC standardization world a

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,970
feature is a geographic object in the

38
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,400
end something that has some location

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,579
space and time attached then we have a

40
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,280
special kind of feature that is a

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,590
coverage a coverage is defined as

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,600
something that may sound really strange

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,829
a spacetime varying phenomena that wants

44
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,170
to express something specific if you

45
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,690
look at say a highway here and you take

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,970
the a1 if your model that is a vector

47
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,730
then obviously the attribute a1 will be

48
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,949
invariant over the full size over the

49
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,750
full length of this highway it will be

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,780
a1 so it's sort of static attributes

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,380
that are

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,620
yeah however if you take some image and

53
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,230
walk from one location to another the

54
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,400
value changes and that is what this

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,070
expression wants to say it changes as

56
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,490
you go from one element to another it's

57
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,380
pretty clear that this kind of thing

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,320
requires more storage space and

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,090
therefore the big data that we encounter

60
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,800
at least big in terms of volume

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,340
typically our coverages not so much

62
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,680
vectors and actually it's not raster

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,420
data only if you think about that one

64
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,360
but you could generalize that as regular

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
and irregular grids as point clouds and

66
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,230
measures we can sort of make this a

67
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,100
little bit more graphic more spicy so we

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,470
have the feature and we have some

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,600
abstract coverage which actually has

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,370
several subtypes if you will which also

71
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,290
reflects history we have the grid

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,180
coverages the first knife attempt run

73
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,540
about 2004 that is not very much used

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,460
today and particularly not with geo

75
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,070
coordinates because it has some

76
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,360
difficulties I have word the word flow

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,930
here we had to improve on that I got the

78
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,700
rectified coverage which is an author

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,140
image so rectilinear grids and then the

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,210
rest of it all was termed a reference or

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,310
group you see I cannot even pronounce it

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,580
reference about great coverage nobody

83
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,140
could explain me why that term was

84
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,260
chosen it's a little bit difficult but

85
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,900
it means irregular grids in the end so

86
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,420
everything else that is historically

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,990
development like rings in a tree

88
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,190
actually we supersede this currently

89
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,440
with the coverage implementation schema

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,900
1.1 where we introduced a general great

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,150
coverage which brings all these

92
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,460
historical developments together into

93
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,900
something that is easier to handle

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,920
easier to understand and in particular

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,610
one singer concept and that is what

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,280
typically is known as data cubes that is

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,120
some erase some roster sets that have

98
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,590
two dimensions three dimensions four

99
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,650
dimensions five or whatever and as you

100
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,940
can see there can

101
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,800
straight lines like also images it can

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,410
be curvilinear like measures following a

103
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,810
coastline or the syringe things that

104
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,840
people do in climate modeling all of

105
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,030
that falls into that category but it

106
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,620
doesn't stop there because in the end

107
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,570
its point in space that just happened to

108
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,170
have a particular condition constraint

109
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,110
that they all have neighbors if you

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,660
don't have that if you give up that when

111
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,250
you come to multi-point coverages that

112
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,010
is point clouds if you add curves so

113
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,230
bangles of trajectories could be a multi

114
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,510
curve coverage and so on multi surface

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,670
coverage multi solid coverage this is

116
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,410
actually where we close the gap to city

117
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,640
modeling for example city GML also to

118
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,680
CID computer-aided design so we do not

119
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,270
really remember ears we just want to

120
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,730
close gaps this is an abstract concept

121
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,280
and that has been defined in OGC

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,140
abstract topic six which is identical to

123
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,620
ISO 19123 abstract in the sense it does

124
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,720
not prescribe a particular

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,520
implementation which means you can have

126
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,830
divergent implementations and you find

127
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,080
that out there so if somebody says I'm

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,290
into or probably because I'm

129
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,250
implementing 19123

130
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,810
wrong you find diverging implementations

131
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,850
out there and you have a very simple

132
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,440
criterion they all come with their own

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
client because crisscross coupling does

134
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,250
not work therefore otc has added

135
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,410
concrete coverage implementation schema

136
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,830
which is a concretization that makes a

137
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,419
few assumptions so that it becomes

138
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,430
interoperable and actually we can do

139
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,380
conformance testing down to the level of

140
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,690
single pixels saying whether an

141
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,540
implementation is correct or not in this

142
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,470
sense it's concrete and then you can use

143
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,800
client a to access server B that is

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
possibly indeed and that has been done

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,300
so that is the general thing stepping

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,370
back a little bit we can bring that into

147
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,890
a very simple schema actually using UML

148
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,830
so it's a specialization of feature that

149
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,400
has domain set telling us where do our

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,669
values sit the range set which are the

151
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,220
values you see domain range it's like a

152
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,680
function mapping locations two values

153
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,710
and what we have added then over TML for

154
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,850
example is the data type what is the

155
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,380
data type of our values is the

156
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,570
temperature is it radians or whatever

157
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,000
else and this actually we took from

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,009
sweet common so actually now we have a

159
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,729
connection to sensor world so sensor

160
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,770
observations can be transformed into

161
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,320
coverages without loss of semantics here

162
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,530
that was important to us still there are

163
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,570
quite a few data that people want to

164
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,059
attach different ones depending on their

165
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,309
domain and so there is an option on

166
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,080
metadata package where I can put

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,700
anything else you want the coverage

168
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,740
doesn't understand it but it does

169
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,229
transport it for you so this is a way to

170
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,510
carry along all sort of specific

171
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,980
metadata that you want to remember if

172
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,800
you want to see that in CML okay here is

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,110
an example for it where you see the

174
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,360
domain set with a grip definition this

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,700
happens to be four-dimensional lat/long

176
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,940
hate and date so you have a regular axis

177
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,640
for that long you have an irregular axis

178
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
for hate with two levels in this case

179
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,070
and you have an irregular X's for time

180
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,950
also two levels I didn't want to write

181
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,880
more I was lazy

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,990
this is mapped to grid X's and then you

183
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,060
know we other points it and the point

184
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,190
values you have here in the range set

185
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,529
and down there in the range type you see

186
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,779
what that means for example it's

187
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,720
panchromatic we have radians reference

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,580
to it and we have the units of measure

189
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,900
and the kind of things that is the

190
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,170
historical way because GML just was

191
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,150
trendy at that time when it originated

192
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,230
but with CIS 1.1 if you favor curly

193
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,690
braces then here is the same thing in

194
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,040
jason domains that range set range type

195
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,860
and the good thing is that it has the

196
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,560
same semantics we can map it so you can

197
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,330
do a one-to-one mapping you are not

198
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,820
bound to a particular world of

199
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,100
standardization and if you are into

200
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,000
ontology and into reasoning then you may

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,140
want to enjoy the RDF representation

202
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,459
please look at it closely I will reverse

203
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,510
it afterwards

204
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,730
so we have different formats available

205
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,970
if you step back a little bit that means

206
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,730
we can encode our coverage into a single

207
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,949
file where we have domain set range that

208
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:29,160
orange type and the metadata and we are

209
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,199
informational e complete in the sense

210
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,180
that it covers it contains all of the

211
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,490
definition if you use some format like

212
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,970
Gmail chain or RDF find so far but

213
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,160
inefficient obviously you don't want to

214
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,260
transport 10 terabyte encoded in ASCII

215
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,199
not really so we need binary formats

216
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,930
okay that is defined as well with the

217
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,760
coverage standard you can use any of

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,699
those formats and this is a growing list

219
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,940
we have more and more mappings defined

220
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,320
obviously this is incomplete sometimes

221
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
geo TIF is not able to handle all of the

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,790
range type information for example but

223
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,310
ok you wanted you get it sometimes there

224
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,019
are reasons for that maybe you just want

225
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,610
to display in a browser so you pick a

226
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,769
PNG knowing that you will not get the

227
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,779
full information so that is not an

228
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,649
inconsistency that is meant this way

229
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,430
however sometimes we want to if both I

230
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,709
want to be informational a complete end

231
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,110
I want to encode efficiently therefore

232
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,260
we have a multi-part encoding where we

233
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,389
have a container concept that we have

234
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,519
some header which is some information le

235
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,880
complete format GML or Jason or RDF and

236
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,880
then you have links from particular

237
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,490
elements into other files and these

238
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,250
contain then say the pixel payload so

239
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,449
they can be stored efficiently ok so we

240
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,000
can use historically it was multi-part

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,329
mine in CS 1.0 but in future that can be

242
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,649
zip tha B to the save format you package

243
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,500
whatever we want and this concept

244
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,120
actually allows us also to introduce

245
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,010
collections of coverages to be

246
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,069
transported and it allows also to

247
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,050
introduce tiling multi-dimensional

248
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,630
tiling partitioning of objects some

249
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,630
formats support that already like QT for

250
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,569
example other stones now we have a way

251
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,880
to model that to represent that

252
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,899
regardless of the format so this is the

253
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,470
coverage is the data structure this data

254
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,440
structure actually

255
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,450
you served that many different services

256
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,310
we tend to to flee decapitate from the

257
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,390
web coverage service so a wfs and web

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,520
feature service can serve a coverage as

259
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,290
well because the coverage is a feature

260
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,210
in the end just depends on the

261
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,120
implementation so actually the coverages

262
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,280
can float between different services or

263
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
in other words can be passed on from one

264
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,740
to the next

265
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,690
for example from a sensor observation

266
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,120
service into a web coverage service and

267
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,340
so on okay

268
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,470
I will focus on the web coverage service

269
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,420
because that offers the dedicated

270
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,940
functionality specifically for the

271
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,140
coverages this WCS standard is organized

272
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,920
into set into a suite of standards not

273
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,110
to make life more complicated but

274
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,240
actually to make it easier because the

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,780
WCS core is very very simple it's about

276
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,280
the level of master thesis for a good

277
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,500
student to implement that as part of a

278
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,630
semester work and then you get something

279
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,200
that delivers a coverage or subset of it

280
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,390
subsetting means I can trim that is I do

281
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,880
a cut out but I retain the amount of

282
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,130
dimensions so 2d cut out from a 2d

283
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,220
coverage or it can be slicing which

284
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,920
reduces the number of dimensions so from

285
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,050
a three-dimensional image time serious

286
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,760
stack for example I take out a time

287
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,550
slice which then is 2d or I do a time

288
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,850
series analysis then I get out a

289
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,860
one-dimensional coverage so I can walk

290
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,570
myself through the dimensions and can

291
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,880
extract whatever I want to transport the

292
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,020
minimum amount to the client this you

293
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,330
get back in the store format if you

294
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,830
don't say anything but you also can

295
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,030
request a format conversion say into G

296
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,130
ot or you want the GMA representation

297
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,650
and the service can decide which format

298
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,150
it wants or want to support this is the

299
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,160
mandatory stuff then there are different

300
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,740
facets in the extensions functionality

301
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,900
facets which a service may or may not

302
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,000
implement that makes it simpler for

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,560
implementers because you don't have to

304
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,390
code a lot until you have something

305
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,910
ready but you can say I offer core and

306
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,490
I'm baack working on extensions

307
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,810
it's good for those who want to buy

308
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,710
implementation or a select and open

309
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,170
source implementation because they can

310
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,800
set up a list saying I need w CP WCS

311
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,230
core and I need the range subsetting

312
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,140
extension I need the CRS transformation

313
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,370
extension and then everybody knows

314
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,710
exactly what is necessary and so you can

315
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,240
negotiate and you have a clear

316
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,140
understanding of the functionality that

317
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,440
is to be delivered finally we have

318
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
application Pro profiles which is just

319
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,870
bespoke packaging of functionality for

320
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,640
different purposes currently we have

321
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,630
satellite imagery and metadata is in the

322
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,990
make so that is something that I'm using

323
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,090
we because we actually have done that

324
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm the editor of those things here and

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,670
so naturally we use our rastaman system

326
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,120
for something that is used for

327
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,320
implementing and so we also have the

328
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,300
implementation available but many others

329
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,020
do as well

330
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,870
so actually we get a common information

331
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,380
space where coverage services

332
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,470
interoperate okay five minutes left the

333
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,060
funny word has fun

334
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,140
rastaman raster data manager so that is

335
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,910
our vehicle that we are building a so

336
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,710
called a write a debase system that

337
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,320
enhances standard SQL with queries on

338
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,770
multi-dimensional arrays and behind that

339
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,480
pile streaming architecture which is

340
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,570
peer-to-peer so fully paralyzed without

341
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,860
single point of failure we always we are

342
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,600
on OST you life

343
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,020
OST you incubation was not where we

344
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,780
where both parties felt happy with so

345
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,750
that we have abandoned and what did I

346
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,590
want to say yes a couple of words just

347
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,790
to give you an overview of the

348
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,010
architecture we do a partitioning of

349
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,480
course which can be any sort of

350
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,210
partitioning to do optimization like

351
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,520
saying this particular region must be

352
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,470
really fast and for the rest just to

353
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,870
something meaningful your system we have

354
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,300
a parallel architecture where we have

355
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,410
split queries

356
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,480
over more than 1,000 cloud nodes and

357
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,660
this is our latest thing this year we

358
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,940
are going to be onboard a satellite big

359
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,790
fun for everybody in the team and I

360
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,980
hasten to say these interfaces are not

361
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,380
for end users we can discuss a lot about

362
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,690
get versus the rest versus post or so

363
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,970
but actually I don't care this is all

364
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,069
just internal interfaces people want to

365
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,069
use their comfort zone they are tools

366
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,680
and so actually it's important that we

367
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,220
just have this as a client-server tool

368
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,520
interface and instead we allow to plug

369
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,880
in all the different things like Python

370
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,770
presented that yesterday that allow

371
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,200
people to work on data analysis on just

372
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,680
browsing Maps doing web GIS or whatever

373
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,600
understands that standards are our

374
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,470
friend so we can attach client a to

375
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,750
server be okay now I've talked too much

376
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,820
so this one I have to shorten

377
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,840
drastically I guess I will just do this

378
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,580
one how many - minutes do I have three

379
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,470
okay so just this one it's embedded into

380
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,940
the earth server initiative which

381
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,600
finances us via the European Commission

382
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,210
and we are we are grateful on that where

383
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,070
we build up databases on three

384
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,800
dimensional image time series and four

385
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,890
dimensional weather data cubes so we

386
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,170
have the Sentinel data of ISA

387
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,570
we have ocean color analysis at Plymouth

388
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,000
Marine Laboratory national computational

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
infrastructure Australia European Centre

390
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,930
for medium-range weather forecast gives

391
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,600
us four dimensional data cubes and then

392
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,390
we do a join a combination of data cubes

393
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,070
between Australia and London reading to

394
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,710
be exact and combine them visualize them

395
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,170
in NASA web world wind so in the end

396
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,670
what we are aiming at is a global

397
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,030
Federation where you can do anything on

398
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,300
the data cubes that are stored here and

399
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,440
there if you want offline I can show you

400
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,940
the demo we don't have time for that

401
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,769
no but I can show you that data fusion

402
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:15,809
already in a first version let us say

403
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,230
okay I had wanted to talk more about OS

404
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,909
q as well because this I thought might

405
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,610
be a good forum for discussion but we

406
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,940
don't have time for that so I will skip

407
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,429
all that and just stop here I guess one

408
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:38,860
minute should I talk even faster we can

409
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,529
pick up by by frequency I guess it

410
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:45,940
doesn't make so much sense but just to

411
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,870
stimulate discussion I cannot resist

412
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,120
totally so what I show you is just the

413
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,759
summary thing here all those things I

414
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,610
wanted to discuss I mentioned our

415
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,580
incubation in OS geo and actually we

416
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,210
were good friends except for one thing

417
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,409
the maintenance of the code where as I

418
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,389
say all software should be free and I

419
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,809
say why we have that doesn't want to

420
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,539
come okay come on come on come on

421
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:27,789
hey don't try to outsmart me got it

422
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,320
okay and yes I admit we have a mixed

423
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,360
license model do a license model it's

424
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,490
that bad I mean we have a full spectrum

425
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,159
we have the full commercial stuff s3 as

426
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,590
a placeholder and then on the other hand

427
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,210
this is what OS geo wants what about

428
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,490
these ones they should be accommodated

429
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,440
as well how much more powerful with OS

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,169
gob if it would be inclusive and get all

431
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,179
that in there terenia is one of the

432
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,639
proponents of such thinking but it

433
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,309
doesn't somehow get through and in the

434
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:00,460
end the s risks don't care about our war

435
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,559
between here and there but the small

436
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,750
companies they suffer is that really

437
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,210
what we want question mark and with that

438
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,419
one I guess I really need to stop thank

439
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:15,179
you on and thank you for very little

440
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,860
so yes suddenly I have five minutes

441
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,730
again that is you have five minutes so

442
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,790
please flames on or comments or whatever

443
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:51,890
okay good so thanks again and bye now

444
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,750
how do I get out without this thing

445
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,260
hanging up a vet should work it doesn't

446
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,600
like to unplug when Windows is in full

447
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,720
screen mode so I need to be careful but

448
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:11,120
it works I don't you do it I'm here now

449
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,000
we just don't know the rest of the

450
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,120
records okay
