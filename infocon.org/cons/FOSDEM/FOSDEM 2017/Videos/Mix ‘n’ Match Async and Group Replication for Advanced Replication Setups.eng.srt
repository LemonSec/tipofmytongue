1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,639
and I'm presenting here basically some

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,830
bases of publication and some mixes that

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,619
you can do with other replication setups

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,810
basically and some migrations that you

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,390
that you need or you want to do how to

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,900
do it how to do them so mix and match

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,119
the synchronous and replication for

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,870
advances of replication setups so yeah

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,940
you can trust me you can and honestly

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm talking about migrations and stuff

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,850
but I'm not an EVM developers so sorry

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,390
makes a mistake support people don't

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,809
kill me please

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,120
so basically I'll start with some

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,690
background on replication replication

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,309
and then some mix setups and now to do

17
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,268
some migrations

18
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,340
and starting from the very basic in the

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,750
beginning there was a synchronous

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,939
replication so everyone knows this right

21
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,369
you have a master you write to the

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,549
master and master generates events that

23
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,000
go to win love advance so two slaves

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,270
slaves are a synchronous and ideally you

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,869
want slaves to make up your data or to

26
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,569
scale your ribs so right you go to the

27
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:37,810
master bridge go to the slaves and you

28
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,069
can read stale data on the slaves that's

29
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:48,880
it and then on 5/5 it was introduced

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
sales synchronous replication so

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
basically it's the same setup you write

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,619
to the mastery from the slaves the

33
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,720
difference is that when you write to the

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,619
master you can wait for the slaves to

35
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,369
acknowledge me so I believe the master

36
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,699
will only come in if some of the slaves

37
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,410
or all the slaves you can configure it

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,350
acknowledged that they cute some data or

39
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,720
they committed where they are committing

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,680
the data so still that master slave but

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,630
now when you commit on the master you

42
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,519
know that the data will appear on the

43
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,030
slave

44
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,400
it's a cost that you can choose to add

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,730
on right so your reads will be more

46
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,480
synchronous

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,090
and awesome early v 7g a we had a multi

48
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,190
Sox replication so multi-touch

49
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,870
replication added to the to the slave

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,240
the notion of channel and the channel is

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,640
basically a connection to a master in

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,390
asleep can have several channels so as I

53
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,910
can receive the information for several

54
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,020
masters there is no conflict resolution

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,390
if you use this we assume you know what

56
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,660
you are doing right so firstly you can

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,510
use this for aggregation or backup in

58
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,000
several masses at the same time stuff

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
like that and again right so the master

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
reaches to the slaves so business as

61
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,930
usual and finally we now release HCA

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,819
group replication so under publication

63
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,760
you have notion of multi master even you

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,600
have configuring as a single master with

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,079
with canary masters but basically there

66
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,690
is a group where every transaction that

67
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,030
we use sent to the group is totally

68
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,500
ordered and received for in every server

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
at the same time at the same logical

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,739
time so you can choose to write several

71
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,739
members at the same time and basically

72
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,829
it is a distributed set machine right so

73
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,900
everyone starts at with the same state

74
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,910
everyone receives the same information

75
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,310
so everyone methods does the same

76
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,690
decisions so we we use that like Peter

77
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,880
is talking about specifications vacation

78
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,770
news is that information to know what is

79
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,190
concurrent what is not so ideally you

80
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,640
have conflict resolution on multi master

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,860
to add one primary master

82
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,460
and since like that or a new presenter

83
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,870
publication your publication everywhere

84
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,930
without mighty distributed recovery

85
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,350
conflict detection and group membership

86
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,540
without much spillover and fault

87
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,760
tolerance and you can write everywhere

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,810
and if your primary dies the group

89
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,100
automatically will choose a new primary

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,510
so you have to be concerned with that

91
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,560
and it's a note suddenly die it is

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,630
kicked out of the group so you don't

93
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:13,200
have to worry about that as well so this

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,050
is group replication and okay but can I

95
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,160
mix it with the other application

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,210
solutions of course so basic scenarios

97
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,450
so replication is limited to nine

98
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,330
members but maybe you want to spell out

99
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,660
by cooking one hundred slaves you can

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,280
still do it you can have a group with

101
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,460
several masters either it is multi

102
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,290
master or single master it doesn't

103
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,110
matter you can still replicate from the

104
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,470
group and have a synchronous slaves so

105
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,550
you can still out ribs or do backups on

106
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,650
cheaper or wherever you want so

107
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,949
you can read from these slaves and the

108
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,389
group will have automatic failover right

109
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,539
if one of those guys dies the approval

110
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,820
just and become new primary if you have

111
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,320
that configured slaves not so much so if

112
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,150
you are replicating from one of those

113
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,820
masters and your master dies then you

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,120
have to reconfigure just like to connect

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,940
to another master at least now let's see

116
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,479
what the future brings also on this

117
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,070
field and you can also do some stuff

118
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,139
like that aggregation from different

119
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,840
groups no one stops you from having a

120
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,740
multi social application from different

121
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,130
groups so you basically have an external

122
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,350
slave that will be configured to have

123
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,870
two channels and replicate from two

124
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,470
groups and again you can use the DS for

125
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,030
that aggregation

126
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,950
to do some backup on she part where

127
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,820
stuff like that

128
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,790
Marvin setups include this that is a

129
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,730
common use case that we see and you have

130
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,660
[Music]

131
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,530
multiple data centers or regions and

132
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,610
basically you have active groups on each

133
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,680
data center but you still want to

134
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,670
replicate from one group to the other as

135
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,590
Peter said it's not optimized yeah but

136
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,720
you can group that sponge we move to

137
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,320
data centers but we don't advise it

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,500
because it's not optimized yet but you

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,140
can still replicate from one data center

140
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,140
to the other in a similar matter manner

141
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,430
so you just connect one master from one

142
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,860
data center to another and vice versa

143
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,030
you can use one pair of masters I use

144
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,400
two pairs here because if one of the

145
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,470
master dies then only one of the

146
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,300
the directions or presentation means

147
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,360
that we other is still working and it's

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,030
still a synchronous replication but if

149
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,290
you have different four o'clock

150
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,450
workloads or different users in

151
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,950
different data centers maybe you don't

152
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,630
care that much in that you like maybe

153
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,229
you can you can still control and four

154
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,000
scenarios maybe you have another snare

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,850
or two to the team and ask us we ever

156
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,160
thought of them or if we advised them

157
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,080
more are against them and now about

158
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,650
migrations so the simplest case right I

159
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,640
have a master slave setup how do I go to

160
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,710
multi master if I want to

161
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,410
so here what I did is that I have a

162
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,160
multi master I have a multi I am a

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,829
master slave set up with rights to the

164
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:19,769
master rich to the same and I choose to

165
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,399
add a new member that is a slave to m1

166
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,759
and I start a group on it I could also

167
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,149
do this taking picking up a slave and

168
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,069
starting for publication in the slave it

169
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,970
will be identical but maybe you don't

170
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,790
want that because to not disrupt the

171
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,470
current set up so you can have a new

172
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,110
member such group application on it

173
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,060
start replicating and when I'm to catch

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,439
up to an one we can start migrating

175
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,139
other slaves to the group and in a sense

176
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,250
the group is also slightly in itself so

177
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,899
sm2 is replicating from m1 it's

178
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,620
disseminating the text to the group so

179
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,519
as to is also a slave in the group so

180
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,850
you can start migrating reached to

181
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,260
and basically you also migrate another

182
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,930
served another slave and then you have

183
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,810
this point here where basically when you

184
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,380
see that the group gets up to m1 you get

185
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,560
rich from you've got two right so m1 you

186
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,540
wait for those rights to be replicate -

187
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,820
M - and then you just migrate the rights

188
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,020
when you have a server that you can also

189
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,450
add to the group and it's there so now

190
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,330
you have a group and you can still use

191
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,210
it in master/slave mode right if you use

192
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,000
primary the primary configuration with

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,220
Canaries or you can have a multi master

194
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:05,490
group another use case stranger use days

195
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,100
but still interesting is I have

196
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,450
different applications in different

197
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,550
servers maybe I want to make it

198
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,380
different shards and I want to aggregate

199
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,350
the data or maybe it's several

200
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,260
applications that I want to make a chain

201
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,900
but I don't want to spend that many

202
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,840
servers on it so we'll just add these

203
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,210
publications to the same group or

204
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,450
something like that

205
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,320
so how do I do this basically you start

206
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,850
replicating from m1 into m2 and the

207
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,950
arctic asian still will run right and -

208
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,440
we'll have to deal with plate from m1

209
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,020
also with the

210
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,840
with it's over all right so maybe that

211
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,730
factor of decision between M 1 and M 2

212
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,890
and basically you start the group on

213
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,630
them - we add a new server here that

214
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,810
maybe people don't want to but for two

215
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,830
reasons first form so a group of two is

216
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,590
all always dangerous because of big

217
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,940
brains but also because there is a point

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,240
in time where you will have to cut the

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,090
rights to m1 and at a point in time if

220
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,010
you are at the question right - m1 in

221
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,440
application writing to M 2 at the point

222
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
in time if you had only one server then

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,670
one server would have to serve two

224
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,830
applications so maybe you don't want

225
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,170
that oh I had entry to the group as well

226
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,550
and three will catch 22 and now you

227
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,430
migrate the rights to to the group so

228
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,350
I'm - it's supposed to have all the

229
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,440
information from my one so you do you

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,330
take the rights from my money and you

231
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,810
put it on M 2 and then you put the can

232
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:07,490
also write to 23 right and you join back

233
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,420
M 1 maybe you want to do some provision

234
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,020
of the data because then - as all the

235
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,540
data that m1 s but then one is lacking

236
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,480
all the data

237
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,090
and to write so maybe you want to do

238
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,190
some provision first for man one and

239
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,730
basically you have it back to the group

240
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,940
now we want so either

241
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,100
several applications in a group with

242
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,350
automatic failover or you have now a

243
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:43,620
sharp - sharks that are now one and and

244
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,190
you can also be do this in another way

245
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,680
you can leverage the multi-source

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,560
replication adjusted to aggregation with

247
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,590
a slave start the group on the slaves

248
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,520
and m2 tool to that group and then do

249
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,260
the same thing

250
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,260
so basically when SNM to catch up to the

251
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,530
load on m1 so SNM to also add the data

252
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,320
from m1 you can migrate to rise from m1

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,870
to to the group and now you also have a

254
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,820
group with new members with all the data

255
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:22,290
from m1 and m2 so maybe you try to

256
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,530
repetition imports not for you anyone to

257
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,350
migrate back this is a simple scenario

258
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,380
but still one that muscle so basically

259
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,290
the groups may be its primary master or

260
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,840
multi master doesn't matter what you

261
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,600
have to do is just you stop your

262
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,780
application in one member you configure

263
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,720
it to be a slave of m1 so we still that

264
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,380
the right from m1 you go to member to

265
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,870
with soccer publication you may keep the

266
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,210
slave of m1 you know you have master

267
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,990
slave right and basically you rip to the

268
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,210
slaves right to the master business as

269
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,630
usual

270
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,970
and if I'm finished early but let's see

271
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,269
[Music]

272
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,089
we've built your publication based on

273
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,360
many of the technologies that we are AVF

274
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,190
so yes we have good communication

275
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,649
perform for example recovery on group

276
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,690
replication is based on masters type is

277
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,639
basically a channel that is creative and

278
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,149
so you can join many of these things you

279
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,220
can do whatever you want you can do have

280
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,610
slaves into groups groups grouped into

281
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,290
slaves

282
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:51,779
multi-source see see me think is well we

283
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,899
don't know how see you sequel comes into

284
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,350
this picture but you can try it or not I

285
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,389
don't know if we advise that maybe we

286
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,329
don't advise that but maybe we'll try

287
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,440
that in the future so basically we are

288
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,779
GF so you can download our packages from

289
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,540
the website documentation is also there

290
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,050
maybe we are improving it and there is

291
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,779
our plots on Mexico I availability

292
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,269
dot-com with all the new stuff that we

293
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,750
are developing so yeah we have a long

294
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,310
path to to go so here is my talking that

295
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,829
Fred oh whoops and I'm on Twitter I

296
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:40,620
don't put that much you can reach me

297
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,150
there I I will respond to you I guess

298
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:49,360
and thank you if you have any questions

299
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,509
yes I believe so

300
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:03,530
what's it

301
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,900
for example master said Toto

302
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,290
multi-master why do you why do you have

303
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,680
to

304
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,230
oh yeah not migrations yeah

305
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,550
yes because you never you never mess

306
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,720
with a with a with a master right yes

307
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,360
there there can be some seconds of some

308
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,360
time here so but

309
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,390
yeah that second so yes you have to be

310
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,110
careful here basically here you have to

311
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,650
wait for a moment where your group is

312
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,600
really really close to mas when the

313
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,250
group is really really close to master

314
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,290
then you have seconds of thumb time

315
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,050
maybe yeah

316
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,389
yeah

317
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,870
yeah

318
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,520
yes because the the member did not fail

319
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,649
the members shoes to him when the

320
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,080
members choose to live there is no

321
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,700
sweeper in Scenario because the group

322
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,659
knows that he left

323
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,820
yes

324
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,550
yes

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,220
no much bitter or talking about that

326
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,750
earlier so if you have a group maybe you

327
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,550
have two members in one data center in

328
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,710
another member in the other these two

329
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,220
guys can when you write to these guys

330
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,530
these guys has performed so they don't

331
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,540
need weight to this guy but eventually

332
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,350
the member the the group has to come I

333
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,770
can only send that much messages until

334
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,290
we test to catch up with this guy here

335
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,710
this guy here eventually will be a

336
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,380
source of contention so that's the thing

337
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,460
we have to improve in the future

338
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,510
if you'll say I'm not available we are

339
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,840
improving that there Kenny as the

340
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,880
problems as some issues with that

341
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,080
because nowadays we we blocked basically

342
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:46,880
so sorry like like instead of having two

343
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,910
pairs you as this guy also connects to

344
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,300
another in another and yes you yeah only

345
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:03,710
one way yes you can connect all the

346
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,480
Masters for all the master basically

347
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,860
with masters thing you can do that

348
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,080
because then the GTI mechanism will skip

349
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,100
all redundancy yeah you can do it you

350
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,540
can connect to more than one masters

351
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,460
can this

352
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,889
doesn't have to be

353
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,650
Oh

354
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,210
yes

355
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,700
yeah

356
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,980
these are different groups each one has

357
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,899
that's all

358
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,999
[Applause]
