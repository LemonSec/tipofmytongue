1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,780
they got the invoice

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,290
today there's a bunch of yeah it's a

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,110
bunch of you for at least so that I

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,050
suppose speech recognition so when I

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,940
started preparing my talking for FOSDEM

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,470
I was thinking about building something

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,930
that was not usual like we usually work

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,880
using various API it was the time our

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,860
commercial stuff like IBM Watson and

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,290
Google Voice and things like that and I

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,299
decided what if I start my talk by

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,980
building an application that space only

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,289
on open source technology including the

14
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:37,910
more advanced stuff such as machine

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,490
learning and stuff like that so what my

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,800
first my name is Lou Caputo era and then

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
you lead that motor lingo which is a

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,620
company that's been managing the Edition

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,140
project in the other stuff and

20
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,610
nomination contributor and it will tell

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,710
you all about tradition today and I've

22
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,329
been playing with fun since I was 8 my

23
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,100
father is also tied for the engineer and

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,790
the Manson Family so demo first

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,040
right someone cool someone call james

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,750
bode well i pull up the demo please so

27
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,729
the demo doesn't actually work so what

28
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,310
i've been trying to do here is get a

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,760
call into a web RTC client which was the

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,080
part that didn't work essentially which

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,090
are attached to my presentation editor

32
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,909
slide on this after and get the call

33
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,159
through speech recognition using pockets

34
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,140
things so it's free and open source

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,040
software running through free platform

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,159
this called NLU that does the actual bot

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,140
interpretation kind of like Tweety are

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,119
there stuff and then spit out the result

39
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,380
what I did here

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,630
I need a Chinese restaurant

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm just piping the events a browser and

42
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,890
essentially what we're doing is that we

43
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,710
get a Chinese restaurant out of that

44
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,380
this is looks simple it is sounds really

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,330
simple it's also very not polished it's

46
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,580
horribly complicated so what just

47
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,150
happened

48
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,030
this was Weber to see going to frizz

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,030
which check the disclaimer so demo might

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,910
not actually contain web word you see

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,150
fredwich

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,040
first which is sending call to audition

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,680
for control a darshan is using the

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,560
result from CMU sphinx to go through

55
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,870
razor ilu and ask Google for a

56
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,000
restaurant a flight is what is speaking

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
the voice a flight is open-source

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,320
TTS engines that's not too bad actually

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,970
that's one of the things I've found out

60
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,710
by building this application is that all

61
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,320
of these products are surprisingly good

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,510
and we're skipping over and giving money

63
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,810
and time to big corporations and we

64
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,640
should probably working with some of

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,470
these people in projects that's for the

66
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,850
important message I got from building

67
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,400
this one well in we're using HTTP just

68
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,770
to go through and this camera says no

69
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,090
keyboards have been harmed during the

70
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,470
preparation of this demo that's not

71
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,760
actually true I broke one just because

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,870
it was so angry so moving part as I said

73
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,040
is we have frizz which I with mod Verto

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Edition which is the main control layer

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,989
pocket Sphinx and half-light are deep

76
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,930
voice and raised I believe so what you

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,459
everybody knows with frizz which is by

78
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,930
now there's been like three

79
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,489
presentations and Giovanni is better

80
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,780
than me and explaining with frizz which

81
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,510
is so it's a switching platform you can

82
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,070
use it for a variety of things it's good

83
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,019
it's got very good modularity it's easy

84
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,300
to turn off features you don't want and

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,720
it's got very good WebRTC support to mod

86
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,180
Verto I'm talking about frizz which just

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,769
because I use frizz which to build this

88
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:34,760
particular demo

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,590
Aster's will be asked they don't have

90
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,540
mod virtu they just use it over a web

91
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,410
RTC and it's pretty much there right now

92
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,420
their feature equal depending exactly

93
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,590
what you need there might be some

94
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,239
differences but I don't see anything

95
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,450
that's really relevant than that

96
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,550
hearing voices that are pockets banks

97
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,500
that cook participants will be tuned for

98
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,180
better results for starters this guy

99
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,370
really only understands a few hundred

100
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,840
words just because I'm running with the

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
stock grammar just a larger grammar I

102
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,740
didn't have time to install that it

103
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,210
sounds like it's worked pretty well

104
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,820
and a flight used to gives you good TTS

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,070
for the price which is free the voice is

106
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,960
a bit robotic but then again it does

107
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,660
speak pretty well the interesting thing

108
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,100
I discovered when working on this

109
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,839
project was this library I didn't know

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,570
about which is razza NLU this is a

111
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,620
machine learning and natural language

112
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,990
processing library that aims at

113
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,510
providing a service similar to we say I

114
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,600
Lewis API dot AI so essentially a

115
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,750
conversational interpretation of text

116
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,360
you ask it a question and you on the

117
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,740
back end you have built a tree of

118
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,650
entities and phrases it understands and

119
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,660
it will give you back an intent and

120
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,530
subjects

121
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,090
what's an intent intent is what the

122
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,460
person wanted to do or know and what the

123
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,680
subject is is what the person wanted to

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,660
do or know about so I need the Chinese

125
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,090
restaurant as an intent of restaurant

126
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,730
search in my computer example and an

127
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,130
object of Chinese because I said I want

128
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,080
the Chinese restaurant so that's then

129
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,210
used to do a search this is a very very

130
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,680
interesting project also because it's

131
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,320
almost batteries included it's we didn't

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,950
take long to set up and the time you're

133
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,500
taking and setting up your model can be

134
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,030
reused on any other platform just

135
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,390
because they're compatible so building

136
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,190
yeah principally one thing we need a

137
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,810
better way to set up Friz virtual

138
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,920
rafters so remember to see the

139
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,280
development locally working with various

140
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,290
security requirements especially the SSL

141
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,360
Certificates it's a pain that needs to

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,010
be fixed and I'm probably gonna start

143
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,110
and figure out how to fix it from Monday

144
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,110
on pocket Sphinx is not as bad as the

145
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,760
reputation it has pockets fiends is

146
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,160
considered a toy that is a wrong

147
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,550
essentially brung it does most of what

148
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,720
you need in a simple application

149
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,700
including interpreting simple grammars

150
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,610
so you can ask yes/no questions you're

151
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,080
generally asking that kind of question

152
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,820
in a voice application anyway you don't

153
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,800
want people to tell you the story of

154
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,750
their lives and then interpret that you

155
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,190
don't really care if they need a

156
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,090
counselor they call a person not a bot

157
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,070
there's value in running your own brain

158
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,280
like of course there's an economical

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,230
value you're not spending money at all

160
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,730
and essentially the set-up time is so

161
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,500
tiny it's probably worth to still look

162
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,750
into using something that you host

163
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,820
personally and you're contributing back

164
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,639
to open source and you're not giving

165
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,260
things back to you Facebook or Google or

166
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,880
whatever they have enough money didn't

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,660
read ours a very important part it's

168
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,000
addition itself so all these services

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,100
are disconnected in a sense from each

170
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,360
other phrase which records the audio

171
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,380
pockets phynx interprets it and all you

172
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,720
gives you the conversational

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,370
representation of what the person said

174
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,169
but you need something to run the call

175
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,800
pick up answer do the recordings shuttle

176
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,510
around messages between the various

177
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,550
parts and that's where Edition comes

178
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,580
into place so first of all as anybody

179
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,540
here heard about tradition before that's

180
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,440
like 300 percent the usual amount which

181
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,110
is one it's great it's a ruby voice

182
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,630
application framework which provides

183
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,090
three third-party code control logic to

184
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,620
toy phone engines which means we don't

185
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,350
mess with the actual media flow we just

186
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,140
handle things like picking up the call

187
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,380
transferring answering recording playing

188
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,510
audio collecting input using ASR etc it

189
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,610
connects to the two main open-source

190
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,960
platforms which are first which an

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,060
asterisk using two different mechanisms

192
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,550
one is Rio for a phrase which and one is

193
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,100
am i for asterisk we're not on a or I I

194
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,340
know we should version su is stable in

195
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,630
it's been stable for a while too we just

196
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,479
released a an update and version three

197
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,820
has been it RC one for quite a while

198
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,220
because there's one Bachman it to fix

199
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,560
and we we need we need a sponsor for

200
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,940
that essentially but we've come back

201
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,430
come up soon enough and it's backed by a

202
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,500
foundation so the project has guaranteed

203
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,120
long-term viability and so we have a few

204
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,770
new things in addition three which make

205
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,440
it even easier to build that you use as

206
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,680
a glue for building your own complicated

207
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,200
applications whether the voice based or

208
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,139
other types further support Israel

209
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,030
that's mmm he doesn't use the Yemen

210
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,770
socket anymore in case anybody knows

211
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,870
what nerve and sock it is after saliva

212
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,539
no class is required which is well mmm I

213
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,330
mean right now it's okay I think we

214
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,189
streamlines the internals a lot its

215
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,440
godlike to Reaper it's 30% faster in

216
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,380
benchmarks and it's got a built in HTTP

217
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,969
server so if you need to build a very

218
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,529
simple dashboard to your example PBX the

219
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,240
lab for me internal telephony exchange

220
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,220
for your office you can have it straight

221
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,500
on this server without any other service

222
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,750
and it's got native internalization

223
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,110
support which means you can easily play

224
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,279
and send translated text it's important

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,660
just because we didn't have it I know I

226
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,029
know it's forgiving this days but it

227
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,730
wasn't there before what can you do so

228
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,399
there is plugins plugins TV voice mail

229
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,370
zero TTS what's in the TTS that's a

230
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,829
plugin I built that will play dates

231
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:17,260
numbers and generally ordinal numbers so

232
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,420
for second turn just starting from a

233
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,880
string with audio files it carries

234
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,649
itself so you can even run without any

235
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:25,540
kind of TTS and it will still try and

236
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,480
play audio for people there's platform

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
specific function right up against

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,839
mostly for asterisk asterisk sprited

239
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,420
support native support well first which

240
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,000
is only supported through Rio

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,649
we are clustering logging has been

242
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,449
unified so it's easier to deploy to

243
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,399
Heroku and whatnot they're all small

244
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,949
changes by far and wide but generally

245
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:49,899
speaking means that you can just take an

246
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,230
edition of the Kishin deploy to Heroku

247
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,490
pointed at your fridge which server and

248
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,240
you're done so every phone call is an

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,850
actor probably someone assert about the

250
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,949
actor model some people haven't as

251
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,940
anybody here used or Lang or Alec sir

252
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,370
same people from before anyway the idea

253
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,079
is that every call is isolated you for

254
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,850
call crashes the process doesn't go down

255
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,699
so we're falling back into Joanna

256
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,589
mentioned earlier so if if a call goes

257
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,000
down it's not a big deal someone guess

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,339
your system doesn't go down so the goal

259
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,260
is to have something that always runs a

260
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,630
messages are passing around with as

261
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,850
events and each call runs the

262
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,490
the extra thread which is a technical

263
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,250
term to say if the call dies all in the

264
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,940
cold ice rest stays up so a society

265
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,560
controller scooped up fishers so it's

266
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,389
Santa like trails or any MVC application

267
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,370
really there's a controller for every

268
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,220
thing you want people to do so the demo

269
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,829
Iran is one controller tasks the person

270
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,079
for the restaurant checks for the if

271
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,240
there's a valid input and then looks for

272
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,889
a restaurant and sends the URL back to

273
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,310
the browser

274
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,699
Robi kind of like web app controls which

275
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,420
cow call goes to which controller using

276
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,980
I don't know could be a phone number

277
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,259
could be time of the day so the usual

278
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,790
time of the day thing when you're

279
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,170
officer open or closed

280
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,149
but it's far more flexible than using

281
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,889
the dial plan because you can this is a

282
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,899
normal real application you can access

283
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,240
anything you want inside the application

284
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,279
there's an event handler to handle a

285
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,440
sync messages and it generally based on

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,540
satellite which makes it behave similar

287
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,269
to what I can do blank application is

288
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,310
and there are DSL for all common

289
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,569
operations so you can really replace

290
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:34,420
your doubt line quickly on the right

291
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,040
protocol of our protocol is an XMPP

292
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,259
extension that we use to communicate the

293
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,519
phrase which it's interesting because

294
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,290
it's called building load balancing so

295
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,970
it scales easy it scales very well

296
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,709
actually Edition scales better than

297
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,910
first which then Astra's thanks to Rio

298
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,339
as a side effect every Edition node is

299
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,339
also its own XMPP address you can use to

300
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,160
control the instance or send out events

301
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,399
or participate in chats so that's not

302
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,009
really restricted to first which it will

303
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,930
just connect to first which using Rio

304
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,600
but it was also okay eight so edition on

305
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,189
after that's no riot support there's no

306
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,959
rhinoceros doesn't really matter

307
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,180
connects via ami we're not using a RI

308
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,089
yet again sorry we'll get there there's

309
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,610
much better native command support so if

310
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,259
you have a platform that's made in a

311
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,569
very complicated asterisk install with

312
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,759
the giant Dow plan with thousands of

313
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,189
lines and contacts skips and whatnot

314
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,810
you're better served moving it to

315
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,100
additional right now because it will be

316
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,319
at least one tenth of the lines of code

317
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,120
near Ruby it's likely easy to get

318
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,620
started because of configuration a

319
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,240
couple reasons so if you checking out

320
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,970
the do some try Astros first what can

321
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,710
you do

322
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,120
as I said calls conferences media drive

323
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,720
various types of speech recognition

324
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,860
commercial engines that uses special

325
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,890
grammars that are XML formats build very

326
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,320
complex IVRS from simply press one if

327
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
you need to do this or press two to do

328
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,910
that we have IV arts recording anything

329
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,360
from flight reservations to people

330
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,860
placing complaints because they didn't

331
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,470
receive their newspaper today to really

332
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,540
anything else and you can connect to

333
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,090
database deployment is speed up a little

334
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,980
just to get to a few other interesting

335
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,380
slides it's deployed on any really any

336
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,510
ruby flavor it's usually one one with

337
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,040
fries which an asterisk store is

338
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,270
efficient how you can scale so you can

339
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,190
use sort decoupled you can have multiple

340
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,760
nodes with multiple fresh notes it's

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,350
easier to scale provider you have a load

342
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,270
balancer so it makes it everything

343
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,000
easier to scale quickly this is an XML

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,820
diet plan for privilege and this it's

345
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,980
like a board with a nail through it it's

346
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,530
good but there will only be work for

347
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,150
some things and it's difficult to adapt

348
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,560
is not about what we can read it of

349
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,880
course but you can't eat the slides

350
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,740
yeah it's a control car it's not the

351
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,180
serial shorter so it doesn't look like

352
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,040
it's any simpler but keep in mind that

353
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,840
it's normal Ruby code you can literally

354
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,970
access anything a ruby application can

355
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,460
so anything from a common line

356
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,340
application to API as to whatever you

357
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,680
need we use this to push events to the

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,690
browser as you saw was just connecting

359
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,100
to a bap socket and pushing events to

360
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,600
the browser right away without any

361
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,160
intermediate process who's using

362
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,860
addition just to give you a few examples

363
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,230
these guys have an interesting

364
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,260
application based an asterisk if I'm not

365
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,890
wrong that does so Europe you need a

366
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,540
doctor you don't know who to call you're

367
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,280
new in the area they give you a number

368
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,080
you called that number they put you

369
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,420
through doctors are their own call or

370
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,460
available depending on a complex routing

371
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,620
table for example that's the kind of

372
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
application that will be a pain to build

373
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,550
in just in a doubt line or just using

374
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,490
more HTTP curl complicated stuff like

375
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,290
that just because you will have to adapt

376
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,570
your logic to how asterisk and frizz

377
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,060
which want you to build it well here

378
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,280
what you do is just keep your logic in

379
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,120
addition all you

380
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,240
simply asked a simple SQL query

381
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
manipulate whatever you need to do

382
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,170
generate specific messages for the

383
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,420
different doctors and just handle the

384
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,760
call in any easier and more integrated

385
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,500
way again we're not doing anything with

386
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,630
the media flows or signaling or whatnot

387
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,920
this is just call control live connect

388
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,540
this is the newest project we have this

389
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,390
is WebRTC based this is users which the

390
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,089
broadcast operating room surgery why is

391
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,220
this sip based because we got a very

392
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,380
strange piece of hardware that's FDA

393
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,600
approved in the US and we could only use

394
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,100
that and that's a very weird thing

395
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,990
because it connects through sip to send

396
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,900
out video this I don't know who came up

397
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,610
with that we have to use that just

398
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,320
because changing that one and you know

399
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,180
the millions of dollars invested and

400
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,370
what not and so what we do is that

401
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,980
client calls first server and we just

402
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,350
replicate the call over to a web RTC

403
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,900
people that they call him in this case

404
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,570
what the challenge was is managing

405
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,970
security you have to be very sure that

406
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,279
you as a student you're only allowed to

407
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,650
join a certain surgery during a certain

408
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,500
time and not other times just to you

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,740
know you are all sensible data and stuff

410
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,650
so again in this case the darshan allows

411
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,230
you to very easily manage access to the

412
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,640
conferences by going through the

413
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,770
database we actually check with I think

414
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,950
it's say I don't remember which big CRM

415
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,770
application is handling the actual

416
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,900
access but the university that's running

417
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,970
this as their own platform and as part

418
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,589
of checking if the user is allowed to

419
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,300
try to get into a conference we check

420
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,930
with that API

421
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,149
powered on remodeling this is just a big

422
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,149
customer of all things dirt well

423
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,589
Christopher hostas are so big users for

424
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,270
their son they have a very big their

425
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,730
cell half a billion dollars of Windows

426
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,220
every year which is a huge amount of

427
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,529
Windows not Windows computer windows

428
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,830
like literally glass windows they were

429
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,940
built out of a essentially out of

430
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,950
co-signers so the cosigner has always

431
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,370
been very central to their strategy and

432
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,980
I'm talking about them more about the

433
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,439
scaling properties that the darshan has

434
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,329
than the actual functionality in this

435
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,740
particular case addition is not doing

436
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,839
much more than just a dollar so what it

437
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,400
does is they have a list of people they

438
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,199
call those people and connect them to

439
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,089
agents to have them confirm appointments

440
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,579
or take it from it it's very simple from

441
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,800
an operating standpoint but they have

442
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,209
four hundred call center operators

443
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,480
working 24/7 and they have only one

444
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,330
Astra spots and one addition node we do

445
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,120
not are called spare standing by so yeah

446
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,440
that's not me do but they're what

447
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,140
they're doing so the we can run a lot of

448
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,670
calls it doesn't add any noticeable

449
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,980
overhead you're gonna hit your asterisk

450
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,440
or frizz which single box number of

451
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,420
maximum number of calls before you hit

452
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,790
the ruby maximum number of calls in this

453
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,370
case well there's a few other of as I

454
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,490
said the publishing system they do

455
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,800
complaints and stuff we have one MVNO oh

456
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,990
I have yes which one but no one knows

457
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,760
which one it's ring plus in the US just

458
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,890
because there's nobody here from the US

459
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,100
side of things I think and there's an

460
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
interesting free project we have is the

461
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,790
cultural mediator network so people that

462
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,920
speak a language and I've done a course

463
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,290
party got the Italian government say I'm

464
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,120
available I speak Hindi and I'm

465
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,010
available to help out people who are in

466
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,870
distress and only speak that language

467
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,230
and there's a writing system that the

468
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,790
police can call a number and they will

469
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,190
give it will give them a personal

470
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,380
speaking that language so they can put

471
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,120
them in touch with say someone was with

472
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
the police or in hospital and not

473
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,679
speaking our language we have cases

474
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,960
though in which the nurse or postman

475
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,669
didn't know which which language the

476
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,190
person was speaking so in which case we

477
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,390
wrapped them two

478
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,060
some people are speak a lot of languages

479
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,770
and will try to understand what language

480
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,550
that is so thank you I have to speed

481
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,140
through a little there's plenty of other

482
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,000
things they could show you but main

483
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,710
thing it's addition removes a lot of the

484
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,450
complexity of building applications like

485
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,700
the one I sort of demoed earlier and

486
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,260
fortunately we can fix the WebRTC

487
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,210
certificate but that's something I'll

488
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,120
fix later and if there's any questions

489
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,840
I'll be glad to ask you answer I should

490
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,360
be about three minutes yes

491
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,720
great hope you liked it

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,329
[Applause]
