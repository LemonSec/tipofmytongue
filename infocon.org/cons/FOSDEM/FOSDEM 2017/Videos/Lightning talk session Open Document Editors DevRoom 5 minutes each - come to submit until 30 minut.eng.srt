1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,210
hey guys good evening welcome to the

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,859
very last slot in the open document

3
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:16,129
added to staff room happy to have so

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,109
many of you still here it was a great

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,690
day wonderful program here in this room

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,990
so thanks to all the openoffice and

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,110
libreoffice and well to Serie B charger

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,930
guys I'm presenting so let's finish off

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,390
this day with a session of lightning

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,640
talks we got 7 talks recruited here

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,190
perhaps one more if you have the time in

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,640
the end yes the rules everyone got five

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,200
minutes

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,230
I'm having some stopwatch here 30

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,270
seconds before times up I will be

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,899
standing and looking at you and at the

17
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,540
five minute job we will all kind of get

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,090
up and and give you some applause so to

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,980
properly cut you off in a friendly way

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,649
and then the next guy comes up and so

21
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,740
the order is 2 times Markus more heart

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:15,440
then sponsor then Samuel and then I

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,780
forget oh yeah call two times and J

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,860
looks in the end so without further

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:32,810
adieu Marcos Marcos we talk about Marcos

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,700
talk about UI hacks Marcos is one of the

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,100
one of the early contributors to the

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,530
project has been active since I think

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:51,510
March 2011 so hey go Marcus thanks

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,050
so I will talk a bit about UI testing

31
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,800
there was a tenor from TDF about a year

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,860
ago I think about developing a UI

33
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,230
testing framework we have a lot of

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,680
testing frameworks already for normal

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,740
stuff but developing a UI testing

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,350
framework is not that simple there are a

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,410
lot of different approaches but most of

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,960
them have some really really active

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,650
parts I think that the best ones at the

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,720
moment are on the four web stuff but

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,030
yeah I've been thinking about that for

42
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,020
for many years so I've designed one and

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,660
implemented as part of the tender it's

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,440
an own implementation it has two parts

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,580
we have an introspection library in the

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,270
deep office code that provides

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,930
information about our UI elements to the

48
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,920
outside world and allows us to send

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,620
commands to these UI elements so it's a

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,459
short a really really short layer above

51
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,660
our UI elements and this year and then

52
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,870
we connect to that introspection code

53
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,910
with piping code to a you know interface

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,430
really really simply you know interface

55
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,250
so that writing the Python code does not

56
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,540
require any new you know knowledge if

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,910
anyone has ever done some you know

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,910
coding you know that not requiring the

59
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,010
you know is actually a feature not a bug

60
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,860
element discovery so finding a UI

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,350
element and for example a button in a

62
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,250
dialog happens through the IDS that we

63
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,489
have in UI files the advantage of using

64
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,200
the the IDs

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,260
is that they should be stable and that

66
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,530
they are locally unique so if you have a

67
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,700
dialog it should be unique and

68
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,129
if you move for example the button to a

69
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,319
different place in the same dialogue you

70
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,790
should still get the the same button by

71
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,360
going through the idea

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,720
well our Travie API test framework that

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,160
we inherited from openoffice.org suffers

74
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,150
from a lot of sleeps that when and if

75
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,669
the test fails and you notice okay let's

76
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,460
increase the sleep time a bit it does

77
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,070
not fail anymore you realize okay you

78
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,290
don't want to have sleeps and your test

79
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,380
frameworks in UI tests where a lot of

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,770
things happen unpredictably you need a

81
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,870
way to issue a command and wait until

82
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,900
the event has happened for that we sent

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,260
now events for quite a few things and

84
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,020
listen to the events on the testing

85
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,380
framework side and resume our work as

86
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,700
soon as the events are there so what's

87
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,400
good about the framework most of our UI

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,639
elements are already covered so most of

89
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,400
the stuff that you find in a dialog has

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,010
part of this introspection library

91
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,270
support the elements are easily

92
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,030
discoverable by the framework so you can

93
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,270
address them most of them have an ID

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,180
some of them have none yet especially

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,850
the ones that we create and don't load

96
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,810
from UI files that we don't have any

97
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,850
test failures if you just changed the

98
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,479
dialog a bit if our UX guys decide once

99
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,590
again let's redo the dialog as long as

100
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,750
they keep the idea yeah the test will

101
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,610
still work because it's our own code we

102
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,979
can support any feature that we have in

103
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,220
the profits for for users anything as

104
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,400
complex as we want it we can implement

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,789
it on our side and

106
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,330
quite importantly we can place the code

107
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,999
at the correct location so that it's as

108
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,669
close to the code path taken by user

109
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,749
events as possible which also helps in

110
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,520
finding bugs so the bad they are key as

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,650
I mentioned no UI testing framework is

112
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,479
perfect yeah if you want to support a

113
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,180
new UI element like a special type of

114
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,029
button you would need to add some code

115
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,159
to the leap office core to make it

116
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,879
available on the pipe inside because you

117
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,710
have to change leap office you can't

118
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,520
just run the tests against any older

119
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,059
versions the tests are quite slow

120
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,249
loading gear office takes quite some

121
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,039
time waiting until the UI is ready even

122
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,800
more so currently a normal test is

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,610
around 5 seconds and yeah we need to

124
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,969
maintain our own framework which is good

125
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,699
to some degree but also again some work

126
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,870
for us that's it

127
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,810
Cisco is already writing tests so with

128
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,620
that so apparently it works if you want

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,279
to do it

130
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,870
talk to me I will help you

131
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,589
[Applause]

132
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,430
yeah but we don't yeah we don't need

133
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,490
these sleeves that we have so that's why

134
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,530
we have these events so we wait until

135
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:09,340
the event is done so I talked about UI

136
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,120
testing while looking at our manual

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,130
testing which was more or less the

138
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,800
source for all our UI tests in the

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,630
beginning well if we did not have

140
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,300
automatic UI testing framework we used

141
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,590
manual testing for that which looks a

142
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,650
bit like that you have a simple

143
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,450
instruction you repeat that but yeah it

144
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,090
somehow doesn't state how do you do it

145
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,850
in the future if you want to increase

146
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,919
the tests how if you want to do more

147
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,030
tests run it on more platforms do you

148
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,720
want to do that trust more people doing

149
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,970
stupid instructions that were written

150
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,360
down what do you want to actually use

151
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,690
that that scales perfectly like taking

152
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,100
Amazon Cloud you could do as much work

153
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,440
as you want so I've started working on

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,400
that recently the idea comes from the

155
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,970
crash reporting that I wanted to test

156
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,900
and which has some problems that we

157
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,790
can't cover in our current test

158
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,290
framework so these tests run all on

159
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,310
country on release bills and the idea

160
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,980
would be that we start a virtual machine

161
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,500
to whatever we want there we have a

162
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,380
clean state we have can install any

163
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,840
dependency that we want

164
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,140
can test the integration with the system

165
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,200
for example does the installation work

166
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,400
does the connection to another service

167
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
work all the stuff that we currently

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,170
can't do in our test because it either

169
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,810
requires to change the system or because

170
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,000
it requires some dependencies that we

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,260
can't assume in our tests our repository

172
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,460
some tests already for the crash

173
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,660
reporting I've some ideas how to do it a

174
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,840
bit better with the VMS there's some

175
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Python frameworks that you can use and I

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,220
want to do that for a number of things

177
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,770
that we currently have in the manual

178
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,570
test that we can't cover with the UI

179
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,500
tests but taking the UI test into these

180
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,290
tests allow us to Tomales to whatever

181
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,030
a user does even if it requires change

182
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,780
in the system I think that's all

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,390
[Applause]

184
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,019
[Applause]

185
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:26,009
test test can you hear me simply stop hi

186
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:30,930
I want to talk about changes and I hope

187
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,110
that in a few years we can use it

188
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,550
different David Bowie song may be heroes

189
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,250
so hopefully we can do this way so I

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,709
want to talk about ODF so what is from

191
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,920
one side ODF is just the state of the

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,290
users work right it's can be used by but

193
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,810
it's used by LibreOffice it was the

194
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,759
right from star fees so it's very

195
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,949
typical to libreoffice maybe that's one

196
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,720
of the reasons that Libre is so dominant

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,199
here in the ODF editor def room right

198
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,470
and it consists like we heard before

199
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,589
about XML so and images is quite open

200
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,230
but there's a different angle

201
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,360
ODF is also a blueprint it's an

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,250
interface between different applications

203
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,269
right so that's very important here it

204
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,060
is specified by Oasis for companies and

205
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,850
people like me are might join and soup

206
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,870
loo print that others use this to use

207
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,459
the data and give it to someone else

208
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:30,149
like once on floppy disk and also very

209
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,949
important it's an ISO standard there are

210
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,930
many standards but the ISIS then that is

211
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,360
very important because this is only be

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,029
done by countries like Dean in Germany

213
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,360
and also very important the country like

214
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,480
Great Britain Netherlands did can say we

215
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,360
have to or we we demand that this file

216
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,279
format is being used and this is very

217
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,010
very important because some you might

218
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,050
there's the biggest impact that only

219
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,540
have had was on Microsoft Microsoft

220
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,060
created in a very very small amount of

221
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,620
time the oxm L standard and it's not

222
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
even the name maybe you know it was

223
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,480
confusing me a lot in the beginning the

224
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,970
first version of open document format

225
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,130
was called OpenOffice 6 ml but then was

226
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,839
changed because what too specific to one

227
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,070
application so it

228
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,139
go to a standard we want to use a more

229
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,839
generic name so others people can join

230
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,500
yes

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,990
so it's called was this name was dropped

232
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,050
office open and office open XML was born

233
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,880
by just switching the words I find it

234
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,630
very interesting that they didn't it the

235
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,269
the most in part is why did they do this

236
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,120
I mean why did they invest it so much

237
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,370
money into creating their own iso

238
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,610
standard and to be honest I'm not sure

239
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,620
but it has to do with the ISO standard

240
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,410
that governments can demand that the

241
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,110
companies have to fulfill the standard

242
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,850
and I believe that what we heard that

243
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,829
it's like a domino chain but this time

244
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,480
it started when the biggest player the

245
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,720
government's going to be like SP and

246
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,060
Oracle were large companies that supply

247
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,949
this far from it so there's a lot lot

248
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,050
power in this and I guess this is all

249
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,980
quite often forgotten here that when I

250
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,660
talk on the table and I want to sound

251
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,089
like my software and I care about

252
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,160
I'd say Libre Office and I can't sell

253
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,750
audio if I don't care about audio yes

254
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,970
this is very powerful I cannot explain

255
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,459
how a powerful and cannot estimate it

256
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:27,360
but they they did it once and I believe

257
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,680
there's a reason that they have to do it

258
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,350
again and there's a maybe a leverage how

259
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,880
to how to break the monopoly on the

260
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,100
business market so first what are the up

261
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,480
stockists that we do currently have

262
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,870
there some of them so first of all

263
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,300
collaboration it's not good enough to

264
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,920
send documents around this times are

265
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,990
over like nowadays we are all have

266
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,350
smartphones we are all connected and so

267
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,440
sending this documents around is it's

268
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,670
not good enough because you don't know

269
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,050
what the others has changed you want to

270
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,149
merge easily and we do it for software

271
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,889
all the develops know we have source

272
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,990
control system for the files and you can

273
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,790
do merges there and we having a way to

274
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,639
say like and like and get for source

275
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,130
code what does the was it diff and this

276
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,860
should be defined by changes the next

277
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,259
time there's no runtime api like HTML

278
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,620
head with the Dom this is very important

279
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,209
for third parties of then there's one of

280
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,220
the biggest obstacle for for selling and

281
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,199
last time there's no feature testing

282
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
testing if I want to buy me a machine

283
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
then I took like a test and what's the

284
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,660
feature the pair's them

285
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,170
comparison and nowadays I see

286
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,330
applications that they say on we support

287
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,310
ODF but when I test a few documents I

288
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,530
realize they're very lousy and there

289
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,270
should be better testing and this is not

290
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,100
possible yet you can only load save and

291
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,110
test but if we would have something like

292
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,970
a feature testing then we but very

293
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,340
powerful so how we do it as I said with

294
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,980
changes the documents are too large and

295
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,470
what we're doing we are not we're going

296
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,090
on higher level and we say something

297
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,710
like I've changed the one millionth

298
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,070
paragraph - Rhett that's what I did and

299
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,880
we we abstract from the details like XML

300
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,640
we go to what the news knows by this we

301
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,820
can go across as many applications as

302
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,790
possible and of course I talked about

303
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,770
this little earlier we have to refer to

304
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,170
a cert version that's develops no they

305
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,090
use hash but I'm not again on XML

306
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,800
because the verbose we use it on this

307
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,410
logical box so what's in ours do we have

308
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,380
in mind it's as I said I can do like in

309
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,660
github I clone the document of this

310
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,430
read-only document I said oh by the way

311
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,010
there's a typo I do like you fix it I

312
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,130
only sent this small change or if you

313
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,200
say have a contract and then you return

314
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
only the change not the full contract

315
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,910
with some kind of hidden changes are not

316
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,250
aware of you can exchange no longer only

317
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,440
documents but changes this is very

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,930
powerful and also a versioning system

319
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,000
like give me all the changes since I

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,700
modification and also powerful you can

321
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,980
sign the document this is basically of

322
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,800
XML not the zip and this signed document

323
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,260
can be documented and changed by

324
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,780
changing side and still yes the signed

325
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,089
document so you can do a ping pong of

326
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,189
documents with with signing which is

327
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:12,630
currently not possible on there lot of

328
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,609
other features and I want to tell you

329
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,650
that this should be our future and you

330
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,869
shouldn't get this either standard

331
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,849
opportunity out of him and that's it

332
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,560
Thanks

333
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,379
[Applause]

334
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,960
so next one has some kind of I think I'm

335
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,999
gonna share that with Simon Beaufoy

336
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:56,149
Samuel another one of the early liberal

337
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:59,679
office contributors I think June 2011

338
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,289
was your first right so so this is about

339
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,409
something that we just started to do the

340
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,599
project's called GPG for libera it's

341
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,169
about integrating the new privacy guard

342
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,499
into Libre Office is this is all about

343
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,440
document signing and document encryption

344
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,869
based on public key cryptography using

345
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,039
lots of cool stuff that's already out

346
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,389
down the project is funded by the German

347
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:35,169
federal agency for information security

348
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,989
they do all kinds of things like audits

349
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,960
like security recommendations but they

350
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,549
also look into how to strategically

351
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,440
change the software landscape to make

352
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,379
everybody more secure and this is one of

353
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:58,460
that so conceptually it's about using

354
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,759
the new GPG can improve see guard and

355
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,479
another set of axillary tools that are

356
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,649
there like key management and

357
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,799
integration for example into Windows and

358
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,059
there's a noise API wrapper for that GP

359
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,359
g m-e and that goes by IPC to our

360
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,169
process tools and kind of offload all

361
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,109
the security relevant stuff to those

362
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,450
tools so liberals doesn't really have to

363
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,659
bother with keeping the the the

364
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,029
passphrase secure and not just growing

365
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,059
up bethey with the algorithms so and in

366
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,979
the end what should much would happen is

367
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,649
that liberal office is able to sign

368
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,039
documents and also encrypt documents

369
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,429
worth so signed documents with your

370
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:52,299
private key and encrypt documents for

371
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,099
recipients that you have the public key

372
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,649
for so you find it on a key server and

373
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:57,890
your

374
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,660
able to encrypt a document for that

375
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,770
recipient the advantage to the

376
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,160
established x51 certificates is that

377
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,230
it's much better for decentralized

378
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,030
organizations because you always have

379
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,190
the problem if you're not a single

380
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,350
company how to distribute the keys

381
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,650
without trusting an external source like

382
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,710
a CA for that so want to take over from

383
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,910
here can do but I don't know what I'm

384
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:38,450
expecting yeah screenshots yeah the

385
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,430
first steps we did was to make it more

386
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,380
[Music]

387
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,790
they say and when the document

388
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,340
encryption is broken the signature the

389
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,360
current signature there was an dialog

390
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,770
shown earlier which not even had a

391
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,220
warning box or something so no I can

392
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,640
just wall of text and you could easily

393
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,030
easily ignore it so the first thing we

394
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,390
did put an info bar right info bar when

395
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,600
the signature is broken and orange one

396
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,610
when it has issues like an untrusted

397
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,070
certificate or earlier Open Office

398
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,610
versions and signed only parts of the

399
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:34,480
document yeah and the next steps are

400
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,550
yeah we are currently integrating GPG

401
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,640
for me into libreoffice to build it and

402
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,890
there is a small wrapper for c++ which

403
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,090
makes it even easier to use will be also

404
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,340
integrating that yes I think that's

405
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,220
called clearly for me plus plus or

406
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,040
something yeah and then we're going to

407
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,670
make the your own certificates your own

408
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,950
keys visible in the digital signatures

409
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,770
dialog so you can use the existing

410
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,280
dialog to sign with typically and later

411
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,309
on awesome

412
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:17,909
tripped yeah and there's all sort of

413
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:20,610
wonderful follow-up projects there so

414
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,499
including PDF signing and and stuff like

415
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:27,960
for for documents so for PDF there's a

416
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,940
nice feature that you when you sign a

417
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,179
PDF then there's a little area where you

418
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,039
can put some some flex Emily off of

419
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,799
yours actual signature there that then

420
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,450
gets integrated to the document and

421
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,100
something that's like that we really

422
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,369
nice to have for EF as well it needs a

423
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,749
little bit of its need some kind of

424
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:50,369
field special purpose field them to to

425
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,159
contain that and um so for this

426
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,619
signature stuff I think that should be

427
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:58,309
covered by the existing or EFS back I

428
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,320
think for encryption we will probably

429
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,889
have to propose something to the OT FTC

430
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:10,470
but it's the second step okay so that's

431
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,360
about it it's broadly an announcement

432
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,799
that we started working on that so then

433
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,749
this is the first step spam any

434
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:35,159
questions yeah they will be stacked on

435
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,309
each other so they all will be shown so

436
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:39,929
you can you can have a full screen of

437
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,710
info boss

438
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,569
[Music]

439
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:02,130
yeah pretty much I mean there's already

440
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,440
pretty nice PDF signing but it's still

441
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,299
using I mean it's it's again using this

442
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,860
x5 4-1 keys and it will be great do that

443
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,419
with GPG keys as well I've no idea it

444
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,429
might be completely unfeasible but it

445
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,350
would be nice no I still I haven't

446
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,840
looked into the into the PDF spec but

447
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,179
we're running out of time so I guys um

448
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:28,970
next one up is I think you core

449
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,560
[Applause]

450
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,529
yeah so I'm course gonna talk a little

451
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:00,409
bit about it cause here since forever

452
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,059
cause one of the founders of the

453
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,190
document foundation has been active in

454
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,679
the Open Office or project since I don't

455
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,889
know two thousand two three four or five

456
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,369
okay

457
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,239
[Music]

458
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,039
Tolson tapped on my shoulder some hour

459
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,409
or so ago if I was interested in a

460
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,619
lightning talk so I couldn't make a

461
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,399
choice as usual so I got permission for

462
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,019
two lightning talks and I think I want

463
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,450
to start with this one and that's about

464
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,830
document foundation many of you will

465
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,489
know and some many maybe want oh about

466
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,109
all the good work that's being done

467
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:57,149
behind the scenes to support the

468
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:01,440
development of this great ODF tooling

469
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,889
it's called Libre Office the document

470
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:07,019
foundation it's this foundation behind

471
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,179
it and apart from the the LibreOffice

472
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,679
project it also hosts the document

473
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,389
liberation fronts so providing all the

474
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:20,639
nice document filters and adding new

475
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:32,129
ones who did so very short front it's

476
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:34,710
the document liberation project to be

477
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,700
honest but it is so yeah I like

478
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,989
liberation fronts okay TDF is houses

479
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:47,929
libre office and yes we started in about

480
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:51,040
2010 and this is solid

481
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,230
berlin-based stiff ting behind it and

482
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,110
statues and all the stuff but what is it

483
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,230
about basically people that are active

484
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,050
working on all kind of LibreOffice tears

485
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,260
can say I want to be member and later I

486
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,110
will explain to you why it is important

487
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,470
to be a member and and of course there

488
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,760
is a there you can be accepted as a

489
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,280
member for one year and after a year you

490
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,010
are invited to apply again if you are

491
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,590
doing good stuff and there's a

492
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,240
membership committee it's mentioned

493
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,030
below that's looking over the process of

494
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,090
people being member of not in between

495
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,790
there's the board of directors

496
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,560
the Board of Directors does great stuff

497
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,700
to make the whole sting the whole thing

498
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,360
going on both the membership committee

499
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,820
and the board of directors obviously are

500
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,020
chosen from the members and then we have

501
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,580
the engineering steering committee where

502
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,280
oldest engineers and people that are

503
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,010
related and interested discuss about

504
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,900
what's really going on and and not an

505
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,270
official body in in the sense that it

506
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,130
has a voting right or whatever it's

507
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,740
advisory board all kind of organizations

508
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,050
interested and this is the last slide

509
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,160
about TDF and this is how it shows the

510
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,370
Board of Trustees below it's not just

511
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,760
members but there's also some formal

512
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,270
legal legal Rose death White's Gold

513
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,200
Board of Trustees and from the board of

514
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,420
trustees we choose the Membership

515
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:31,960
Committee

516
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,590
every two years and the other two years

517
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,740
so that's intermediate the board of

518
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,680
directors is chosen and why the Board of

519
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,040
Directors is so very important because

520
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,180
Libre Office apart from all the great

521
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,910
stuff that developers do there's a lot

522
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,570
of work behind the scenes that's

523
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,330
enabling the work in in case of

524
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,780
infrastructure and people supporting

525
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,190
and whatever and that is made possible

526
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,530
by all people that make donations and

527
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,920
the board of directors nits off together

528
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,080
and finds the the the projects and the

529
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,780
tooling that needs support so the Board

530
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,530
of Directors looks after spending money

531
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,350
well for Libre Office development so

532
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,040
that's about TDF and anyone interested

533
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,290
in being a member because if you are a

534
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,780
member you can vote or even stand for

535
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,870
the board of directors is welcome to go

536
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,060
to document from decision document

537
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,790
Foundation Board or work so far this one

538
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,170
so that was my presentations one anyone

539
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,700
else questions

540
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:03,230
TDF okay then on top here in the maybe

541
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:09,230
I'll just start the second thing I want

542
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,510
to talk about is is a product called

543
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,390
leave relax and let me just show it

544
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,340
leave relaxed is something that gives

545
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,890
you a dialogue and to start document

546
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,990
production and it has some nice features

547
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,760
and it has some old-school sides as well

548
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,570
it started years ago I'm running a small

549
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,370
company in the Netherlands and we doing

550
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,400
some support for organisations using

551
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,440
LibreOffice and prior to that

552
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,830
openoffice.org and this is typically old

553
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,130
school within your office application

554
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,020
you start something and to create your

555
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,220
documents and even a long time ago it

556
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,320
was all a hard coded and this is

557
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,770
flexible it's based on configuration

558
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:06,970
files so here if you choose and not

559
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:14,250
document you see that this this dialogue

560
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,190
dialogue is dynamically built rebuilt

561
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,179
based on the on the configuration files

562
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:29,760
and if let me take this one as you see

563
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,010
there are some language information here

564
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:36,270
and you have some Lester's they are

565
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,190
madam and if you choose to make it

566
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,470
English you see that both the date and

567
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,040
the lists all the stuff changes it's all

568
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,500
based on configuration files and you

569
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,210
have if you prefer your settings well

570
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,250
also you can have choices in templates

571
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:07,050
for presentations for example if you

572
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,690
have a this is a memo document and you

573
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,820
can start it and this is demo and when

574
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,640
you hit OK you get both the document and

575
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,250
you get some predefined file naming and

576
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:30,990
you can start the content in case it's

577
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,450
in some protected section whatever stuff

578
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,470
you can edit it and there is some stuff

579
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,809
that you might want to print it with

580
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,059
logo on black and white or send it as

581
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:47,160
PDF or stuff like that and emailing that

582
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,860
it automatically is mailed as PDF with

583
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,650
logo or as word file to someone if he

584
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,500
needs to edit it that's that kind of

585
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,950
stuff that makes working in an office

586
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,880
documents often easier there's one thing

587
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,290
that I want to show about flexibility so

588
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,570
we have the the memo document here and

589
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,400
for example this it can be made shorter

590
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,880
this

591
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,720
and you can add extra fields and I can

592
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,670
show that here's the configuration file

593
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,920
and I just prepared some new lines

594
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,979
[Music]

595
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,159
I have to save it

596
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:04,179
of course maybe see now this is a short

597
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:07,750
one and additionally there's this type

598
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,119
of information available well that's all

599
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,899
nice and fun I started to open sources

600
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,010
last year this is now open source code

601
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,460
it's all old-school basic old-school

602
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,969
basic I open sourced it it was in the in

603
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,030
in the planning anyway and there was

604
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,849
some some work in in the dialog handling

605
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,090
with GTA III or whatever and that's

606
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,000
fixed now but if you look at the

607
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,710
configuration stuff that's a bit

608
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:45,580
old-school and of course the the ideas

609
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,599
that it's it's it can be easily linked

610
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,379
to documents management services or that

611
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:55,540
you create the documents from a document

612
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,780
management system and that if it is

613
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,359
needed it can be picked up in

614
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,290
LibreOffice and do stuff with with auto

615
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,470
text files and stuff like that that's

616
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,780
all well ideas that are possible in

617
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,920
future but this is just how it should be

618
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,599
to start from yes it's just here and

619
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,330
when it's published somewhere I I can

620
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,400
just share it with you but it's not CSE

621
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,770
not in a public repository yet

622
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,729
[Music]

623
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,270
I I think it's LLL do p3 plus something

624
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:52,170
like it yes what's the difference

625
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,830
any more questions okay thank you

626
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:03,660
[Applause]

627
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,839
so we have two more talks

628
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:27,719
genex perhaps next next one up with

629
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,239
young Malik gloriosky from city of

630
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,189
Munich one of the really large German

631
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:40,059
deployments of libre office some 17 K

632
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:45,339
seats I think running lib refers most of

633
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,269
them on Linux and he's been even active

634
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:53,609
in the project since when 2008 nine

635
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,119
[Music]

636
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,319
okay okay so instead we have while we're

637
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,329
solving the technical issues and this is

638
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,950
Olivier and you will be talking about

639
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,230
the new help system yes I would like to

640
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,049
show you what we have achieved so far

641
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:31,240
and it's basically a new URL it's VM 173

642
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:42,470
that document foundation.org and of

643
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,619
course we have some issues on the on the

644
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:49,759
CSS but what we have here is a an

645
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:52,220
imitation of what is the help system

646
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,249
this is the browser this is the page

647
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:58,880
rendered by the transformation we have

648
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,519
also collected all the bookmarks in the

649
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,200
XIV files and if you click on one of

650
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,190
these you get the page and on the top

651
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,609
you have a search bar that if you type a

652
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:18,680
specific keyword it's supposed to be to

653
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,529
collect all the mentions of calc into

654
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,769
this and then you can then navigate I

655
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:29,480
have one more things to show what we you

656
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,589
see here is is on debugging the XML you

657
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:40,730
see that you can this is pure HTML that

658
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,910
is has been transformed okay so we try

659
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,329
to preserve yes what we have here is

660
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:53,150
only the the index dot XML which is the

661
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,390
entry page there is a there is a

662
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,989
JavaScript micro server running there

663
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:05,599
okay so that takes the links and

664
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,920
transforms inside with JavaScript I also

665
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,619
would like to show if you can type after

666
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:19,930
the URL slash index dot HTML

667
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,660
and then a question mark question mark

668
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:33,230
page equal equal share it share it slash

669
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:47,850
test dot X Ashe HP test dot x HP yeah so

670
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,030
I have modified the transformation to

671
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,900
include a new multimedia so you can have

672
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,210
at the page with the multimedia right

673
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,760
now on the browser ad but you can't have

674
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,970
it on the current help system so if you

675
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,300
start the multimedia it goes to YouTube

676
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,390
and brings you the ok so this is what we

677
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,190
have achieved so far in trying to bring

678
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,960
the health system into a more modern

679
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:27,890
technology that's it ok just one thing

680
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,810
we plan I think it's a good idea to have

681
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,600
this system bundled into an extension ok

682
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,400
so it can what it may be interesting to

683
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,650
distribute in a different way rather

684
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,900
than installing packages ok and it can

685
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,050
be you can run locally or in a server

686
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,350
yeah thank you

687
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,880
[Applause]

688
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,509
okay so let me try - okay help me which

689
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:14,829
what's the name of the of your slides

690
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,059
after those technical problems or laptop

691
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:43,549
and everything this is just a little

692
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:45,949
overview about stuff and I've been doing

693
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,739
in mini for the last two months

694
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,689
something like that with some breaks

695
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,900
Libre Office processes all stuff to do

696
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,599
in an event loop and Libre Office it's

697
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,689
called task loop and the current origin

698
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:07,089
where I'm coming from

699
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:10,279
yeah there are two different types of

700
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:12,559
tasks some are timers which are

701
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,229
somewhere executed in the future and

702
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:22,209
some idols which executing instantly

703
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:25,699
some definition of busy so at some point

704
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:28,069
Libra office says I'm busy so at this

705
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:31,519
point no idle tasks should run but this

706
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,349
is very strange implemented in different

707
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:34,640
backends

708
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,219
and some pecans even do not implement it

709
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,999
at all so this is kind of a crazy

710
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:47,449
definition of busy there's the main

711
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:50,390
problem is that it's really kind of

712
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,759
random how LibreOffice processes the

713
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:54,739
stuff so even if you say okay process

714
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,439
the next event or tasks or whatever

715
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:00,759
sometimes it processes - if a system for

716
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:04,579
event is there sometimes it was in two

717
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,819
LibreOffice events this is not really

718
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:10,039
idealistic from the point of view if you

719
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:12,289
want to know how stuff is running in

720
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:14,809
libreoffice and then there are some

721
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:15,800
really

722
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,020
freaky stuff like there is some commence

723
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,380
and Omega aspect and we're saying Oh at

724
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,080
some time we are losing timer events

725
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,020
nobody knows why it's the commenter from

726
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,170
2000 really yeah they are quite from

727
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:36,310
very old code and yeah so this is really

728
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:40,940
what the code at that point and we

729
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,090
have heard that today and talk from

730
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,570
Michael Meeks about parallel processing

731
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,450
with talk with threats that already

732
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,640
there are a lot of problems there and

733
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
when I was started and looking into this

734
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,560
code I can understand why there are

735
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,570
problems because seems that everybody

736
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:04,000
just for every pack in that code they

737
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,050
implemented rocky rounds instead of

738
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,180
rewriting the whole stuff from scratch

739
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,020
with a normal idea and how a normal way

740
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,350
normal tasks and event loops working two

741
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,890
days and two wickets so where we are

742
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:24,740
currently we it's only scheduled by

743
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,950
priority now so like all the normal

744
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,950
event loops every event or tasks as a

745
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,430
priority and it's gated like that so we

746
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,140
do you know are completely those busy

747
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,640
stuff that's really crazy anyway the

748
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,860
other thing is that libreoffice was

749
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,410
mayor more or less polling with a task

750
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,330
with just occurred in because we were

751
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,640
missing some time a timer toss sometimes

752
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,090
so we started just to polish so in case

753
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,390
we missed something we found a way to

754
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,390
continue the stuff the single system

755
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,700
timers work except for macros because I

756
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,370
don't have a Mac OS platform yes I will

757
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,820
get one yet sometimes I trust them and

758
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,220
then I hopefully can fix a Mac OS back

759
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,650
and to said it has a single system

760
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,120
timers then there was a strange we have

761
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,850
feature that every task has to wait at

762
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,730
least one milliseconds for what ever

763
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,030
reason I don't know this was very

764
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,670
strange to I dropped a two and I didn't

765
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:29,420
see anything

766
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,369
while that couldn't work in the future

767
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,790
at least all the units which were there

768
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,650
still are working the refactoring of all

769
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,400
that code made also I made it in that

770
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,599
way is that all single tasks and patches

771
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,849
passed all the unit tests and even I

772
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:52,940
added some more unit tests to tests real

773
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,339
strange stuff like round robin when you

774
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,400
have two tasks with the same priority

775
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,730
they are currently scheduled no they are

776
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,940
not scheduled because when first the

777
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,609
first task is working all the time until

778
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:08,390
it is finished

779
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,099
even with its protests multiple times

780
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:12,079
and then the second task is just

781
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,240
tackling and a little around running at

782
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:21,500
that point fix that too and one really

783
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,260
stressful test which I finds because

784
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,960
sometimes I really made passionate and

785
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,270
all the unit tests still passed but for

786
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,040
the desktop unit tests and LibreOffice

787
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,980
kit UNICEF's are so complex that

788
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,750
normally they instantly fail if

789
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,910
something is wrong in the event

790
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,170
management or in without handling so

791
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,990
that's the current status that missing

792
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,809
is basically even make arrest stuff so

793
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:51,200
what we are coming to is that we run the

794
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,839
LibreOffice event loop just from a

795
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,309
system timer we don't have the polling

796
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:00,589
so we just restart the system timer to

797
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:04,250
to execute exactly when the next task is

798
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,680
valid or even if it's zero seconds which

799
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,040
exciting we instantly returns and

800
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,829
process that we I had the strange

801
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,220
situation when I reflected some code and

802
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,160
merged it that it became faster that

803
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,680
unit test broke because they were too

804
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,059
fast but I fixed those unit us now and

805
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:32,059
what we are going went and won to have

806
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:36,829
us to have locking so currently the the

807
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:40,460
unit main loop is not multi-threading

808
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,109
safe we

809
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,910
have already have those problems where

810
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,910
are some events and our tasks are

811
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,739
created in an hour strats and then

812
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,299
around in the main loop and then stuff

813
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:53,839
simply breaks and we want to get that -

814
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,680
this is currently hard because the tasks

815
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,559
they're owned by the threats so I guess

816
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,319
it really basically the only solution to

817
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:05,779
that it's currently to have a main

818
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:07,789
global lock for the event loop and lock

819
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:29,619
it and so you can release the stuff just

820
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,930
not owning the top and then normally on

821
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,970
by reinventing food and we want to have

822
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,569
certainly brofist - crazy stuff get rid

823
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:48,950
of that my original point was that

824
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,019
something's changed in there and made

825
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:53,720
much got very very something changed in

826
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,190
that codes and managed got very very

827
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,259
slow for more than 300 documents and I

828
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,809
said every time I thought I fixed it

829
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,950
I found something new it's crazy and

830
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,400
it's a little bit hard because yeah it's

831
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,829
a very lower ground and plumbing in

832
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:11,150
libreoffice and if you change something

833
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,789
there everything by expectantly it's a

834
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:16,390
little bit hard

835
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,080
I mean I already landed some refactoring

836
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,780

837
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,400

thanks for that and we have five minutes

844
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,070
left

845
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,890
um what I would be curious to hear some

846
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,380
feedback from you guys so what was the

847
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,930
talk that you missed that was not here

848
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,910
in the staff room so that we should

849
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,280
really have next year or any other

850
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:23,250
feedback you you want to say something

851
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,180
I'm only a user of it and I use it maybe

852
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,109
half a year no longer because before I

853
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:34,150
came from Windows and then they changed

854
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,760
to Windows 10 and then I changed to

855
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,050
Linux and I'm happy the set but there's

856
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,150
no office and I need office and so I

857
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,200
used to leave office so you would have

858
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,410
liked some some more user focused topics

859
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,240
or I mean there was the sleep relax that

860
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
was clearly um I really loved it I would

861
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,100
like to try that do anything that when I

862
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,640
call this out

863
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:06,000
once again homie ok it was ok

864
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:15,400
interesting what kind of problems we

865
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,320
have with a smiling face anything else

866
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,890
any kind of feedback anything at all

867
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:29,020
