1
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,220
so I'm here today to present you Polly

2
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,320
muff Libre platform

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,390
liebherr video game platform yeah so

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,470
just to start quite clear to narrow a

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,470
bit what we're doing in polymath the

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,870
idea is to produce video games

7
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,450
interactive experiment and live

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,930
performance so we are a group of people

9
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,510
working on this the crew just to mention

10
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,880
them because they are important Virginia

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,340
and I started the the polymer project

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,740
six months ago Peter Edelman and

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,520
Balthazar

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,659
who's there is to developers and which

15
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,180
joined us and she's a choreographer and

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,990
a blender artist so the background of

17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,870
the project just to explain you a bit

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,210
what we what I have in mind when I say

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,440
interactive experiments and life stay

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,729
live performance this project is a

21
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,659
school tanukis and it's a performance in

22
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:39,220
which I'm the avatar is a puppet and I

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,710
play with it real time and a friend of

24
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,229
mine Loic is doing the music and so we

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,840
perform on stage and we so it's mock-up

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,970
played in real time and then I activate

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,939
effects this kind of thing I'm just

28
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,909
going to skip a bit of it so they were

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,890
sound this is sort of like it's quite

30
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,430
important

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,829
so when I'm when I'm talking about

32
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,758
experiment experimenting with video game

33
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,680
technologies it's - this kind of thing

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,510
that I am thinking so that is in this

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,020
project I've

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,070
walk trot on the animation part and I

37
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:30,960
recorded I did a new motion system in

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,470
unity

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,959
so all the thing that animate the avatar

40
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,040
a custom animation engine on the right

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:50,090
you see that it's controlled via so it's

42
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,440
controlled by a MIDI controller and apps

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,750
so via tablet another part of the

44
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,290
project was to work on in an interactive

45
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,989
installation involving a dancer so this

46
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,420
time real time without any recording and

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,709
this is a video of residency that has

48
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,410
been made in Himmel it's a center for

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,090
digital art in Brussels and for this

50
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,360
it's a research with I started a new

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,920
media it's a research lab linked to the

52
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,680
university of news and the ideas will

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,380
have a mock-up system made of connects

54
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,140
so we have four connects merge together

55
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,299
and providing the animation data to the

56
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,650
2d avatar as you see it's not yet

57
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,489
perfect its bleaching a bit but it start

58
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,790
works

59
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,730
yeah not just a bit

60
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,569
[Music]

61
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,799
it's still under development and just to

62
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,829
skip a bit and show you that it's

63
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,790
working also with several people in the

64
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,040
room so the idea of mixing several

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
connects together us to do this kind of

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,330
thing so we have a bigger area covered

67
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,150
by the connects and we are also able to

68
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,770
see people from different angles so the

69
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,259
working on this project is two or three

70
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,279
years I'm working on it the main thing I

71
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,939
didn't do in this project is the game

72
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,689
engine itself and I was using unity and

73
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,660
so because I'm had some problem with it

74
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,639
[Music]

75
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,830
start to think about it but I first have

76
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,499
to present you the tools that I'm using

77
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,529
before and that has influenced the way I

78
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,610
did the polymer engine so I'm coming

79
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,769
from creative coding I don't know if

80
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,529
several of you know processing open

81
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:13,349
framework and this kind of stuff so it's

82
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,360
mainly text-based frameworks simplified

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,599
really easy to get into and so I started

84
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,979
with processing it's an IDE with Java I

85
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,809
use blender a lot all store I made some

86
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,659
experimentation with qt and I worked a

87
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,139
lot or so with open framework with C++

88
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,379
framework and it's a sin thin layer

89
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,069
above

90
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,699
OpenGL so it's very good they do a lots

91
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,199
of things but when you come to 3d 2d

92
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,300
game or more complex scenes it doesn't

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,250
do the job correctly it's not powerful

94
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,910
enough

95
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,099
so during two years I started a quest

96
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:04,139
and the first thing I tried as you saw

97
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,020
was unity and I'm starting a bit of

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,000
comparison here looks a bit like the

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,220
replicator in my point of view it's very

100
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,099
nice the design everything is perfect

101
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,889
you have nice buttons at the top it's

102
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,750
very easy to use and you can print nice

103
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,720
stuff for that but you cannot open the

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,569
box and I need to have access to the to

105
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,030
the Codex especially for the animation

106
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,690
or to to plug different libraries it was

107
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,550
too closed for me so I tried another one

108
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,770
Unreal Engine it's open-source

109
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,349
ok it's the license for better to do

110
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,889
things but it was a good engine the

111
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,870
industry r1 and related to the to the

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,330
power to the power of the of the engine

113
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,789
is the complexity of the engine and I

114
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,740
didn't wanted to go to start learning an

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,419
engine for one year before doing

116
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,060
something I want to go a bit faster than

117
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,229
that so it forced me to re-evaluate my

118
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,030
needs and what I expected

119
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,099
and this is what I was searching for in

120
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,180
fact it was different libraries with a

121
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,969
guide to put them together and the

122
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,060
ability also to make it evolve with the

123
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,610
time so change peace constant the

124
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,409
physical engine I want to be able to

125
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,940
plug another one if I need to change the

126
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,639
sound engine put whatever I want and

127
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,560
make

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,260
they made game engine depending on the

129
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,490
project I'm working on

130
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,310
so choosing which piece I put together

131
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,360
and so I made a bit of research and I

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,850
ended up by selecting these tools so the

133
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,950
pure data was using it for two years so

134
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,410
it was quite directly in the in the pipe

135
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,850
it can do graphical interface you can do

136
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,580
real-time calculation and it can do

137
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,280
sounds obviously or so so it was

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,190
directly in the pot all the auger has

139
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,160
been a bit more difficult to to find

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,430
because it was in a shortlisted with

141
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,919
Alex I don't know if some of you knows

142
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,590
this engine so it's an an open-source

143
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,070
rendering engine or so but when I looked

144
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,260
at the specs and the community behind

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,240
all those seems a better choice because

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,370
there was much more thing already

147
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,640
prepared in order

148
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,870
and when a one-year last

149
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,420
in June last year they were releasing

150
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,740
the version two of the engine so it was

151
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,560
it seems to me a good choice I want to

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,020
tell physical engine into it so I shot

153
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,090
listed bullet also because it's very

154
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,700
well-documented and easy to use and

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,690
several of the tools so on the top of

156
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,390
the screen is everything that I didn't

157
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,430
do myself in the lower part in in Aus

158
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,560
it's everything that comes from the

159
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,660
project that I did before like this is

160
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,880
the animation engine for the Avatar that

161
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,490
coming from tanuki the multi connect

162
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,100
system that I talked about or so under

163
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,779
mental play with the mental editor is a

164
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,540
nonlinear timeline editor did done by

165
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,360
yes inceptive is there is working

166
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,580
actively on it for several years and it

167
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,670
allows you to really manage the timing

168
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,850
of of an interaction of whatever you

169
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,600
want and to make transition between them

170
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,310
so I showed I said to everybody that I

171
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,140
was going to do the project in June so

172
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,200
in July I start coding and because I did

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
open framework before and what kind of

174
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
programming I was thinking okay odd will

175
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,530
not be a huge issue

176
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,600
[Music]

177
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
yeah

178
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,470
it took me about two months to really

179
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,800
get into work and to get her which was

180
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,170
working all the layers and all the

181
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,230
managers inside of it and the idea of

182
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,600
the polymorph engine is to avoid you

183
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,930
this state of mind and provide you

184
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,380
something a bit more easy to use so now

185
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,820
nowadays okay we are at veteran 0.1 I'm

186
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,500
not taking too much risk yeah it's

187
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,800
really the first version it's still and

188
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,920
ready in the a pack of code and not

189
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,110
everything is debug not everything is

190
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,480
done to synchronize everything but at

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
least when you download the engine you

192
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,700
will get this you will get order do that

193
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,300
link to auger you will get a walk off of

194
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,050
pure data I'll link to SDL to send the

195
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,450
sound to the graphical card to the sun

196
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,860
card sorry the gamepad thing is etc it

197
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,800
was not included into our you get open

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,810
source

199
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,340
I see open zone control so it's a UDP

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,720
work path that allows you to communicate

201
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,240
between me between many applications I

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,550
don't know if some of you knows about it

203
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,090
but it's quite common in creative coding

204
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,050
and in live performance this format

205
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,810
XML is there not because I can parse XML

206
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,330
it's quite straightforward to parse in

207
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,390
cement but because I provide with the

208
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,210
package a way to describe scenes and

209
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,540
project in XML

210
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,890
Oh doesn't give you the any kind of

211
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,490
external seam description format so I

212
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,590
would show you after that how it's done

213
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,130
and several assets and but the important

214
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,400
thing about polymorph is that i try to

215
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,510
make it simple so here what I'll show

216
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,240
you is the way to I want to create a

217
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,390
cube and to add physics to it and this

218
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,100
is the kind of code you have to write

219
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,880
you know in order to get it ranking so

220
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,830
you got nodes you get entities you get

221
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,600
to link them together you have to load a

222
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,970
ABB so it's bounding box you have to set

223
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,370
the the material on the cube etcetera

224
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,260
etcetera and after that here at the

225
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,720
bottom it's everything to prepare the

226
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,300
relation with bullet and get back the

227
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
information from the physical engine to

228
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,080
your object etc so this is what is

229
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,040
behind and here is what it gives when

230
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,580
you use in polymorph engine so you just

231
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,940
create a P node so everything is perfect

232
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,810
by P so you create a P node you say it's

233
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,440
a cube and you can add the scene manager

234
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,140
and its name and then you can declare it

235
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,200
has the physics of the box so it's I

236
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,930
think it's quite straightforward to use

237
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,770
and the line below the XML is the same

238
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,910
thing but in XML format then you can

239
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,670
load it into into your application and

240
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,000
directly have the end object

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,160
pre-configured for you you have

242
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,000
questions married

243
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,119
so let's inside the package so first of

244
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,209
all the simplified API I have an empty

245
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:47,240
project I think it's quite important to

246
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,100
have an empty project you can just copy

247
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,589
paste and start coding into it and to

248
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,910
discover and test things simple examples

249
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,600
also showing you different feature of

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,110
augur of PD and out to make them

251
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,980
communicate outer radius sets so I'll go

252
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,410
games with wall system of shader

253
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,509
management and compositor management

254
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,579
this is also available in the examples

255
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,779
blender files documentation etc etc

256
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,470
about the OS I'm working on Linux so for

257
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,019
the moment it's only what you can

258
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,660
install quite easily we are one script

259
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,480
the wall engine on Linux windows a

260
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,529
friend of mine is working on it

261
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:50,920
oh yeah that's my battery 406 it will

262
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,220
come a bit later auger is where it's

263
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,880
working on

264
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,700
although it's working on a on a knife

265
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,050
six version once they will be done I

266
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:15,380
will integrate it but not before about

267
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,190
the license

268
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,340
it's the the code is released in the bsd

269
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,630
and bsd license and all the assets are

270
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,220
in Creative Commons so you can go and

271
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,270
pick it pick what you want inside of it

272
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:36,860
sorry what I had after that I just have

273
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,900
to be built

274
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,049
[Music]

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,860
yeah well something important is also

276
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,590
okay something important or so is that

277
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,490
the the engine will will evolve with the

278
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,060
project we do with it so it's not like

279
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,980
we're gonna wait to have a full engine

280
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,640
to start building application it will be

281
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,090
a mix between development of the engine

282
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,030
and project developments so depending on

283
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,700
the project we're taking several feature

284
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,750
will appear the first feature the link

285
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,470
with bullets

286
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,100
has been made for project that I will

287
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,430
show you

288
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,410
so we are starting

289
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,150
yeah

290
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,070
okay

291
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,579
so I'm gonna go back here and directly

292
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,810
show you the demo so this is the first

293
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,990
project we are working on with with the

294
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,830
engine it's it's called tuning score and

295
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,380
the idea here is to work on the with a

296
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,550
American choreographer with called

297
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,310
listen Nelson and there is a publication

298
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,910
about hard work and this game will

299
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,960
demonstrate we'll give a 3d version of

300
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,510
the of its of its theory so it's a

301
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,410
two-player games you see the position of

302
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,190
the other played online so you play with

303
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,650
somebody you don't know about you see

304
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,750
what the other is doing and knowing you

305
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,890
can interact at the same time in the in

306
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,730
the same physical environment and we

307
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,390
make the object moves proposed

308
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,299
transformation and the objects and so on

309
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,679
so you can two players can pick the same

310
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,379
objects and play with it

311
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,409
real time so for those who have made a

312
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,769
bit of physical engine it's quite tricky

313
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:40,769
to do because the two engine will

314
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,389
dissing Crenn eyes so it will have to be

315
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,799
synchronized all the time

316
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,719
we are the other web so this is the

317
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:52,679
first project after that yeah after that

318
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,649
I wanted to show you the relation

319
00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:02,029
between pure data and and volume up

320
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,430
so I prepared two

321
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,790
to show you the integration

322
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:22,509
so what you see here it's deposit of the

323
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:27,580
cube rotating the exposition of the cube

324
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,239
make the pan change and the distance

325
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:36,070
made the volume change and this is send

326
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,729
via OSC to pure data to allow real-time

327
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:43,960
editing so what you see here is the data

328
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,330
retrieved in pure data position of the

329
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,229
cube retrieving pure data but you can

330
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:57,970
also process information here and send

331
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,989
it back to the engine I'm doing here

332
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,909
just make a novella and envelope

333
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,899
detection on the sound scale the the

334
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:15,399
sphere and and the second cube and copy

335
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,320
the position of the cube and the

336
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,989
rotation of the cube of the big cube on

337
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:26,460
the small one and I can modify this

338
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,530
I don't know this is the yep that's the

339
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,000
other two pattern translation yeah no

340
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,790
it's going below what I'm changing here

341
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,440
the ball is moving in the sinners with

342
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,540
with the same what i'm doing here is i'm

343
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,650
i'm putting more when i when you have to

344
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,050
screen it's a bit more visual it's a bit

345
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,230
more clear what you're doing that you

346
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,200
can also change the mapping of the data

347
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,250
between what's Olga is sending you and

348
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,580
what we're putting back in the engine so

349
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,490
this is the addition mode that allows

350
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,429
you to really change the behavior of the

351
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,370
sound and the behavior of the object

352
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,520
variable data

353
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,710
by using custom object made for this you

354
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,769
can also just run the engine sorry it's

355
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,889
not this one that's this one you can run

356
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:42,240
the engine with the patch loaded inside

357
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,249
the engine without changing anything to

358
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,490
the patch so you can really use pure

359
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,789
data to edit and then you just have to

360
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,100
integrate it and launch it in release

361
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,610
mode

362
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,689
[Music]

363
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,210
I have several little yeah just show

364
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,499
this one I'm going fast this one is show

365
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:14,419
you one that you can edit

366
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,350
you can edit skeletons you can visualize

367
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,100
the the structure of the nature of the

368
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,640
skeleton and play with it real time this

369
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,840
is quite simple I have another I have

370
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,550
another D move about shaders mainly you

371
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,010
will see that yeah I can move the

372
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,440
objects change the background effects

373
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,830
and then I control the evolution of the

374
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,540
shader I can enable another one exit

375
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:02,950
track cetera so it's 3d game engine many

376
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,580
other things but as the time go by do

377
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:21,610
you have any questions look at Lua is a

378
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,110
nice scripting language

379
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,519
[Music]

380
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,580
maybe well maybe later not for now

381
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,940
because there was a lot to do in C++ but

382
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,360
yeah definitely it would be it would be

383
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,379
cool but I didn't do it yet so if if I

384
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,159
do other it's there is abiding for Java

385
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,629
and Python for over but it has to be

386
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:50,669
integrated the classes I did have to be

387
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,619
in trigger integrated with that or so so

388
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,409
it's not ready yet

389
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,290
other questions yeah

390
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,450
[Music]

391
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:38,009
completion time the thing I did so the

392
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,429
first question was about how can be dumb

393
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,169
enough to think that building a my own

394
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:45,149
engine will be faster than mastering

395
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,120
unity or unreal and the second one is

396
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,419
about competition time so the for the

397
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:58,320
first question I don't I don't think I

398
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,220
can I will do better than unity unreal

399
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,059
not for now maybe
