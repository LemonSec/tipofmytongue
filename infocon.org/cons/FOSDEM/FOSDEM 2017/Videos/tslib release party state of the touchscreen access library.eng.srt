1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,720
hello everybody

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,219
our next speaker is Martin Keplinger he

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,590
changed the name of his talk so it's

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,260
Tesla the touchscreen access library is

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,760
back please give him a warm welcome

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,759
hello everybody so I will talk a little

7
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,990
bit about my recent input system

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,680
development in the TS sleep library I

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,590
will get to what TS sleep actually is in

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,149
a minute so I started working on this on

11
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,420
this library because my employer wanted

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,180
me to in its t asleep it's important for

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,870
us and specifically I did multi-touch

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,629
support and last year soon I became the

15
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,489
maintainer of the project itself and

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,680
really quickly really fast

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,340
I did a release 1.2 is the first release

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,390
I did and at my company somebody came up

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,030
to me and he was choking you know this

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,180
is the second release of the thing in

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,280
ten years

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,990
there should be a huge release party now

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,640
and of course maybe that would be a

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,060
little over the top for a tiny input

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,510
library but initially I had to call my

26
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,460
talk the release valve so quickly I want

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,320
to add that my employer obviously thats

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,230
Kinzinger electronic systems is a member

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,660
of the old cell organization we support

30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,460
free software that way of but of course

31
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,550
everything I do is on github and

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,110
actually everything I think about this

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,670
project is on github

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,130
the releases are actually the outline of

35
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,910
my talk now so I will tell you what TS

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,690
lib is how and why it is used today and

37
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,310
has been used and

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,230
what i did what i added to the project

39
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,080
and what new use cases there might be

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,010
for you nowadays so the TS leap is a sea

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,170
library

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,340
it simply enables or fixes touch input

43
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,730
and there are tools included to test to

44
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,630
quickly test and configure the library

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,320
what does it do

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,340
very easy it reads input samples from

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,870
your input device driver

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,000
it applies filters to it or yeah in any

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,850
way you want and any number of filters

50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,670
and it offers the resulting filtered

51
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,410
input stream of samples to users easy

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,730
right the color of the library is very

53
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,340
very tiny and basically only manages

54
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,180
plug-ins everything every real work is

55
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,060
done in a plugin or module there are two

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,430
kinds of module there are hardware

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,370
modules or raw modules as we call them

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,700
and filter plugins or modules

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,530
let's get to an example okay what we

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,960
have here is a complete TS conf

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,090
configuration file that's everything

62
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,800
that's a complete example you would use

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,440
one raw module to access your you know

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,600
input device driver and that's also the

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,620
point here this thing is really old it

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,090
it was basically written because device

67
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,810
drivers didn't have standard like they

68
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,310
have nowadays with the normal Linux

69
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,649
input event system so in this case an

70
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:23,410
egg Alex something driver is used and

71
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,080
needs a module to access the specific

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,360
drivers samples and you would apply in

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,270
this case three filters to it you know

74
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,520
what they actually do

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,100
brian's tries to filter out huge jumps

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,260
in touch samples that shouldn't be there

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,320
digit well digit so when you don't move

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,830
your pen or finger since especially on

79
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,850
resistive touchscreens the hardware

80
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,400
would have you know jitter and linear

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,650
does real linear transformation of your

82
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,750
X&Y positions

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,440
to quickly test the experience you

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,960
created now there is simply TS test we

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,280
won it and you will try it out so use

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,000
this thing

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,060
ts test for example implements TS lips

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,490
api TS read so there are also plugins

89
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,560
for cute or ex of what have you that

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,840
implement the ellipse api and they are

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,000
also in use today and the reason TS lips

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,570
the reason this thing was in use and i

93
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,510
want to add that it's it's used in many

94
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,650
commercial products - it was used in the

95
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,370
Nokia internet tablets back when I donno

96
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,600
2004 when was that and it was there to

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,580
enable touch in the first place the

98
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,810
hardware would really when you think

99
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,700
about with assistive touch screens they

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,380
were drift and everything and you needed

101
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,159
something to correct them all right

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,180
so what did i do what did I do

103
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,030
fortunately the world changed drivers

104
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,050
are you know standard Linux input

105
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,970
drivers you just have to leave the the

106
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,620
input events keys and codes and I did

107
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,100
multi-touch support the one hardware

108
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,180
plug-in you use in PS leap as soon as

109
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,840
you have a normal input system device

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,780
driver is called input and you basically

111
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,750
only need this one these days and I

112
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,280
added multi-touch support for this

113
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,220
module and for the filter modules in

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,030
this case you had a median filter when

115
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,430
you remember this from no statistics or

116
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,120
math class it's the median filter digit

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,850
again depants is about pressure values

118
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,190
and there is a whole new multi-touch API

119
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,560
now and of course the test programs for

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,410
multi-touch so remember once again it's

121
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,760
a portable C library

122
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,340
it's very configurable you only have to

123
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,410
compile what you need what modules you

124
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,720
need you can do this statically and

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,900
dynamically it should be stable it's

126
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,580
really old it works really well but why

127
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,930
would you use it today when you think

128
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,210
about capacitive touchscreens who have

129
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,820
fancy firmware in them you can already

130
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,920
configure really really good well you

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,500
can still use GS lip to really optimize

132
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,980
your user experience and the point is

133
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,290
you can do this at runtime you can even

134
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,950
think about changing the behavior of

135
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,020
your touch input experience I don't know

136
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,240
think about depending on your physical

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,300
environment or anything and in our case

138
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,020
we managed different touch screens in

139
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,150
our system and that's really easy by

140
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,270
just managing one small configuration

141
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,090
file and what I really like is I wrote a

142
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,380
little program you can run as a daemon

143
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,560
that now is basically a user space input

144
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,820
device driver

145
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,480
and 40 asleep so it offers you a new

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,740
standard Linux input device you can use

147
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,540
and you simply point your environment to

148
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,740
it and you're done

149
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,289
you don't need to implement TS lives API

150
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,860
anymore you might gain some performance

151
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,979
improvement if you still do but you

152
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,360
don't really have to we actually don't

153
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,750
so yesterday I ran some statistics

154
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,280
quickly so that you have a few names

155
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,150
Russell King actually wrote the asleep

156
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,980
in and his first initial you know in his

157
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,550
initial commit was in December of 2001

158
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,770
you might you might remember Russell

159
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,440
King for porting Linux to arm also

160
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,180
around that time I think and basically

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,480
after his initial commit Douglas Lauda

162
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,630
took over Chris Larson I think now does

163
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,360
anybody know if Chris Larson is here yet

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,060
foster I was wondering about I didn't

165
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,870
see him all right

166
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,340
he was maintaining the project before me

167
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,300
before I took over he did a really good

168
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,050
job the project is in a really good

169
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,050
State

170
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,860
and that's basically the overview of TS

171
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,970
lip in case you have questions you go

172
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,120
ahead now I can I could also tell you

173
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,980
what is what things are open and still

174
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,320
to do I could I don't know tell you

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,300
about the available filter plugins you

176
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,610
have but in case you have a question

177
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,280
just shout I come along with the mic

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,310
just give me a hand if you have a

179
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,689
question don't be shy

180
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,960
well they are all on get up but top

181
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,590
popular but well yes there is still a

182
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,140
minor issue with multi-touch when you

183
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,130
when you read the whole multi-touch

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,860
definitions there is a concept of not

185
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,350
only your touch contact but also the

186
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,570
tool the position of the tool you are

187
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,480
using beat your finger or your pen and

188
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,510
we don't yet apply all our filters to

189
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,720
the position of your tool in case you

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
have a real hardware that really

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
supports this kind of thing that's one

192
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,470
development issue we need documentation

193
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,570
we need more documentation and the

194
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,550
github wiki we didn't we don't have a

195
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,210
wiki

196
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:32,490
yet you could imagine doing more static

197
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,220
analysis or even passing or whatever but

198
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,350
just have a look at the guitar issues

199
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,450
anyone else no then thanks a lot for

200
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,460
your talk Matson

201
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:58,070
