1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,270
okay hey can you all hear me okay -

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,250
maybe I'll move this up

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,039
my name is Molly de Blanc and I wrote

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,630
this talk because I thought it was funny

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,880
and then it became much less funny so

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,090
I'm sorry if you don't laugh enough okay

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,530
if you become uncomfortable leave the

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,760
room that's the first thing you should

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,610
do then you can talk to the organizers

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,440
there are some wonderful people

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,629
Richard Fontana is here at Karen Sandler

12
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,420
Tom marble Bradley Bradley

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,670
well someone I don't know I forget um

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,739
and you can talk to me later but let's

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,960
not do that right now I'd really prefer

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,480
if you don't tweet angry awful things at

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,960
me because I talk about that but if you

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,640
feel really inclined just hashtag it

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,079
free software because not enough people

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,829
do that cool here are some things about

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,170
me I'm not an academic I have no

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,969
training in statistics demography

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,280
anthropology or sociology so I don't

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,810
actually know what I'm talking about but

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,030
like let's just run with it I took some

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,440
literature classes into college that

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,990
helps right I'm really interested in

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,730
free software I love free software it's

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,290
one of my favorite things in the world I

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,600
think copyleft is great I think sharing

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,250
is great I think being able to play with

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,830
the stuff that you have is great and I

33
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,060
thought you know I think we can do

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,070
better I think as a community we're good

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,830
but we could do better and sometimes we

36
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,570
succeed at this and sometimes we fail

37
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,060
I'll probably be offensive to someone in

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,220
this room and eventually at some point

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,920
we'll talk about policies and I swear my

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,390
presence is at least arguably relevant

41
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,610
so hopefully we'll laugh sometimes we'll

42
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,400
be upset or angry I will swear at least

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
I don't know if you want to but you're

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,390
welcome to and I'm gonna say some awful

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,240
things that may be triggering I'm not

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,610
speaking on behalf of foz dam or really

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,590
that people organizing this room and I

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,980
really hope I don't offend you too much

49
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,120
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,610
some background stuff standards you know

51
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,190
we commute we create community standards

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,288
as tools to help us understand what

53
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,550
we're doing

54
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,680
standards include things by the Free

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
Software Foundation and the open source

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,040
initiative these are

57
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,349
formal practices that help us define

58
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,299
what things are or what things aren't in

59
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:22,370
these particular cases these two groups

60
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,079
talk about what is free software and

61
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,030
what counts as open source through

62
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,609
formal definitions they've created we

63
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,650
also have best practices best best

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,900
practices can be formal or less formal

65
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,790
there are things everyone understands

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,829
while they're not required they're good

67
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,709
to have and then we have social

68
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,470
contracts Debian and Gen 2 both have

69
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,970
social contracts at least on their

70
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,310
websites these are kind of in between

71
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,530
the two people agree to them people sign

72
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,379
them people formally ascribe to the

73
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,159
ideals of a community and that's another

74
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,980
thing so now so some of these things are

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,450
prescriptive and some of them are

76
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,040
descriptive what something is

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,930
prescriptive it means we're saying you

78
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,450
should do this and this is the ideal and

79
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,639
when something is descripted instead

80
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,590
we're describing what's actually

81
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,139
happening and trying to create things

82
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,950
from that so one really great norm is us

83
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,040
saying awful things this was one of my

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,299
favorite things I've seen on Twitter

85
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,120
ever because free software I'm

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,769
gonna read all these in case anyone here

87
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,030
is blind there was a name here I changed

88
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,440
it go yourself

89
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,060
fake operator is free software that we

90
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,769
will fix at our own pace it's being

91
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,949
fixed you arrogant prick and actually

92
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,209
this is my favorite tweet of all time

93
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,370
just says it all

94
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,400
it says free software bt-dubs one

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
of the things I learned in looking at

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,699
Twitter is that people are really mean

97
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,250
sometimes I mean on the internet why are

98
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,620
people mean that's a Taylor Swift quote

99
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,659
if we got any Taylor Swift fans in the

100
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,799
house anyone okay just me it's fine

101
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,269
sometimes people are mean because they

102
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,250
think or know they're right and they

103
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,409
don't understand why other people don't

104
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,220
also think or know they're right

105
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,449
sometimes people are mean because they

106
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,639
feel like they're anonymous they can get

107
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,949
lost in the crowd because they can't be

108
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,750
necessarily be identified as an

109
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,370
individual there's less at stake

110
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,168
socially and professionally

111
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,900
here are some other reasons there can be

112
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,270
lack of repercussions if there's no

113
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,040
reason why being mean

114
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,710
has a negative effect why would you not

115
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,670
do it if you want to group think creates

116
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,170
context in which it's okay to kind of

117
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,780
all ascribe to the same idea even if you

118
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,280
don't necessarily believe it when you

119
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,250
first show up some examples of this in

120
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,560
online communities are people who are

121
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,080
male rights advocates or activists

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,760
people who are like in the red pill

123
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,970
community on reddit so people who like

124
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,950
kind of I'll start talking about awful

125
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,050
things together and get into it

126
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,670
and that kind of flows into cultural

127
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,770
norms cultural norms can also be

128
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,190
institutional at much broader levels

129
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,510
mental health and lacking sense of self

130
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,160
when people feel bad about themselves

131
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,870
they're much more inclined to try to

132
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,150
make other people feel bad and some

133
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,030
people are actually just mean Simon rego

134
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,210
who's a psychologist and a director of

135
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,580
several psychological of like several

136
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,020
psychological education programs

137
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,060
reminded us that when you're stripped of

138
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,070
nonverbal cues the patterns of speech

139
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,410
the rate tone and context you are left

140
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,630
with is a lot of guesswork he said this

141
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,640
when talking about how people talk

142
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,740
online and how people interpret what

143
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,870
other people say online so this is a lot

144
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,550
of text I'm really sorry I'm not gonna

145
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,140
say it all maybe you can read it on the

146
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,230
slides later a woman named Glenn G less

147
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,870
Lindy West had her father died and then

148
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,400
somebody who didn't like something she

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,590
was saying created a fake Twitter

150
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,570
account and a fake email account and

151
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,670
began sending her really awful things

152
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,780
from her father she wrote an article on

153
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,090
Jezebel about this experience and then

154
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,700
the person apologized it turns out that

155
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,070
not only do you Pierre feel powerful

156
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,220
when you feel anonymous you also feel

157
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,500
like people aren't people when they

158
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,360
don't have faces or they don't have real

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,220
names or they're just really far away

160
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,600
from you and you never get to see each

161
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,270
other when you talk to someone who's a

162
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,460
troll and can somehow personalize your

163
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,900
experience frequently they apologize

164
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,370
this person said I'm sorry and multiple

165
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,070
times in this email and at some point

166
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,780
which I deleted he says he feels bad

167
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,880
about himself as a person in general and

168
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,670
lashed

169
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,980
I promised you some swearing and

170
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,830
laughing and this isn't funny so we're

171
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,410
getting there soon I swear codes of

172
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,880
conduct Community Guidelines and other

173
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,490
creative names people come up with lots

174
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,550
of names to describe codes of conduct

175
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,110
frequently these are in mailing lists or

176
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,290
communities on forms or at events and

177
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,510
some of them I think are kind of silly

178
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,250
names I think code of ethics is kind of

179
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,470
a silly name because you're not actually

180
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,600
really talking about how people are

181
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,240
behaving or how people should behave

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,470
there's a lot of really great stuff out

183
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,040
there about writing codes of conduct the

184
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,320
most important thing that they do is

185
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,090
they create a language around what

186
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,680
behavior is bad and what behaviors

187
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,850
aren't allowed

188
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,440
ideally they also talk about

189
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,500
repercussions so how do I talk in public

190
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,950
this is the Twitter part what I did is I

191
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,900
looked up a bunch of search terms on

192
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,720
Twitter I gathered a few thousand tweets

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,640
work to them to get relevance my search

194
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,740
terms were all based on and either

195
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,110
free software or open source I don't

196
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,580
know if you've ever searched Twitter but

197
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,170
if you put little frowny faces and you

198
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,700
search terms it comes up with everything

199
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,160
it lists as negative sentiment and

200
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,050
Twitter has amazing sentiment analysis

201
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,790
actually so these are results I had much

202
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,250
less than several thousand some specific

203
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,670
data looking at free software and

204
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,080
most of them are actually relevant so

205
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,660
people who think to use the term free

206
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,230
software have useful things to say

207
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,810
useful things that weren't relevant

208
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,640
we're mostly focused on the cost of

209
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,100
software so one of my recommendations is

210
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,680
that when people somehow see tweets when

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,230
someone says like oh I'm sick of this

212
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,270
feat free software I got in

213
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,860
college and now I can't use it anymore

214
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,140
because my license expired since I'm no

215
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,940
longer a student you can like totally

216
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,950
reach out to them and go hey have you

217
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,590
tried this it's great and I respect your

218
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,120
freedoms this is an example of something

219
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,190
that was completely irrelevant the word

220
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,289
 appeared in it and the word free

221
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,270
software appeared in it but it wasn't

222
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,620
actually like really talking about

223
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,010
anything useful

224
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,140
we got sentiment for when things were

225
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,120
relevant when people said yes a number

226
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,650
of these were about to do whatever the

227
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,530
 you want licensed which is an

228
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,820
interesting choice of name there are

229
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,050
some good things about it and some bad

230
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,830
things about it

231
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,480
most of them unsurprisingly were

232
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,200
negative this is a breakdown of specific

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
topics community based ones are about

234
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,650
communities and how people interact in

235
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,930
them free software is kind of about the

236
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,630
idea of free software or specific

237
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,280
projects proprietary software

238
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,620
Phuc proprietary software try this

239
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,530
awesome piece of free software instead

240
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,240
huh positive stuff was frequently about

241
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
community or about free software in

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,970
general there are a few random things

243
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,590
this is more stuff this was using

244
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,680
hashtags so things in hashtags while

245
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,230
there were fewer results they were there

246
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,940
was a much greater sense of relevance

247
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,900
overall and these were more positive so

248
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,940
it turns out that when you think about

249
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,290
what you're saying enough to throw a

250
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,660
hashtag in front of it you end up with

251
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,220
like people being a little more

252
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,400
conscientious oh and they also like talk

253
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,240
about Nvidia turns out it's its own

254
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,790
category looking at free and open source

255
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,130
software you're also getting like larger

256
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,230
amounts of relevance and you're getting

257
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,780
people thinking more about what the

258
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,940
kinds of things that they're saying

259
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,850
these things are more angry I looked up

260
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,040
floss at one point with a hashtag and I

261
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,420
decided it was useless because it was

262
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,550
all about dentistry so one of the things

263
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,930
about Foss is people really don't like

264
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,390
proprietary software it turns out that

265
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,360
makes me happy so we're not always nice

266
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,220
here are some specific examples of ways

267
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,350
we're not always nice dear free software

268
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,930
foundation Thanks I was already aware of

269
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,970
SOPA and PIPA now you because I'd

270
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,950
like to learn Emacs before midnight if

271
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,300
you're trying to learn Emacs before

272
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,890
midnight you're probably doing it wrong

273
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,000
in some way and as someone who follows

274
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,910
the FSF's Twitter I would request or

275
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,640
suggest that you tweet at them in the

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,910
future whoever this is I am sorry if you

277
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,800
said any of these things I'm sure you're

278
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,400
great actually

279
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:06,810
oh that makes sense I love this one

280
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,759
 you Firefox three if I can't

281
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,410
download your free software when I want

282
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm just going to back go back to IE 7

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,810
and standards or Netscape dude

284
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,550
do you guys kind of know the history of

285
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,079
like open sourcing code in the first

286
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,000
place

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,970
no any okay so this is really funny

288
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,589
because I'm pretty sure it's Netscape

289
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,329
that was like the first major project to

290
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,740
say here's our code have fun so that

291
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,490
makes me giggle

292
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,829
every time it's hard to contribute to

293
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,899
your project you and you sicken me

294
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,560
suck my radical free software agenda

295
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,149
what's actually kind of nice about this

296
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,709
is they're being critical of something

297
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:45,410
that we sort of need to be critical of

298
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,839
BSD you with a pony I'm not

299
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,870
really sure how to take that one we'll

300
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,699
get later on - I like the word so

301
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,370
much I swear it's not too weird a bunch

302
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,040
is my name I couldn't write this word we

303
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,930
don't say it in America I don't know

304
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,899
what people do here love you for life

305
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,709
like you oh free software I

306
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,810
think they were meant to be positive I

307
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,579
labeled it as jerks to be safe there's a

308
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,290
lot of nuance I couldn't I tried to

309
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,940
actually find things out about these

310
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,339
people to see if it was at least in the

311
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,560
US socially acceptable for them to use

312
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,339
this language but I couldn't see in them

313
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,560
anonymity we also care about licenses

314
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,480
we'd like to talk about licenses what

315
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,339
the why is Android get going so

316
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,290
close it being faucets what made me love

317
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,449
it bloody Google see they tweet it at

318
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,389
Google it's useful I don't they didn't

319
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,649
get a response but they tried this these

320
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,060
sort of things also kind of make me

321
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,850
happy in a way I am not sure they're the

322
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,329
classiest things people could say but

323
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,550
they're definitely like expressing some

324
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,310
dedication to the idea and an investment

325
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,910
in free software itself retweet

326
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,550
slash dot the Android SDK is no longer

327
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,630
free software Android changed our SDK

328
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,339
and someone was mad about it as well

329
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,110
 you Red Hat

330
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,850
 you for imposing licensing

331
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,160
issues on free software I would

332
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,450
have said for you free software

333
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,709
I'm sorry for providing my Twitter

334
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,690
commentary right now but I've lots of

335
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,690
thoughts on how you should tweet in case

336
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,010
you're wondering the best weapon we have

337
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,140
for free software compliance is Debian

338
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,240
that team does not around there's

339
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,829
like a lot of Debian love on Twitter

340
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,560
actually a lot of positive things people

341
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,690
say about Debian sometimes they talk

342
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,760
about how hard it is to install this was

343
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
kind of a collection of things what I

344
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,430
sort of liked about this particular

345
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,500
section there are generally about

346
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,910
Mozilla and firefox I'm not going to

347
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,670
read them all is that it highlights that

348
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,290
people don't actually know what is

349
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,700
open-source and what is free software

350
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,070
not just from a definitional standpoint

351
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,930
but from what are we classifying in

352
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,170
these ways that urban terror HD

353
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,540
won't be open-source anymore they're

354
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,750
upset you messed up decision you're

355
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,940
messed up this isn't decisions sorry

356
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,709
show a little concern for open source

357
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,170
Twitter API let's shut down the count

358
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,899
API fuck'em because profits I

359
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,120
tentatively recommend reading the I

360
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,380
think it's like the first or second

361
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,529
chapter of free software free society

362
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,600
because it talks about this actually

363
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,640
like the relationship between profits

364
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,250
and decision making you can also read it

365
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,279
online somewhere it's free in different

366
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,800
ways there were again a tweets on Nvidia

367
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,829
that was pretty good we also care about

368
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,589
contribution apparently I don't know if

369
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,519
we care about it from the best

370
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,110
perspectives but we do care about it

371
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,600
dear people complaining about tiny

372
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,459
little problems and otherwise awesome

373
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,529
free software submit your bug then shut

374
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,990
the up in a way this is a call to

375
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,140
action but it's free software that means

376
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,699
you need to contribute back fix it

377
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,310
yourself or shut the up these two

378
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,040
contrast to each other because this one

379
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,240
about submitting your bug is actually

380
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,010
talking about like an easy way to make

381
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,260
commentary and to participate this one's

382
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,990
like much more complex I'll translate an

383
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,550
open-source project for free but two

384
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,050
commercial ventures who crowdsource

385
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,649
translation I say off and we also

386
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:24,480
have a lot of opinions about her sell

387
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
ourselves am I talking to

388
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,509
by the way okay great is Android really

389
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,459
free software more kind of commentary on

390
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,560
sort of how we're fitting together this

391
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,300
week we learned woman says is

392
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,310
considered a more important story than

393
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,139
free software project leader justifies

394
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,649
abusing contributors hey Foss project

395
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,899
maintainer Ziff the only people telling

396
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,180
you you need a code of conduct or COC

397
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,339
are people who don't even write code

398
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,670
then them we should replace what

399
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,379
the open-source with what's the fix

400
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,490
open-source so cute slash dot slash dot

401
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,680
says a lot of things about free software

402
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,269
and open source that like get really

403
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,879
upset what's great about this

404
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,009
contextually is it's actually about

405
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,709
slash doing site redesign but they

406
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,540
decided it was particularly relevant to

407
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,170
the open-source community

408
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,519
wait so why do I love free software

409
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,730
again because people say really nice

410
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,069
things to write why the do I write

411
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,019
free software because love is stronger

412
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,839
than hate and I love my free software

413
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,920
friends adult male hackers are elevated

414
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,660
to ten-year-old girls when someone

415
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,040
breaks out the free software computer

416
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,949
stickers yeah ten-year-old girls are

417
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:39,019
great I was one once

418
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,389
hey guys feel like playing solitaire

419
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,990
 the windows 1 and support this it's

420
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,079
really cool I didn't try it

421
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:52,459
 fact Vorbis is the bucks

422
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,350
thrown by users on Facebook iPad app I

423
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,149
just want to tell Facebook it just

424
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,740
put it on github and let us fix it I

425
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,779
think like this is an idea that drives

426
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,579
open-source a lot in general which is

427
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,459
like we can take care of things

428
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,480
holy they just made Swift

429
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,959
open-source Apple I know people

430
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,140
highlighting people who are excited when

431
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,449
things like align with these things I

432
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,849
fixed it I fix it you

433
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,760
Android I am your master I've been back

434
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,949
I've been to the darkest depths of Hell

435
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,679
and now I am back thank you

436
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,630
we now black block all IP addresses that

437
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,340
are located in Cuba Iran North Korea

438
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,679
Sudan and Syria it's a thing dr. docker

439
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
decided to start doing I believe it was

440
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,230
in compliance with a number of you

441
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,780
u.s. embargo standards and it's there's

442
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,360
something actually like particularly

443
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,250
inspiring about people being upset by

444
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,540
these decisions

445
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,320
Ubuntu first boot bout to be lit

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,470
 yeah and then there's some I don't

447
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,760
really know what to say about them I

448
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,559
don't know what hashtag Free Willy

449
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,919
oh noes up as free software hahaha

450
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,900
you SOPA means nor this I met a

451
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,100
developer asked him what he does and he

452
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,600
said that he does open-source what the

453
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,700
 is open-source freaking noob that

454
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,130
person is a noob why the should we

455
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,230
use an open source and free alternative

456
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,000
software we can an illegal copy over the

457
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,049
Internet of whatever we need well what

458
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,299
now what can Twitter do it turns out

459
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,919
that Twitter is really bad at enforcing

460
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,110
their policies and in fact Twitter has

461
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,510
policies and twitter has had policy

462
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,160
since before each of those tweets

463
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,850
existed now here are some specific

464
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,799
things they talk about you can check out

465
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,870
their like more in-depth commentary on

466
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,890
what they do you see I'm talking about

467
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,440
policies now they have content

468
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,169
boundaries abusive behavior and spam I

469
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,970
don't know if you're really on Twitter

470
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,040
but I get lots of like spam followers

471
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,490
and spam messages all the time I think

472
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,919
that if you look more in-depth into

473
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,620
things people have said both in like

474
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,390
broader context when we want to talk

475
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,110
about things like gamergate or like not

476
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,820
just trolling but threats of physical

477
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,690
violence

478
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,780
you know these things persist both in

479
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,510
terms of their existing and in terms of

480
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,950
people not getting rid of of this like

481
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,470
archeological technical like awful stuff

482
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,850
so a good question actually is who

483
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,830
should police our community alright good

484
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,350
know knows game not it last person to

485
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,260
the best I could do who if anyone should

486
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,030
police our community right so is it our

487
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,740
job to be talking to people about these

488
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,900
things should we expect to Twitter to

489
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,549
make these decisions on our behalf about

490
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,799
what is or isn't okay I don't have an

491
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,270
answer to this I think we should all

492
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,299
think about it so how do we talk in our

493
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,940
own spaces after I spent an amount of

494
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,020
time looking at how we're talking

495
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,570
publicly I was interested in how we talk

496
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,850
to ourselves and about ourselves

497
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,360
it's more than just the word oh

498
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,250
there's this Debian going around

499
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,990
trying to get everyone else to use free

500
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,289
software is the bad word there if

501
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,750
they did not mean like cigarettes

502
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,669
free software is apparently with

503
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,490
the FSF stands for I know lots of things

504
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,370
about open source suck a dick and I'll

505
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,990
explain why all these fit together soon

506
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,880
please oh yeah

507
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,200
please off and die in a big

508
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,210
chemical fire before I get there to beat

509
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,620
you I kind of like this one actually the

510
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,509
power of language extends beyond the

511
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:29,149
intentions extends beyond the intentions

512
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,490
behind words to the historical and

513
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,870
linguistic meaning of the words

514
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,269
themselves what does this mean this

515
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,090
means that the word has in a number

516
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,309
of ways to come entirely meaningless and

517
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,769
more specifically the word has

518
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:44,870
become entirely meaningless and it's

519
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,240
frequently just used as a generic insult

520
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,429
what it's actually doing when you call

521
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:50,960
someone a when you call someone a

522
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,389
 when you use gay as an insult you're

523
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:57,019
actually like alienating a decent part

524
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:57,919
of your community

525
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,289
there are people there who are upset who

526
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,480
feel unwelcome and who feel unable to

527
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,519
participate because this is language

528
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,690
people are using cursing can be fun so

529
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,759
we're you know I shouldn't I'm not

530
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,350
saying we shouldn't do it at all

531
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,360
but and some of these things don't have

532
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,580
to be bad words but is a bad

533
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,830
word I really like as an

534
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,320
example when talking like meta

535
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,669
linguistically b-corps about Medellin

536
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:26,990
meta conversations about logistics

537
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,049
because it's a really vile visceral way

538
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,350
to call someone gay as an insult and

539
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,389
actually if you think about it for like

540
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,610
a little bit what you realize is that

541
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,379
they're actually insulting everyone who

542
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:42,559
is sexually attracted to men turning

543
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,509
that into like a really bad thing to

544
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:47,509
basing people who are doing that so I

545
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,950
wanted to look at something else now and

546
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,509
I found the Linux kernel mailing list

547
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,710
because it seemed like a good idea at

548
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,230
the time the Linux kernel mailing this

549
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,970
is known for being an awful which is why

550
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,700
I thought it was a good idea so I

551
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,929
created a list of words that are

552
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,760
damaging in the same way and

553
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,519
 are and I compared them to you

554
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,849
of pre and post code of conduct on the

555
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:13,039
Linux kernel mailing list oh yeah yeah I

556
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,469
I'm so used to code of conduct they call

557
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,619
it a code of conflict actually and we're

558
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,479
gonna talk about that a little bit here

559
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,989
are some words for sexuality the this on

560
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:25,519
a lighter side the Linux kernel mailing

561
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,940
list over its lifespan since 1996 has

562
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,059
over two million messages so from that

563
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,709
these numbers are actually kind of

564
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,899
insignificant it turns out that also no

565
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,399
one calls each other a and

566
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,399
that's just an in-person conversation

567
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,690
tactic though they do use phrases like

568
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,489
suck a dick bag is really commonly used

569
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:49,219
sometimes this is like just linguistic

570
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,749
tendencies or slang within a community

571
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:54,379
if I get no one calls each other dykes

572
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,059
and like they're generally pretty okay

573
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,999
leaving lesbians like weaving lesbians

574
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,729
specifically alone unless they're

575
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,229
talking more about people who are

576
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:05,779
lesbians or a handful of messages where

577
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,779
it occurs a number of times homo is all

578
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,549
irrelevant because they were all talking

579
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,309
about like human like evolutionary

580
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,859
development I'm going to be using the PS

581
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,179
I'm going to be using the code for my

582
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,039
purpose so oh right that was so that was

583
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:24,320
one thing somebody said I'm gonna be

584
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,629
using code myself so slave away

585
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:31,369
 this is a lot the there was this

586
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,109
like wall there are these really long

587
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,749
posts specifically about system D so I

588
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,639
maintain at this point that system D is

589
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:45,229
a dirty word there's even more than that

590
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,869
people really love to call the Leonard a

591
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,679


592
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,039
I don't know why I'm like the fact that

593
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,499
he had to then express publicly or felt

594
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,869
the need to about his sexuality like

595
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,329
makes a comment about how people are

596
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,999
thinking about about homosexuality and

597
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,649
about gayness within free software and

598
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,609
technology in general but it's also like

599
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,589
this idea that he has to defend himself

600
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,809
personally defend in finger quotes

601
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,749
himself personally in this like public

602
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,730
context

603
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,570
this is more of that social justice

604
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,059
warrior is also a bad term these are

605
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,790
really long posts so just kind of bolded

606
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,650
things if you want to read these in

607
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,330
depth later I can send you the slides

608
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,280
this is more of that people wrote these

609
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,450
long emails good it well then it gets

610
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,400
kicked out of Debian by phat the

611
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,340
and enemies people take criticism of

612
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,610
their code very personally I have more

613
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,299
on it's great word so then

614
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,510
you know so this is more of that this is

615
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,890
describing things from a performance

616
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,630
angle so they're making technical

617
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,260
commentary about like using gayness as

618
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,790
an insult for technical performance so

619
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,530
there's also this category of people who

620
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,260
like decide to add these keywords at the

621
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,630
bottom of their posts and it includes

622
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,049
things

623
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,130
oh yeah that was like the one use of

624
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,700
homo inclues like like both terms that

625
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,250
might trigger the NSA somebody like

626
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,750
wrote another post explaining why they

627
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,150
did this but it also uses things like

628
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,919
pedophile lesbian to call those out and

629
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,450
this generally doesn't create welcoming

630
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,330
behavior because you're using more words

631
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,330
in either ways that are insulting or

632
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,309
ways that are meaningless and you're

633
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,860
really taking down somebody's self

634
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,679
identity as a lesbian by saying I'm

635
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,540
using this as a trigger to get people to

636
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,340
be mad at me

637
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,590
there's misogyny this is me twice if

638
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,700
it's not quite aware if you're in the

639
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,750
back of the room and you can't see this

640
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,059
when most people try to describe me one

641
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,290
of the terms they frequently use as a

642
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,890
woman is a woman so misogyny is near and

643
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,419
dear to my heart

644
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:06,290
 is one of the words trans so

645
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,990
out of that we're playing like

646
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,000
transsexual transgender trans woman

647
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,290
trans man and then feminist and feminism

648
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,179
they talk about feminists and feminism a

649
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:19,669
lot on Linux kernel mailing us but it is

650
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,570
also a dirty word porn span is a problem

651
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,309
as well so a number of these things turn

652
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:29,000
up like in spam messages from porn and

653
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,270
they still exist in the our

654
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,340
I would make the argument that people

655
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,840
who are archiving emails while there is

656
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,020
value to having extensive archives

657
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,059
you should still like actually get rid

658
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,559
of this stuff because when you're

659
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,770
searching through and obviously if I'm

660
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,870
looking for the word and like

661
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,970
at archive I know I'm gonna find things

662
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,780
I don't like

663
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,350
but seeing like specifically these these

664
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,289
like porn like spam mails with these

665
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,000
in-depth descriptions is actually not

666
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,039
what I'm looking for so I just found it

667
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,929
annoying one of the things here is they

668
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:07,150
define social justice warriors there's

669
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,220
this recurring theme where people

670
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,070
describe male feminists in this way as

671
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,409
though they are weak and that that's a

672
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:17,140
bad thing they also called women's

673
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,880
spinsters which isn't a term you hear a

674
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,150
lot anymore so this one particular

675
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,860
person who wrote this really in-depth

676
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,080
thing like mostly about systemd and

677
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,700
leonard who's apparently a social

678
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,960
justice warrior and male feminist I

679
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,590
don't know Leonard

680
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,650
I don't really know this like why don't

681
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,179
use the word spinster like I was really

682
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,620
impressed by their creative use of

683
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,190
language ongoing they define a woman as

684
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,130
a do-nothing

685
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,059
generally when people talk about

686
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,340
identification of women in terms of

687
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,669
their genitalia it's turning the like

688
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,440
value of a person into a sexual object

689
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,000
and then they use FEM it like they they

690
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,830
hit everything I was really like I just

691
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,350
appreciated it they also talked about

692
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,230
worthless women and like thinking that

693
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,240
women don't contribute to communities or

694
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,770
that their contributions aren't valuable

695
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,870
if you think back earlier to Twitter

696
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,210
when someone is talking about how it's

697
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,740
the only people who want a code of

698
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,750
conduct aren't people who contribute

699
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,570
code then you know you shouldn't have

700
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,710
this it's actually not valuable

701
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,809
important because those people aren't

702
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:21,809
important and valuable contributors

703
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,070
human won't hear even more feminist

704
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,940
 there are whatever and Nancy is

705
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,440
as another insult for men

706
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,460
I'd like really good use of language I

707
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,750
find politically correct stuff this is

708
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,610
someone else so tasteless that I'd

709
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,080
rather shake hands with a with

710
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,390
AIDS yes that was meant to be Clinic

711
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,250
politically incorrect then one of the

712
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,419
bible thumpers

713
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,840
with this somebody made a decision that

714
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,390
in spite of conversations going on about

715
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,060
how there is a need for policy because

716
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,310
this was after Sarah sharp said that

717
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,080
like you know the Linux kernel mailing

718
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,470
list needs a code of conduct people went

719
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,030
out of their way to really try to

720
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,950
trigger what was going on not just in

721
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,360
terms of their use of words but by

722
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
making it clear they were intentionally

723
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,610
using those words thunderbird is written

724
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,750
by aged horn monkeys stoned on crack

725
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,140
yeah and this is another really long one

726
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,320
also criticizing by someone else

727
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
criticizing the role of women in debian

728
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,820
and kind of the slant the debian

729
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,860
community has taken to try to make it

730
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,160
more inclusive in a number of ways it

731
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,960
goes on to talk about this there is

732
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,410
insults about a transgender person with

733
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,150
a strong implication that that is one of

734
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,280
the problems with them and problems with

735
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,230
the people they live with who also

736
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,780
identify as trans and intersex they make

737
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,580
fun of the outreach program they also

738
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,440
talk about system D more because

739
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,620
everyone hates system D and then they

740
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,260
they like later on pull out feminists

741
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,780
again as an insult this time in

742
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,300
reference to women rather than men

743
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,710
feminists is a dirty word within the

744
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,900
Linux kernel community or at least was

745
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,640
for a long time and I would make the

746
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,500
argument that in the greater open source

747
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,540
and free software community it is still

748
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,680
frequently treated as a dirty word more

749
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,880
male space space again feminism but do

750
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,850
you hate feminism oh but hating it that

751
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,860
if you write free software release free

752
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,040
media and of every type and in quantity

753
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,770
but hate feminism you're a plague on the

754
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,020
open-source community this is an ongoing

755
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,670
conversation that people should have

756
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,240
when they're actually discussing whether

757
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,660
or not you're trying to create a product

758
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
as quickly as possible regardless of its

759
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,370
functionality the cleanness of its code

760
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,430
or or the like the overall usability of

761
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,430
it or you want to kind of construct this

762
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,620
this space of contributors in the space

763
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,400
of people

764
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,250
and what that requires is creating

765
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,800
spaces where people are welcome and

766
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,809
we'll talk about that a little bit

767
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,590
feminists need to be thrown out of

768
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,480
kernel development like how they through

769
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,070
anti-feminist men out of debian and

770
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,100
other linux distro development the

771
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,320
feminist software foundation that was

772
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,000
also meant to be a bad thing but I would

773
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,470
I would be super into the feminist

774
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:39,550
Software Foundation try to go but yeah I

775
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,400
believe that that was the name of their

776
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,580
company stuff their foundation yeah I

777
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,920
don't remember I remember I haven't like

778
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,840
I have that and I have that actual thing

779
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,940
in my file of like data somewhere and

780
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,770
later on I can dig it up and check I

781
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,980
don't remember

782
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,890
so this one is someone saying dude I'm

783
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,929
not on a horse here I'm not asking you

784
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,390
to change your communication styles in

785
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,130
order to help minorities I'm not some

786
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,440
crazy feminist ranting about booties on

787
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,550
Google+ this made me sad when I read it

788
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,920
it was written by somebody who I think I

789
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,809
believe self identifies as a feminist

790
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,120
somebody who has done a lot of work to

791
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,309
create inclusive and diverse communities

792
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,830
and they send us about themselves so

793
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,720
they were distancing themselves from the

794
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,090
concept of feminism within the Linux

795
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,800
kernel community and they made it clear

796
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,320
that like like they it was very

797
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,330
apologetic in its nature of calling

798
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,090
someone out on their behavior now here's

799
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,770
some stuff on racism cuz we're also

800
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,870
racist I don't know how to write this

801
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,260
slide either ah there are there's a

802
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,809
variable that I searched for and I got

803
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,410
some results and some highlights are no

804
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,300
one was born to act and behave like a

805
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,090
nodding I thought that in front of you

806
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,559
if you don't want to take it like that

807
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,490
well you're strictly obsolete man that

808
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,200
it disgusts me to no end that the

809
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,190
bleeding of scaried carried sheep is so

810
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,440
prominent in America

811
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,810
the new wave of patriotism like the hand

812
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,130
of your master and praise him for

813
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,720
beating someone other than you the house

814
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,220
mentality alive and well now in every

815
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,340
race and Creed I also looked up these

816
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,530
two people they're both white and like

817
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,170
talking especially in a community that

818
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,200
is so white and has such problems with

819
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,900
racial diversity like using that

820
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,450
language not just as commentary and not

821
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,000
just as an insult but by contextualizing

822
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,460
it in like awful institutional

823
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,590
discrimination is like it pains me oh

824
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:54,600
but no one said anything about Jews so

825
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,910
does this actually matter right as of

826
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,700
last night there were two million six

827
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,860
hundred forty one thousand two hundred

828
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,300
four messages in the Linux kernel

829
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,520
archives which lasts from 1996 to 2017

830
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,659
there's also a post from 1910 I was very

831
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,659
impressed with them to contextualize a

832
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,310
little bit about what the how big that

833
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,380
number is is it's almost as big as the

834
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,030
city of Rome

835
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,330
it's bigger than Paris and it's more

836
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,860
than twice the size of the entire

837
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,390
population of Brussels

838
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,130
so because of when I was looking at this

839
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,350
I pulled my most recent data from

840
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:38,340
November of 2016 and I had 115 messages

841
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,889
total at the time there were two million

842
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,600
five hundred seventy seven thousand

843
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,880
seven hundred two messages on the

844
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,400
mailing list when I tried to make a

845
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,250
chart of like how small 115 is compared

846
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,650
to 2.5 2.6 million it was unreadable and

847
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,370
how tiny 1.1 115 is so this is really

848
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,370
the minority of things people are saying

849
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,600
yeah but they've some of the biggest

850
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,680
things and there's some other things

851
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,480
that get pressed and these are the ways

852
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,720
that we are like presenting ourselves as

853
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,370
like to the rest of the world so now

854
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,300
we're going to talk about codes of

855
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,430
conduct for

856
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,520
a little bit it's pronounced COC not

857
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,900
talk just to clear up confusion the Lynx

858
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,339
kernel mailing list merged a code of

859
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,059
conduct in early March of 2015 there are

860
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,150
code of conflict sorry this was this was

861
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,059
very divisive and contentious ultimately

862
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:43,849
lineThe emerged in himself which was

863
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:45,530
considered a triumph by a number of

864
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,460
people in the community did this here's

865
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,650
some things from the code of conflict

866
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,589
itself your code and ideas behind it

867
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,059
will be carefully reviewed often

868
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:58,670
resulting in critique and criticism know

869
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,140
that this happens because everybody

870
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,790
involved wants to see the best possible

871
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,640
solution the development process has

872
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,290
been proven to create some of the most

873
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,849
robot to create the most robust

874
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,990
operating system kernel ever you go we

875
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,300
do not want to do anything to cause the

876
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,790
quality of submission and eventual

877
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,880
results to decrease your thinking about

878
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,140
your project in a long term your with

879
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,420
this really not thinking about it in a

880
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,950
long term you're thinking about it in

881
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,630
terms of the immediate results of what

882
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,970
somebody is submitting and creating in a

883
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,950
given moment rather than what your

884
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,440
community is doing and can succeed at

885
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,440
over time diversity and inclusivity is

886
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,780
invaluable and necessary for communities

887
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,640
to be successful because you need a

888
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,130
variety of experiences and knowledge in

889
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,720
order to create things that are robust

890
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,579
and in order to create things that can

891
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:53,210
last for a long time more on the code of

892
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,390
conflict personally abused threatened or

893
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,790
otherwise uncomfortable do the process

894
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,780
people who are made to feel this way

895
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,359
it's not acceptable please contact the

896
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:04,190
Linux foundation's technical advisory

897
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,589
board they will work to resolve the

898
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,930
issue something that's can guess five

899
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,950
minutes Oh something that's considered a

900
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,869
kind of like a bad part of codes of

901
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,549
conduct and anti harassment policies is

902
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,200
when people are skipping over these

903
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,630
kinds of things like not making it clear

904
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,640
how you can like who you can talk to

905
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,010
like really D personalizing who you can

906
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,099
talk to and like this entire thing this

907
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,420
entire code of conflict to be a little

908
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,250
critical of it not that I haven't been

909
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,380
critical of it already is that it's

910
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,660
focusing on not the individual

911
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,460
but the concept of who they are their

912
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,089
value as developers

913
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,349
please strive to keep things simple and

914
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:44,780
focused on technical issues be excellent

915
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,430
to each other did this help kind of so

916
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,510
looking at the post COC results a number

917
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,829
of the words that I searched for

918
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:57,650
originally actually didn't show up again

919
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,660
and but they hadn't shown up again for a

920
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,670
long time I think lesbian was actually

921
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,380
2014 but the word was last posted

922
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,720
in February of 2015

923
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,030
March was at the beginning of March was

924
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,190
when the code of conflict was added to

925
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,319
like the Linux kernel community and

926
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,750
operating procedures feminist slash

927
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,490
showed up in February of 2015 so

928
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,980
apparently the Linux kernel medallist

929
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,859
also thanks feminists is a bad word so

930
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,000
people stop saying and feminists

931
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,819
do these people matter yes the total

932
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,950
usage of the word before the code

933
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,079
of conduct over the course of Nordics

934
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,410
chrome Ellis was 893 since March it's

935
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,270
gone down significantly

936
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,630
someone said once in 2015 and there

937
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,029
were 79 journalist so that's also come

938
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:50,049
down people said please and thanks less

939
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,039
after the code of conflict was

940
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,160
instituted one possible theory on this

941
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,700
is that the focus of the conversation

942
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,920
was much more technical as opposed to

943
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,950
like dealing with community issues

944
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,819
before the code of conflict was

945
00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:06,710
instituted people went a lot more out of

946
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,970
their way to thank each other for

947
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,940
contributions and footwork do you

948
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,410
 and feminists matter because we

949
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,799
insult them yes so even though it's only

950
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:18,260
a few cases like we still shouldn't be

951
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,170
doing this and codes of conflict like

952
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,000
need to be thought about many as we

953
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,160
thought about back to behavior Freddie

954
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,829
that's really quick behavioral

955
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:29,180
guidelines are things we have we have

956
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,400
codes of conduct at conferences we have

957
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,380
anti harassment policies do they help

958
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,960
nope they help a little bit here are

959
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,079
some examples post events instituting

960
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,720
codes of conduct this is only a few of

961
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,750
the ones I found offs Khan had pervasive

962
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,410
sexual attention on a

963
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,049
munity remember chaos communication

964
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:50,940
congress instituted a gender-neutral

965
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,460
bathroom policy to try to make people

966
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,470
who didn't identify within a gender

967
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,380
binary more uncomfortable nonetheless

968
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,119
attendees who do not identify within the

969
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,559
gender binary we're still harassed in

970
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,660
bathrooms context is a science-fiction

971
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,510
convention that was ineffective in a

972
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,880
number of ways after the Apollo after

973
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,170
their anti harassment policy was

974
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,030
introduced science fiction matters to us

975
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,230
because there's a lot of overlap between

976
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,890
the two communities at ISC - a woman was

977
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,690
drugged - after the Code of Ethics was

978
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,309
instituted in 2015

979
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:24,240
etc etc a geek geek feminism has a

980
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,970
timeline of total incidents reported at

981
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,039
various Keuka vents it increases over

982
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,930
time um this could be done for many

983
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,579
reasons more women are going to events

984
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,130
and more people feel more but

985
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,470
theoretically I believe more people feel

986
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,670
more privileged within these communities

987
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,500
and though as though that behavior is

988
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,650
acceptable codes of conduct are becoming

989
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,500
more common which actually helps and

990
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,569
there are some successes not everything

991
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,730
sucks all the time attendees have been

992
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,109
removed from events and people have been

993
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,819
banned from events for things that

994
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,230
they've done in the community even

995
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,599
outside of the event itself with this

996
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,059
goal and hope of creating safe spaces

997
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,440
there are more codes of conduct FOSDEM

998
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,839
in its wonderful way when it was asked

999
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,460
about the lack of code of conduct very

1000
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,980
quickly created one and this is creating

1001
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,000
an institutional norm so these the codes

1002
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,319
of conduct are really important because

1003
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,089
what they're doing is they're letting

1004
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:18,270
people know that the community and

1005
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,260
especially the people organizing

1006
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,480
something the moderators on a list or

1007
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,950
forum or the people running the

1008
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,529
conference actually care about them care

1009
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:27,119
about creating these spaces where they

1010
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,839
can be and trying to put effort into

1011
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,020
doing better here's a call to action

1012
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,640
these are things that we can do to help

1013
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,770
each other you should tell your stories

1014
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,059
and you should tell your event stories

1015
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,760
this is either if you feel comfortable

1016
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,410
sharing specific things that happen to

1017
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,480
you especially men who feel as though

1018
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,190
negative things have happened to them

1019
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,569
because obviously women sharing these

1020
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:49,890
things is only making so much of a

1021
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,510
difference so it's time for privileged

1022
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,799
men to step up and share their

1023
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:54,420
experiences as well

1024
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,069
because then the people doing awful

1025
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:58,410
things can like connect with you more

1026
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,190
we're much more inclined to

1027
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,020
feel connected and to share ideas and be

1028
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,790
comfortable around people who look like

1029
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,329
us

1030
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:06,310
tell your event stories so in the same

1031
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,319
way but I also really want people to

1032
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,770
share more data about like things that

1033
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,480
happen at their conferences so so like

1034
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,240
share a number of incidents reported you

1035
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,500
know don't do you know do this in an

1036
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,660
anonymized way but having numbers on

1037
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,369
that would be really useful when we're

1038
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:22,900
looking at instituting policies when

1039
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,310
we're trying to make arguments to people

1040
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,160
who value statistics and data that they

1041
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,020
should be doing these things and enforce

1042
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,310
policies

1043
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,950
unless you're enforcing a policy nothing

1044
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,420
it's useless it's not making any

1045
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,089
difference because there are no negative

1046
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:39,940
repercussions so I still love free

1047
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,910
software inside of all of this and if

1048
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,050
anyone has any questions that we have

1049
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:48,099
anytime that's my cat yeah my cat's name

1050
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,970
is bat he's adorable

1051
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,950
thanks I was wondering if you felt that

1052
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,510
the adoption of codes of conduct has

1053
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,700
created an environment where people feel

1054
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,619
safer reporting them and that could

1055
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,450
explain the increase in incidence I

1056
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,740
think so I have thought about that and I

1057
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,260
think that is partially true I think

1058
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,579
things like like the Linux kernel

1059
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,050
mailing was because of conflict and the

1060
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,849
code of ethics from LA ILC whatever that

1061
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,910
was don't do a really good job at

1062
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,589
talking about who you should talk with

1063
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:26,349
at create it I like saying to someone

1064
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,089
you should email someone else is is

1065
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,859
really removing it from the situation

1066
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,510
and it's good to have the option to

1067
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,099
email someone but when that's your only

1068
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,430
like point of recourse like that's not

1069
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,079
the best thing to do Sarah sharp now

1070
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,390
does event and community incident

1071
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,420
training and response and in it there's

1072
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,099
a lot of stuff about like clearly

1073
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,079
identifying people making sure that your

1074
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:48,460
list of people to talk with is very

1075
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,790
diverse so that somebody can hopefully

1076
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,710
find someone who looks like them or who

1077
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,910
they'll be comfortable around and

1078
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,839
creating these spaces to talk

1079
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:07,340
anything else okay awesome thanks Molly

1080
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:15,769
