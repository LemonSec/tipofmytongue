1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,410
welcome thanks for joining and nice that

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:08,980
you're here

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm Malta and we started the

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,660
presentation and we will have time for

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,360
questions anytime you want but also at

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,750
the end we cannot we can go through any

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,580
details I will be happy to answer your

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,349
questions

9
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,859
compared to the top before this is more

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:30,400
like a theoretical thought experiment

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,250
about what maps actually are or what do

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,160
we understand as Geographic what maps

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,420
but in the second part I will also

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,850
present a kind of implementation

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,260
experimental implementation on how we

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,539
can publish these kinds of new web Maps

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,640
so first I want to shortly start about

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,350
the perspective does anyone know what

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,250
semantic annotations basically are cool

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,150
would you tell it

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,200
exactly yeah exactly so and the for

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,140
example that yeah so the answer was it's

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,630
basically metadata on an object and to

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,119
store various attributes right what you

25
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,450
say exact and people use it on a web for

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,670
example through you our eyes Uniform

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,090
Resource identifiers so and this your

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,310
eyes refer to well defined terms and

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,380
concepts describing the world from a

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,789
specific domain and we use it to

31
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,800
contextualize data and give it kind of

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,450
meaning so machines can interpret it

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,240
better and decode the data successfully

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,600
so my perspectives more about mapmakers

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,009
there's actually a working group is

36
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,440
called it was the open invitation group

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,119
which joined now is a w3c web annotation

38
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,489
group this is a kind of annotation from

39
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,350
a reader's perspective if you're

40
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,780
confronted with a web map but the reader

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,880
you want to annotate it this kind of a

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,010
federal federated architecture for

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,190
annotations my focus is on people who

44
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,130
create maps using these tools to to

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,959
create these annotations in advance for

46
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,510
their readers so just to make clear that

47
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,630
the perspectives here about a different

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,400
creation of mapping documents so yes my

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,440
my assumption is that basically when we

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,049
have complex visualizations such as

51
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,730
Geographic work maps with if they would

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,810
be annotated we would be supported in in

53
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,370
more effectively reading what the

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,160
visualization is about and maybe what is

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,739
also hidden through the visualization

56
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,060
but actually contained in the

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,530
information which informed the

58
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,850
visualization so I think there's kind of

59
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,160
the potential yet not yet tapped for for

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,380
semantic technologies also to to

61
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,560
facilitate human communication on based

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,739
on these artifacts like maps so turning

63
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,720
any information to a statement like if

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
somebody says that there's a house

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,180
we have this kind of

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,220
it's a bit complicated because someone

67
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,129
said there is a house or there is

68
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,299
something which we could call

69
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,290
structure and we have kind of the WHO

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,020
and the where the coordinates the the

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,210
something maybe there's an individual

72
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,640
entity representing this house for

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,950
example this university is kind of a

74
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,600
defined concept the University of

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,820
liberal Brussels and it maybe exists in

76
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,650
many databases for example we can't ADA

77
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,020
or dbpedia and if you if you manage to

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,140
map to create maps which already

79
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,060
reference this item then you it can

80
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,760
interlink use maps to interlink many

81
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,490
data sources and then we would have also

82
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,020
the label in English language we would

83
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,750
could be could be a structure of for the

84
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,060
society how the Civic structure like I

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,140
don't know how to translate it better

86
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,260
basically we can look in the definition

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,669
it's more more abstract term for a house

88
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,140
and furthermore to attach to the saucer

89
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,660
many other attributes which annotate

90
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,190
kind of on these levels for example

91
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,410
sources often an organization or person

92
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,720
like there many vocabularies to describe

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,640
this so yeah if we talk about the

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,850
mannequin taking some maps we I decided

95
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,680
to use the schema.org vocabulary because

96
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,419
it's kind of a no cab you Larry which

97
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,729
allows that or tries to describe

98
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,550
everyday concert everyday life concepts

99
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,210
like terms which which we use in

100
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,270
everyday life and there are five up very

101
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,800
abstract entities for example

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,450
organizations basically anything which

103
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,450
is kind of from university to business

104
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,900
to accountant all kinds of companies and

105
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,020
it's a very hierarchical taxonomy about

106
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,180
how to describe the world creative work

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,010
there are book articles media files

108
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,550
intangible is something which has no

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,190
material existence event is also you

110
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,590
know like an event and the place we can

111
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,539
we can look at it look it up I wanted to

112
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,550
click here and

113
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,910
see some examples if you have never been

114
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,680
seen schema.org

115
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,250
it is a public vocabulary developed by a

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,540
consortium of major search engine

117
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,740
developers and they use it to describe

118
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,930
data on the web so the Google knowledge

119
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,600
graph is also understands this

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:21,850
vocabulary but we will see here this

121
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:31,310
excuse me so here we have the hierarchy

122
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,600
for example of places a civic structure

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,580
may be an airport aquarium beach bus

124
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,770
station campground cemetery event etc

125
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,410
etc and we can say for example event

126
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,380
venue has the geolocation and or let's

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,990
make another example for example these

128
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,210
are the relations which describe how the

129
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,410
building relates to the geographic

130
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,550
reference values so we say if if I use

131
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,440
an organization and I have geo data on

132
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,260
it the area surf property is is there to

133
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,320
express that the geographic

134
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
representation for example the geometry

135
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,940
represents the area served by this

136
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,140
organization or a birthplace is an

137
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,730
attribute of a person for example you

138
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,230
want to say this Geographic and

139
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,730
reference value is the birthplace of a

140
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,990
person and drop-off location is actually

141
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,690
a bus stop for example so you can do

142
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,050
coordinate and put it in relation to

143
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,250
kind of a civic structure like a bus

144
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,350
stop and say this coordinates tends to

145
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,020
the content in relation as of drop-off

146
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,780
location and there are some generics

147
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,050
like geo where which don't specify a

148
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,210
specific relation between the content

149
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,810
and the geographical representation and

150
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,500
yeah this is also in the repo and this

151
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,260
is just to tell you about what kind of

152
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,849
annotations or statements I want

153
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,610
mapmakers to make about the world so if

154
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,990
you make a map you implicitly making

155
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,699
these statements but if you use this

156
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,009
vocabulary to make these statements you

157
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,610
have a well-defined meaning and you can

158
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,800
publish this information machine

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,389
interchangeable and application

160
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,369
interchangeable so you can reuse this

161
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,419
information not only in the

162
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,669
visualization but also in other things I

163
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:44,449
will show some examples yeah no okay

164
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,519
it's not spatial hierarchy but topical

165
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,769
hierarchy so the schema I mean there's

166
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,449
kind of a class name there the Institute

167
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,120
is what the relations between the

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,970
Institute and the University is probably

169
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,110
the institution is a part of the

170
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,949
university but the Institute is also

171
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:06,519
independent of the University so

172
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,750
building in a building where it's

173
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,250
probably easy because we can always

174
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,380
refer to like the spatial structure

175
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,860
between that day one big thing is is if

176
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,319
we have the area of the University we

177
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:20,449
can also say and this includes all other

178
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,209
sports we can still interpolate and say

179
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,680
okay this institute is part of the

180
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,319
building so in spatial reasoning is more

181
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,870
simple to aggregate this but in topical

182
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,430
reasoning we actually would have to need

183
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,639
to express the relation between an

184
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,259
Institute and the University and this is

185
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,810
kind of a complex relation times it's

186
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,509
not easy to describe because they are

187
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,430
also acting on their own it's not that

188
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,259
the university is the umbrella for

189
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,319
everything so this is I just meant the

190
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,180
schema Dorcas iraq agree that it may

191
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,490
allow us to very abstract

192
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,689
classifications but also those very

193
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,459
concrete classifications and it is a

194
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,149
kind of hierarchy nina okay there's a

195
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,670
long x course for the first two slides i

196
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,730
have to pick up and get to some examples

197
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,600
sorry for if it was a bit theoretical

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,670
let's get started with the next chapter

199
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,440
so

200
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,050
yeah we talked about this kind of

201
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,130
statements we want to make and this is

202
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,130
kind of an example format web map how

203
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,960
it's may be technically seen for

204
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,550
technicals we have a model of the words

205
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,890
you did right and we have kind of a

206
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,530
protection layer which we now do to base

207
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,540
maps or base layer so call which we use

208
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,720
and I'm just concerned with annotations

209
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,330
of all the overlays so it's an

210
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,980
interesting future we work on how for

211
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,350
example he's the schema ontology or

212
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,750
vocabulary relates to osm tax for

213
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,010
example because this is on the base

214
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,380
layer and this could be matched or

215
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,570
aligned to each other but I'm basically

216
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,140
just wanted to allow the map makers to

217
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,530
express describe the content in the

218
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,660
overlays and this is also the focus of

219
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,740
the implementation in leaflet so I

220
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,250
needed to find the term for for the web

221
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,870
mapping document is a central concept

222
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,050
for me because I also wanted to see the

223
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,860
graphic web map as if it weren't a

224
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,990
visualization but if it were a list and

225
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,410
I could sort it I could explore it kind

226
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,330
of actually different attributes and I

227
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,700
work at the Department of cartography

228
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,220
and some people really don't understand

229
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,250
my computer scientist approach that I

230
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,410
want to get rid of the visualization and

231
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,960
just we text a kind of way because it's

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,390
the less ambitious way to describe the

233
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,980
world for me and yeah so web McEwen

234
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,210
document is basically trying to

235
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,610
decompose and a map into a list of

236
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,700
elements it needs to be standard conform

237
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,300
and machine readable the idea is to

238
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,980
reduce the complexity and just engage

239
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,140
with certain parts of the map so I can

240
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,740
analyze it and it may be used to

241
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,040
snapshot or map this is also coming from

242
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,510
a research project where we study

243
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,790
participatory maps which change often

244
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,260
over time and have a lot of different

245
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,660
authors in it I will show an example in

246
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,630
a minute and this is how to like archive

247
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,020
even or probe there's no possibility for

248
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,880
programmatic reasoning reasoning about

249
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
this kind of collections

250
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,940
and yeah if if we develop such a model

251
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,330
of a web mapping document this would

252
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,190
allow us to develop interactions for

253
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,470
maps which are reusable across all kinds

254
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,970
of maps it's kind of an application

255
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,580
developer approach before and you can

256
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,620
write user interfaces for it I need to

257
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,420
Moeller the map and that's kind of the

258
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,070
idea behind the web mapping document

259
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,820
this is kind of a web map which is a

260
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,959
good example because it's just

261
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,260
visualization and behind this is a real

262
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,540
database and you could also engage with

263
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,140
the data in a different perspective but

264
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,140
this map has a lot of different content

265
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,620
types from ideas to problem descriptions

266
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,060
and each kind of bubble is also a

267
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,080
different author behind it

268
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,390
so this kind of a very complex

269
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,320
information amount of information is

270
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,730
very complex aggregated in this

271
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,370
visualization and and the website also

272
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,920
provides the means to engage about the

273
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,599
ideas people have about the city

274
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,120
it's a opens yeah they try to engage

275
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,650
citizens of the city of Hamburg who

276
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,290
engage in ideas and exchange ideas about

277
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,140
how to improve the city and they also

278
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,000
have alternative visualizations for the

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,650
same data so it's to not just only the

280
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,770
math but there are lots of mapping

281
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,990
applications built nowaday like Cacho or

282
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,110
map box where they just collect

283
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,959
information in maps but it is not

284
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,820
accessible anywhere else or anywhere

285
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,680
else so I hope to also to approach these

286
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,360
companies with these free free software

287
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,990
from leaflet to to enable their users to

288
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,350
publish maps also machine readable and

289
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,380
exposed for other application developers

290
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,740
so I had to study a bit HTML and how to

291
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,940
express content of multiple authors in

292
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,230
one document I am i investigated some

293
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,900
terms and these are basically all the

294
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,820
alt up

295
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,070
and these are all the texts which which

296
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,110
actually allow for structuring the

297
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,300
content from depending on that there are

298
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,570
many authors I decided to go for a mix

299
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,280
of articles and address so because of

300
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,320
the content in the article now

301
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,160
describing about map elements or element

302
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,140
should be independently and reusable of

303
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,170
the map in it it is in it is it is used

304
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,930
in one example of such a content this is

305
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,140
a map of a festival I made and this is

306
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,980
all like all this represents an artist

307
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,610
and the band with a concrete track and

308
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,830
if the publisher of this map which is

309
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,770
occasionally me also knew about semantic

310
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,690
annotations for map map so I could like

311
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,910
open this map in my VLC or use it

312
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,190
somewhere else or save it as a playlist

313
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,920
and do something else with it so it's an

314
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,530
example where the whereas people spend

315
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,630
much time organizing information in maps

316
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,480
but then it's kind of lost in it and I

317
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
see it kind of as a practice like a

318
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,120
information organization practice that

319
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,630
people start to you to do it's somewhat

320
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,280
happened that we start to organize also

321
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,700
information and maps so my approaches or

322
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,440
my hope is to contribute to a document

323
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,350
format which makes it a more easier more

324
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,650
reusable so what is a web map element as

325
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,960
I said if we want to have a list of web

326
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,060
map elements if we want to see the map

327
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,710
as a list of elements we have to define

328
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,110
what is an element and this is kind of

329
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,760
my definition is similar to a point of

330
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,980
interest but can also include areas it's

331
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,890
not specific about locations and it's

332
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,790
basically everything you overlay a map

333
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,100
and specifically about my understanding

334
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,710
is that a web map element is both

335
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,200
together the Geographic present a

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,510
representation like the geo data used in

337
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,330
it for example on a polygon or a point

338
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,780
location plus the content just the

339
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,550
content description which actually is

340
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,480
represented by this geographic

341
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,240
information but together make a web map

342
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,440
element and both are kind of as I said

343
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,300
statements about the author boat from

344
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,900
from

345
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:01,800
individuals and if if we if we tend if

346
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,939
we start to see web map elements as

347
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,890
distinct items we can connect these

348
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,380
information or elements to the spatial

349
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,959
index of the web which is not yet

350
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,260
possible if we annotate them we can also

351
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,660
show selected information on a specific

352
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,559
web map element only monitor users and

353
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,650
we also may be which is not yet like I

354
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,140
have no evidence for but there

355
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,240
theoretically this kind of maps should

356
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,640
be indexed by major search engines and

357
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,510
we could actually find maps through a

358
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,330
topical description of one element like

359
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,480
we can see what kind of geo data someone

360
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,340
used to represent this content in which

361
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,920
map right so it makes a different it

362
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,679
makes them open up for for public

363
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,390
research yeah so that's it was short

364
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,280
this presenter vocabulary I used so this

365
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,690
is basically the schema.org vocabulary

366
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,290
to describe web map element and this is

367
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,170
a relation I explained in the beginning

368
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,510
so I in which relation does this content

369
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,330
stand to the geographic data and this is

370
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,790
basically the notation for the

371
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,870
geographic data and this is a scheme of

372
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,670
vocabulary and this is all dublin core

373
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,550
vocabulary dublin core is kind of an old

374
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,520
establish metadata standard to annotate

375
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,770
any kind of information resource so it

376
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,600
just contains very basic terms to

377
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,380
describe data sets or data entries and

378
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,400
oh I should have exchanged so for the

379
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,559
yeah so this is kind of overall is the

380
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,679
the 20 terms or so which I proposed to

381
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,809
annotate about map element with in text

382
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,880
form again and yeah so I also wanted to

383
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,340
make an implementation and I think this

384
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,660
is the next slide so I will now go in

385
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
into the practical details five minutes

386
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,700
ya have five minutes left before we can

387
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,320
open up for questions so

388
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,530
this is a standard leaflet example of a

389
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,140
marker and it's basically an image tag

390
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,800
with the resource so it isn't really not

391
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,950
know meaning is document about there's

392
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,690
no spatial reference is exposed

393
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,000
there's no topic of classification even

394
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,740
if there is a title the title is I think

395
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,120
it's not even in here because it's

396
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,830
another layer so it's hard to make to

397
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,150
guess something and which is totally

398
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,440
fine because leaflet was not made for

399
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,750
this and HTML also was not made for this

400
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,480
I don't want to be to be misunderstood

401
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,280
this is I just chose leaflet to

402
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,600
implement because it's very easy to

403
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,870
extend and a lot of people use it and so

404
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,170
there's a potential that a lot of people

405
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,720
can just change the HTML output if they

406
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,770
install my plugin and this is a map

407
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,980
where we see one thing so my plugin

408
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,360
contains two components it's not really

409
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,730
well illustrated but the one component

410
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,280
is to generate the new kind of HTML

411
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,620
model and the other component is kind of

412
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,270
a first example of a leaflet control

413
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,790
which engages and operates on this model

414
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,160
and here for example we have a full-text

415
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,920
search through the HTML and when I

416
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,630
select an item I can control the

417
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,210
viewport of the of the HTML this is kind

418
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,280
of possible we can build this kind of

419
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,810
controls with the new model of the map

420
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,660
and actually have kind of an ecosystem

421
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,300
of map interaction dialogues which work

422
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
on every map which which implements this

423
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,230
model so there is an example of my map

424
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,240
and structured data tool for for give

425
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,990
quick demo before I jump into there

426
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,010
let's let's see how it works

427
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,980
so this is basically for net public

428
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,670
sculptures no photographs of pub expired

429
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,010
scratches it's not described as

430
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,660
themselves represented in the map yet

431
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,750
but the photographs from the wiki data

432
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,180
database and as you see you cannot

433
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,750
really read anything here there's no

434
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,830
information because it's hard the labels

435
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,140
would overlap on stuff like this but now

436
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,620
I can use the leaflet control and say

437
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,580
can I find the hump of Oscar Wilde it's

438
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,770
in the shale appears in the in the

439
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,740
famous Cemetery in Paris Center and I

440
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,950
can so this interaction this click here

441
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,570
actually gets the spatial data from the

442
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,970
HTML has no relation to the leaflet run

443
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,370
time so it really extracts the the

444
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,940
references from the Dom and this is kind

445
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,500
of the dialogue for the metadata and I

446
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,340
also see this this data set comes from

447
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,960
this element this web map element is

448
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,950
actually a wikimedia file which is

449
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,130
associated from vicki data so this is

450
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,920
kind of a map where i went this far that

451
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,420
each element has a uri

452
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,520
for the entry in the vicki data database

453
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,920
so it's an internal map with a which

454
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,170
just interlinks other databases so this

455
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,160
is one example of where i see our now i

456
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,690
can read these are for nets were

457
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,880
photographs in this map i thought before

458
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,380
that i couldn't find out what is this

459
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,030
map about but now i see the description

460
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,630
of the map itself tells me this is a map

461
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,240
about photographs and another example is

462
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,050
here for example in this map I see two

463
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,160
to creative works one city one person

464
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,730
one organization and two countries which

465
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,490
is actually not true but it doesn't make

466
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,110
sense it's no problem when you have

467
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,690
multi polygons it tends to be counted as

468
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,520
many countries but since they all have

469
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,070
one identifier you can interpolate and

470
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,050
say this is just a bargain in the

471
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,220
software and over anyway

472
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,060
I say for example the creative work is

473
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,880
the user is an overlay so we can

474
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,650
actually also load images onto a pile of

475
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,010
other base layers and start to imitate

476
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,140
them and this is now expressed as a

477
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,390
bounding box in HTML and I can now this

478
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,550
a historical map of the same area right

479
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,220
I will check out the HTML here

480
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,430
so yeah here we see I make it a bit

481
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:49,370
bigger moment

482
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,450
so this is represented by an article

483
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,139
it's an article of type creative work

484
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:12,809
and the the location it depicts so this

485
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,309
is a special relation the content

486
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:17,070
location means is a relation to express

487
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,799
that this article depicts this area

488
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,379
which is of type Geographic shape and

489
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,799
now there comes blood I think with a oh

490
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,340
yeah no this is just a bounding box it's

491
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,610
not so much I mean if the polygon of a

492
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,730
you say is probably 80 pages long so it

493
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,330
really is a lot of data and yeah but

494
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,509
this way we can actually find at these

495
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:43,830
elements to the spatial index of the

496
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,799
worldwide web and just a short example

497
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:54,779
of how how leaflet annotate works as I'm

498
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,240
running out of time a few examples

499
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:15,590
maybe no times up so now we have time

500
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,629
for five five five minutes for questions

501
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:26,450
oh okay anyone has any special questions

502
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,970
about the leaflet API it's leave the

503
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,919
tenet eight the plugin it's on github

504
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,950
and you can now start to annotate

505
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,409
markers overlays soccer markers and

506
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:41,809
pop-ups with using schema.org sorry for

507
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:52,629
yeah please the what kind of schema yeah

508
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:55,879
no it's a it's a it's another taxonomy

509
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:59,149
another vocabulary and this could be the

510
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:01,340
schema.org vocabulary has a specific

511
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,200
purpose and those Ambika has specific

512
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,179
purpose and we could research into a

513
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,340
mapping it's just one time we need to

514
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,619
align certain things and but it would be

515
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,570
interchangeable so the question was if

516
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,720
if I'm reinventing OSM tags but I see it

517
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,419
it's a freeze free a free form text

518
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:18,109
follow me

519
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,269
so in schema.org is a controlled

520
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:23,960
vocabulary so we could actually benefit

521
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,350
if we align these two vocabularies and

522
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,080
this needs to be done just once or yeah

523
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,970
whenever one one or the other changes

524
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,169
but it's nothing I understand as a I'm

525
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,239
not trying to invent this I'm just using

526
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,859
the schema.org because the search

527
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:44,600
engines understand it right mmm one more

528
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,850
question okay yep

529
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,260
thanks for your attention sorry

530
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,320
you
