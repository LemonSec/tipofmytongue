1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,620
good afternoon everybody welcome our

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,179
next speaker is Hugo talbo to talk about

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,610
simulation open framework architecture

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:23,420
give them a big hand please thank you

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,130
very much for for the introduction so

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,160
yeah I'm gonna talk about sofa so so far

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,189
it's for yeah first first originally

8
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,620
from research and then you'll see it

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,589
became a bit wider than a research

10
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:38,650
suffice so multiphysics

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,390
and gene basically that we are that we

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,299
are using with emphasis for medical

13
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,159
application we will see that it can be

14
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,900
use for actually any kind of physics

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,510
simulation but that's the main purposes

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,269
it's open source so that like many

17
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,489
things here at first M and I'll tell you

18
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,110
a little bit about the story of sofa so

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,470
it started about 2000 in 2006 in Boston

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,559
MIT where a French researcher I had this

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,659
idea of creating a platform open source

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,990
platform for global globally physics

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,359
simulation he came back to France and

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,429
then at INRIA which is a Research

25
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:16,280
Institute for computer science it came

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,170
and start started developing this

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,479
platform in collaboration with four

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,570
different inner teams that was so they

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,280
worked about five during five years

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,590
together all those five those four teams

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,170
and then more and more companies and

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,509
startups studies looking at sofa and

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,030
having interest to that so now there is

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,179
a quite big community made from research

35
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,829
institution universities and also

36
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,270
companies so what is sofa so it's it's

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,100
making physics we'll see that just right

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,380
now what kind of physics it's doing but

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,090
how it is organized so there there is a

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,939
main core open source that anyone can

41
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,520
download use with the LGPL license so

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,409
it's quite permissive and then all

43
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,049
around it's why I wrote modular what you

44
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,209
are because you can build then your own

45
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,549
plugins and any kind of you know your

46
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,189
own module in which you're gonna develop

47
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,008
new classes new models to create your

48
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,200
own application and what is it that

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
useful because you know you can put any

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,190
kind of license you want on your own

51
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,800
code so basically you can do

52
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,540
a product or make your own research

53
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,960
private or open-source based on so far

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,460
using the that kind of plug-in

55
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,250
architecture it's multiphysics that's

56
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,600
what we're going to see just right now

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,540
and we are always targeting an

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,070
interactive simulation so pretty fast

59
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,760
simulation of physics and you can see

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,190
that at our booth in the building in

61
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,070
building K we have a haptic interface

62
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,620
showing a small demo with sofa so what

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,170
what what so if I said it's our DPL you

64
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,590
have displayed this plug in the system

65
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,450
so although although I mean usual stuff

66
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,430
so building with CMake we are and github

67
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,530
as well and so just like we has been

68
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,570
discussed previously and and two

69
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,220
dependencies which are a cutie and boost

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,410
we are cross-platform so you can use it

71
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,350
on any kind of platform you want what it

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,780
is doing for physics so for physics

73
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,750
there is usually I mean from from the

74
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,160
origin we were really focusing on

75
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,860
mechanical simulation so medical

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,780
simulation mechanical simulation in

77
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,060
medicine it was mainly you know how does

78
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,150
an organ behave or if you push on the on

79
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,730
the liver or on the brain how does this

80
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,770
organ is gonna respond so it's a bit of

81
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,050
battery but basically it was what it was

82
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,750
made for at the beginning and then we

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,250
started looking at more than just

84
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,500
mechanics but we looked at fluid

85
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,480
dynamics and also some kind of other

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,489
field simulation which is here

87
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,770
electrical field could be also

88
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,070
temperature field so thermal

89
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,230
thermodynamics um and all those stuff

90
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,900
are available then in sofa to make your

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,480
own simulation I mentioned you know it's

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,610
C++ classes but if you want to build

93
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,739
your own simulation you can use either

94
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,580
XML or Python scripts to script to then

95
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,670
describe and run your own simulation so

96
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,440
yeah some kind of battery that's the

97
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,660
kind of example we are doing what what

98
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,970
is the use of all that we are using

99
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,070
usually you know medical simulation so

100
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,680
physics simulation in medicine for

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,380
making training simulators or helping at

102
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,850
least surgeons you know during the

103
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,700
operation bringing new tools based on

104
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,250
simulation again you can you can join us

105
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,370
at at the building ki you'll see a lot

106
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,740
of different videos and so on

107
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,220
so uh does it work to build a simulation

108
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,970
all these each C++ class build what we

109
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,520
call the component here each one here is

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,789
a C++ class and then each component has

111
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,350
a role of course you're gonna have a

112
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,360
solver you're gonna have if you want a

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,389
mechanical simulation you will have a

114
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,550
mechanical low describing how does these

115
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,100
are this object deforms a mass and so on

116
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,380
basically all the physics and this is

117
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,840
described as a graph so a direct as you

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,710
click graph as we sell each node as I

119
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,470
mean each component in in this node will

120
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,630
have no parameters if you take the mass

121
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,520
for example the mass you need to define

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,370
the mass density or at least the total

123
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,830
mass of your object so that's that's how

124
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,370
it works

125
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,970
and this of this sin graph will be

126
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,900
described using the using XML scripts or

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,550
Python scripts Morris and here I've been

128
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,970
introduced so one one thing which is

129
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,160
very powerful about so far is that it's

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,960
not only you know not only physics you

131
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,210
have also visualization you have some

132
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,849
algorithms for a collision detection but

133
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,849
others that you know out of all those

134
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,979
different models you know you can have

135
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,770
one model for the visualization one

136
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,870
model for the physics one model for the

137
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,159
collision detection so let's do you see

138
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,400
now we see nothing ok and we see even

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,380
less nothing here no nothing ok so the

140
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,530
idea is that if you wanna I will

141
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,970
summarize basically all those different

142
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,320
sub here here you see a little bit

143
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,199
that's that's a liver a human liver

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,690
so the idea is the the power of this

145
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,970
multi multi model representation what it

146
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,300
is you can have different topology for

147
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,970
representing the same organ one will be

148
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,810
here it's small cubes which on which is

149
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,520
going to be computed the mechanics so

150
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,380
the mechanical simulation will be

151
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,460
computed on X I'd run and here you can

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,650
have for for example collision detection

153
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,470
you can use instead of cubes to be more

154
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,210
realistic you maybe you want to use a

155
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,120
triangulated surface but then you have

156
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,949
different objects one for the collision

157
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,020
one for the mechanics you can up here

158
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,030
for the visualization you see nothing so

159
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,620
it's really very nice for visualization

160
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,070
but so you how the question is then okay

161
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,449
you can have all those different models

162
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,820
that's cool but how do you relate them

163
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,040
that's what we call a mapping we have

164
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,660
mapping and making the correspondence

165
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,620
between the mechanics the physics

166
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,090
between the visualization that can be

167
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,100
different or the collision globally what

168
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,260
you need to watch is which is what is

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,120
needed here to ascend it's just that

170
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,639
what it allows to do is to set exactly

171
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,130
the power of computation where you want

172
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,539
if you want to have a very accurate

173
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:19,419
mechanical simulation and a crappy

174
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,820
visualization it's possible if you want

175
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,220
to have the inverse you know a crappy

176
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,960
mechanical system mechanical simulation

177
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,760
because you don't want to be accurate

178
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,240
and very very nice with the super nice

179
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,820
textures simulation it's also possible

180
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,680
because the two model are completely

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,620
independent to each other but then the

182
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,930
mechanics is gonna you know manage its

183
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,150
the master and the visualization just

184
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,070
grabs the slave and then you will have a

185
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,780
very nice simulation with a nice

186
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,000
visualization even if the mechanical

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,090
simulation is very simple behind so you

188
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,590
have you have some other features in

189
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,330
sofa just like you know GPU computing

190
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,770
which is possible there is a plugin

191
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,340
allowing for using the using the GPU of

192
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,340
your view of your computers you can have

193
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,830
and you can couple any kind of physics

194
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,720
simulation with optic device that's what

195
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,060
we have at the booth that's what you can

196
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,830
see here at the video you have a physics

197
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,919
simulation ok cool it's running it's

198
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,780
running in real time but on top of that

199
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,400
you can directly interact with the

200
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,820
simulation so here the tools are I mean

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,710
there is an interface between the optic

202
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,740
devices and the simulation and therefore

203
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,780
the user can directly you know use I

204
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,729
mean use the tool and God exactly a

205
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,679
feedback he's interacting with real

206
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,650
objects everything is virtual but he's

207
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,469
gonna have some optic feedback so you

208
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,549
can also couple

209
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,429
virtual with virtual simulation with

210
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,920
with some optic and interface interface

211
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,830
device ISM many other stuff so there is

212
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,170
you know I said you can create new

213
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,470
plugins adding new features to sofa

214
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,760
for example you have something which is

215
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
dealing with medical images you have

216
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,530
something about registration changes of

217
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,910
topologies for example if you are

218
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,040
cutting an objector you have to update

219
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,890
the topology so update what the geometry

220
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,170
basically of your of your objects that's

221
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,030
available also in so far so now there is

222
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,370
a concise I mean you know I told you it

223
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,860
started in 2006 there was researchers

224
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,630
and so on now there is that there have

225
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,430
been some companies startups that has

226
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,380
been created as well so we built a

227
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,600
consortium so that also single

228
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,790
developers companies researchers are

229
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,220
basically happy with what is with what

230
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,650
is going on and we are providing regular

231
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,990
releases of sofa that's what we are

232
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,660
doing and we are taking care of you know

233
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,720
promoting sofa and basically for example

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,150
if there is any single developer using

235
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,160
sofa making his own application we are

236
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,620
also here to promote his or her work

237
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,920
around sofa find partnership and and and

238
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,730
talk to to the open source community so

239
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,310
yeah there is a website on this website

240
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,800
a forum to ask questions to start with

241
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,020
so far there is also tutorials videos

242
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,030
and so far where you can see the

243
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,950
different kind of application examples

244
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,590
that you could that you can achieve with

245
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,460
the platform and so that's the different

246
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,100
members that are joining us for the last

247
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,930
form of four months so it's a pretty

248
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,990
young consortium but it's it's still

249
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,900
growing and here are all the stuff that

250
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,480
you can you should remember is that's

251
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,600
it's on github so if you want to see and

252
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,060
discuss about the code it's on github so

253
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,370
so far framework there is a YouTube

254
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,290
channels of a framework as well we can

255
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,540
find all the videos and achievement of

256
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,320
researchers and companies and and and so

257
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,030
Twitter of course but and and then the

258
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,740
forum where you can ask questions and

259
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,150
really get started with so far so

260
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,530
whatever just what I can tell is so as

261
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,510
it's you know open source as many things

262
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,040
in the info stem you can basically

263
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,490
download so far get give it a try make

264
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,260
your own experience with it give us

265
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,930
feedback about that and also create then

266
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,880
your own application we will I mean my

267
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,920
job is also to make so that any kind of

268
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,240
application created we serve

269
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,569
get a get a get an end user and get

270
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,490
promoted so do not hesitate to use it

271
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,559
ask question of the forum you can also

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,249
contact me directly for email and do not

273
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,170
is that you come at our booth so we are

274
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,819
at keh keh keh - and booth number 1517

275
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,639
sorry 15 is maybe cool as well I don't

276
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,519
know and and yeah - there is a small

277
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,889
live demos oh and other videos to show

278
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,269
what kind of achievement you can do this

279
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,670
so far so do the latest day to join us I

280
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,709
would be happy to talk with you so thank

281
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:45,220
you very much thank you very much you go

282
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,110
and we still have a couple of minutes

283
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,149
left so if there are any questions just

284
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,949
raise your hand and I'll get the mic to

285
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:57,839
you yeah there I see one

286
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,230
I have a question you used a finite

287
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,260
element formulation or another type or

288
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,960
do you have many different types yeah

289
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,600
for for the approach that it's chosen

290
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,270
its many finite element method there is

291
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,450
also some SPH approach MLS approach that

292
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,180
has been implemented in so far but very

293
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,150
few and grids grid simulation has been

294
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,650
very naturally considered you know you

295
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,110
know but that could be interesting for

296
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,630
only thermal thermal simulation but

297
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,190
mainly FM FM simulation so any other

298
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,160
questions well then I suggest we wrap up

299
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,180
Europe thank you very much thank you

300
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,839
[Applause]
