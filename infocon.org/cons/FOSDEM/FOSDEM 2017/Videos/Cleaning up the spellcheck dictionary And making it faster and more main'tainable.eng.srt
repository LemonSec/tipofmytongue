1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,260
so this is not going to be a very deeply

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,930
technical presentation but we are

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,210
talking about how to improve the

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,180
spellcheck dictionary in general in

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:30,090
terms of maintainability and and size

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,420
something about me I'm active as

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,610
volunteer in several free and

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,970
open-source project for several years I

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,520
do all of this in my spare time which is

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,950
very very thin so if you consider it's

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,020
spread among different projects actually

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,750
my contribution to individual projects

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,730
tend to be quite smaller in the past

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,420
this project included responsibilities

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,550
at apache openoffice where I serve

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,019
there's a project chair and a release

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,370
manager but now we are just focusing

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,710
back I can personally just focusing back

19
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,570
on maintaining a general-purpose Italian

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,530
spell check dictionary that is used that

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:27,340
in many projects sorry about the caf so

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,799
status of the Italian dictionary

23
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,909
history it's been developed for about 15

24
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,920
years so it is an old dictionary and no

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
dictionary does mean something in its

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,200
not we will see that even dictionaries

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,979
can have some legacy issues it had the

28
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,439
different maintainer and while it is

29
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,759
only text files it's amazing how many

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,520
conventions you can mix up mix up and

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,030
mess up with with many maintain years

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,670
taking care of the the so called code

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,269
even in the histone rules words and

34
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,160
rules I've been maintaining the

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,890
dictionary for say that the last 10

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,799
years approximately it is built for up

37
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,670
an office but it is used as ease or with

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,269
the minor changes like packaging it into

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,569
a no XD files to go back to the previous

40
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,650
talk by many free and open source

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,799
applications so basically every time you

42
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,790
have an Italian spellcheck somewhere

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,790
probably the underlying dictionary files

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,810
come from either this project or a

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:54,090
variant of it as the maintainer my

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,669
burden is especially with the support

47
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,040
requests and user reports there were

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,609
very frequent in the early stages where

49
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,669
the dictionary was was still being built

50
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,919
so the dictionary was incomplete and you

51
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,280
got the neck every day with missing

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,859
words nor everything now it is much less

53
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,739
frequent since the product is matira say

54
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,549
we cover we can consider the the

55
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,040
dictionary to really be in maintenance

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,959
mode it fulfills its tasks and and now

57
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,540
there are just minor fixes but

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,700
maintenance is always required even

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,889
Italian is changing of course meaning

60
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:43,230
that no later than a few months ago

61
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,190
baby in Italy was I don't know how many

62
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,560
of you speak Italian so ok keep this

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,530
generic baby in Italy was seeing a

64
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,290
flower and inventing a word that does

65
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,140
not exist in Italian for a flower with a

66
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,090
lot of petals around it the word didn't

67
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,180
exist but the issue was brought up to

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,510
the Italian national authorities so to

69
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,589
say about the Italian language and they

70
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,350
approved this new word officially so the

71
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,839
next day I had my inbox full of people

72
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,340
who asked to the dictionary and of

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,229
course if an 8 year old child can do

74
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,120
that then everybody else was inventing

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,760
words and asking for them to be formally

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,889
approved so it was kind of a frenzy

77
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,840
moment even though the language is

78
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,760
supposed to be stable so the request

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,729
types we get our type 1 very easy you

80
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,479
type a normal world do you find out that

81
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,450
it is underlined red and the next step

82
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,210
you just send an email to me sing to add

83
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,680
it to the dictionary now this is very

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,560
very rare actually most of the time this

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,639
happens it is actually typed to request

86
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,340
we still have this small flow of

87
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,389
requests that cannot be addressed

88
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,940
because they are just wrong they don't

89
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,729
people do not take the time to spend 1

90
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,770
minutes and actually checking in a real

91
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,539
dictionary if they are suggesting

92
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,889
something that should be narrow should

93
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,289
not be there and most of the times

94
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,360
actually it should not be there so I

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,910
already have canned answers to people

96
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,250
saying no but this world does not exist

97
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,080
I know that a lot of people use it but

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,169
it is not a real word the please do not

99
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,270
ask for it to be included or for your

100
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,770
own dictionary but then it will not be

101
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,370
Italian and type 3 is the interesting

102
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,690
one since it is what we are discussing

103
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,940
now I got an increasing

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,930
of requests to remove wrong words people

105
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,070
that say I misspelled a word but it was

106
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,610
still recognized as valid in these cases

107
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,600
actually the words that they believe

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,980
they do not exist our existing are

109
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,770
legitimate Italian words just nobody is

110
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,340
using them any longer so our issue is

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,650
probably that the dictionary has now

112
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,260
grown to the point and this holds for

113
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,030
Italian but surely for for the English

114
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,010
dictionary we are seeing the same issue

115
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,530
and for many other dictionaries to be to

116
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,450
complete for its intended use case ok

117
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,900
then the standard answer you give to

118
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,030
this in office applications is please

119
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,620
supplement your spell checker with a

120
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,990
grammar checker a grammar checker is

121
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,180
able to identify rare words and it might

122
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,140
be helpful in cases like this meaning

123
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,270
that you see something that is not wrong

124
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,520
so it cannot be underlined wrong but it

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,640
is underlined in some way to tell you

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,410
okay but if you are using this word

127
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,570
either you are talking about something

128
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,050
really strange or there is something

129
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,620
going something wrong in in your text

130
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,220
and also it is not a perfect solution

131
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,260
because a grammar checker last time I

132
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,870
checked this use a job was not really

133
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,820
able to identify all variants of the

134
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,740
world meaning you identify the base word

135
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,460
but not all of its variants and it is

136
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,130
not compatible with all use cases in in

137
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,470
an office suite it makes sense to have a

138
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,440
grammar checker but this dictionary is

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,700
used everywhere in small application in

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,770
probably also for spell checking

141
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,849
deterrence on smartphones and

142
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,379
a many small software that do not

143
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,089
implement an interface for grammar

144
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,159
checking because they they do not need

145
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,789
it so it is time to trim the dictionary

146
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,449
or to at least think if it is right to

147
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,879
three individual tools of the trade

148
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,759
we have also good old text editor simple

149
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,949
text editor everything is in text files

150
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,909
some statistical analysis tools for a

151
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,529
medium-sized data we are not talking big

152
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,440
data here it's hundreds of thousand a

153
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,789
word which is big but it is not the kind

154
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,740
of data that would properly be

155
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,940
classified as big data and the hospitals

156
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:55,290
and custom scripts I did okay you'd have

157
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,329
an example here and in case that people

158
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,670
are not familiar with with the format we

159
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,370
use it is simply one huge text files

160
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,600
text file with the stems

161
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,910
meaning the the base form of the word

162
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,720
like this is to talk in Italian Perl are

163
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,910
a set of letters and combination what

164
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,649
does this mean this means that this is a

165
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,810
verb to talk and here you have rules to

166
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,920
form all derivatives forms of this world

167
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,829
so basically you would if this was

168
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,800
English you would have a talk and here a

169
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,259
rule that is defined separately and

170
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,660
means from tolk you derive talking you'd

171
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,180
have talked you derive everything that

172
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,079
is related to talking one can follow a

173
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,720
completely different approach that is

174
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,389
exploding this and creating even huge

175
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,620
text file but it will not work with

176
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,220
synonyms for example in you for synonyms

177
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,819
it is always important that you can

178
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,259
reduce back to the stem of

179
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:12,239
the world since that is what you need

180
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,239
for for creating the the synonyms

181
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,419
otherwise in in office applications for

182
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,519
example all the all the synonyms will

183
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,669
break if the dictionary is not using

184
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:29,039
this or will be inefficient much much so

185
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,399
what I try to do is to create a corpus

186
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,579
meaning finding all possible Italian

187
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:38,069
words from somewhere this is impossible

188
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:41,699
as a task of course but you can try to

189
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:45,359
get some approximation the bad part here

190
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:49,379
is that you can use news Wikipedia

191
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,929
articles recent books because I do not

192
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,649
want words that were used through two

193
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:56,509
centuries ago

194
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,069
Italian is a quite an odd language by

195
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:05,009
language standards and it is almost in

196
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,669
its current form since it has been in

197
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,979
that form for eight centuries more or

198
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:15,989
less man was sanitization is necessary

199
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,660
because news will contain person names

200
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,850
and other stuff that you do not want in

201
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,179
a dictionary and for no matter how hard

202
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,839
I try I never manage to to get past the

203
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,169
50% of Bayes words which basically means

204
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,489
half of my dictionary is useless in in

205
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:45,169
real use cases and what's even worse

206
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,959
only about 5% of all possible variants

207
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,089
are considered because here it is much

208
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,059
matter of copy pasting I mean if if a

209
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,730
verb behaves like behaves like another

210
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,759
verb then I will just copy paste all

211
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,009
variants but some of them are really

212
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,679
sound strange in Italian are not real

213
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,059
Italian words

214
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:19,579
so what we got in the end was that we

215
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,949
remove the old words that do not appear

216
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,600
in the corpus this is much much more

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
trickier and if any of you has some

218
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,880
smart ideas come to me after the talk

219
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,560
and we can try how to make it in an

220
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,899
efficient way the variants that are

221
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:47,310
never used are removed of course this is

222
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,199
more complex because you do not just

223
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,990
remove a line but part of it and it

224
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,339
becomes quite complex what about the

225
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,699
future of this prototype I think the

226
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,220
full dictionary will still be maintained

227
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,079
that the one that will be properly

228
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,019
maintained is the full dictionary and it

229
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,639
will be the default one the one from

230
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,490
which in dictionaries for office suites

231
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,500
for Thunderbird for email clients are

232
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
created even for text editors of course

233
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,100
but we might decide to accompany it with

234
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,480
a lite version use cases are all use

235
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,500
cases where a normal dictionary could be

236
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,010
too big and used as it big so when you

237
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,160
are very limited will you have very

238
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,199
limited resources like lightweight or

239
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,540
mobile for language learners we might

240
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,220
publish a simple Italian dictionary and

241
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,149
people who are learning Italian would

242
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,519
know that the underlined words are words

243
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,149
that they are not supposed to to know

244
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,269
because they are advanced words and

245
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:08,519
everything else is in their range of

246
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,160
expected skills for example use cases a

247
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,889
may be found and

248
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,119
and I'm happy if you have any creative

249
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:24,079
creative ideas on how to use a

250
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,809
lightweight dictionaries to just talk to

251
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,429
me after after my talk that's it thank

252
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,150
you

253
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:40,409
[Applause]
