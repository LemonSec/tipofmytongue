1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,780
I'm gonna into this year really quickly

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,220
you started contributing to

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,130
the age of 11 after accidentally hitting

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,200
f1 in Firefox and being taken to the now

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:53,880
I know from working on discourse

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,140
development for various clients

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,820
including Mozilla it's just a shame it

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,560
might also be my last so I've been

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
filtering from Mozilla for the past

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,140
eight years I started contributing with

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,180
efforts to use discourse within Mozilla

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,460
around three years ago and I've been

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,240
working for Mozilla and discourse on my

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,010
gap year before going off to university

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,210
next year so what is this course if you

16
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,250
haven't met it before this is how I like

17
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,470
to describe it it's film software

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,229
designed for and in the 21st century

19
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,960
because when you think of form software

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,430
you probably think of something that

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,700
looks a little bit like this now I'm 19

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,130
years old and this was designed when I

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,130
was a baby and which you know isn't

24
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,750
great forum software shouldn't be old

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,960
enough to give a conference talk and a

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,700
web application that is based on a

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,680
design that's now old enough to drive to

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,080
drape to marry to join the military and

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,060
so many other things is not software

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,729
that's making full use of their

31
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,590
capabilities that the modern web web

32
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,568
gives us so enter this course it has a

33
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,068
huge number of features that are

34
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,099
standard within form software and a huge

35
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,569
number of features that are not that

36
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,159
made use of them on the web too many to

37
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,200
list but some of them include an

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,630
infinite scroll the pages aren't

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,660
click through them and incredibly good

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,950
mobile support now why are we in the

41
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,900
Mozilla dev room well Mozilla runs its

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,780
own discourse instance and Mozilla has a

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,700
somewhat unique use case when it comes

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,100
to discourse we used to use in news

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,050
groups we're used to using mailing lists

46
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,020
and so this idea of using web software

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,980
to talk is not necessarily a comfortable

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,110
thing for everybody at Mozilla and this

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,820
Web Store supports an incredibly good

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,810
email in capabilities but they're not

51
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,180
there yet and the net exposed to user as

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,950
well as they could be so that's what I'm

53
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,450
working on currently but there's a huge

54
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,650
amount of what to do

55
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,480
and they need some help and need some

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,650
help from you so who are you I had to

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,910
make some assumptions about who you are

58
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,590
in order to make a talk that doesn't

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,630
span you know hours and hours and hours

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,220
and so here are some of them you're

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,050
using Linux rather than Mac OS or

62
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,150
Windows these instructions will work

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,160
there but you're going to have to Google

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,480
a little bit to find out what they are

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,090
and you're not scared by terminal maybe

66
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,740
you haven't used a terminal all that

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,960
much but the prospect of using and then

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,480
doesn't make you wet yourself you have a

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,310
rudimentary knowledge of get you maybe

70
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,860
know how to clone a repository but not

71
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,600
much more than that that's all right and

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,890
you've turned it around with code a

73
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,420
little bit you maybe don't know a

74
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,800
programming language particularly well

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,050
but again code doesn't scare you I mean

76
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,350
and you don't necessarily know Ruby it's

77
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,160
not a requirement

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,010
it's what discourse is programmed on on

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,740
the server-side and this really is the

80
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,700
easiest thing for me to talk about

81
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,920
because this is who I was when I started

82
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,170
contributing to discourse when I started

83
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,170
developing with discourse so I've played

84
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,660
about who you are now what is discourse

85
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,580
at least from a development perspective

86
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,850
well it really it really makes sense to

87
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,030
think of it as two separate applications

88
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,709
and the front end we have an ember app

89
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,959
that interacts with the back end which

90
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,730
is a rails app and they interact through

91
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,190
an API now this separation between

92
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,720
front-end and back-end came to leave

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
some confusion especially maybe if

94
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,840
you're already an experienced rails

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,919
developer

96
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,860
well discourse doesn't work quite as a

97
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,620
normal well that would because of this

98
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,090
separation and it can also lead to some

99
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,219
confusion because you have replication

100
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,169
of like model names and so on and so

101
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,300
forth on the front end on the back end

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
but I think it can also make

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,300
contributing to discourse and developing

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,979
the discourse a lot easier because it

105
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,029
means you don't necessarily have to know

106
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,460
everything in order to do something you

107
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,349
could as a JavaScript developer very

108
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,389
easily contribute to discourse just on

109
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,779
the front end I mean now everything I

110
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,270
talk about in this talk is information

111
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,460
that is located elsewhere and the steps

112
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,500
are about to go through and the rest of

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,909
this talk are really going to be a size

114
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,930
a ssin of the sort of document I suppose

115
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,789
it would be for concreting to discourse

116
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:11,990
which would be discourse development

117
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,580
contribution guidelines on the meta

118
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,800
discourse instance it's linked on the

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,629
schedule I'm going to summarize some bit

120
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,129
some day run through some bits faster

121
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,680
than then I'm done here I'm going to

122
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,689
expand on some bits really if you do

123
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,339
want to contribute to discourse you've

124
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,930
got to give this a read there's no way I

125
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,999
can express all the information that it

126
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:34,159
has right now so setting up your little

127
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,199
development environment you could go to

128
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,270
a package manager and install ruby and

129
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,629
install rails and install Postgres and

130
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,919
every number of dependency that

131
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,899
discourse relies upon and spend hours

132
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,490
setting it up but we don't want to do

133
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:46,819
that

134
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,500
we're beginners we're going to do this

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,419
quickly so there's a very simple

136
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,180
two-step setup process one clone the git

137
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,599
repository to run vagrant up and once

138
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,210
you've done that everything set up so

139
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,669
let's go into a bit more detail and

140
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,740
install virtualbox this of course is

141
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,300
going to vary from distribution to

142
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,240
distribution from operating system to

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,589
operating system if you're trying to do

144
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,279
this on Windows but I'm just install it

145
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,800
I mean it varies so much it's in the

146
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,169
package manager install it and beware

147
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,909
depending what Linux distribution you're

148
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,439
running you may have to enable

149
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,180
kernel module and also make sure you've

150
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,759
enabled virtualization in your BIOS it's

151
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,490
drawing vagrant again just install it

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,860
it's in your package manager do it and

153
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,710
get again there's a bit of a theme here

154
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,039
just install it now we get into some

155
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,639
commands we get into our terminal so

156
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,750
of course we're going to clone the get

157
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,810
repository and I tend to play everything

158
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,550
into a project sold by having my home

159
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,699
folder and so of course run git clone

160
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,860
I've cut off the name of the repository

161
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,639
it's too big

162
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,610
I've linked to the github page in the

163
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,310
schedule wait a little bit for I get to

164
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,490
download everything and then go into the

165
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,620
directory that's been created and

166
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,719
recommend you check out the tests pass

167
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:06,849
branch our discourse has different

168
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,990
branches for different stages of

169
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,060
development and the master branch is

170
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,090
untested code the test past branch as

171
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,400
the name suggests is code that is only

172
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,189
that after it's run against discourse

173
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,229
automated tests and it provides a level

174
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,779
of stability next we need to run vagrant

175
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,509
so first we run vagrant up in the same

176
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,490
directory and myrtana this will pull in

177
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,439
the favorite of the VirtualBox virtual

178
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,090
machine it will install some

179
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,180
dependencies once it's finished variant

180
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,599
SSH to enter the vagrant machine so now

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,860
we need to set up the vagrant box

182
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,990
because we've got a development

183
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,879
environment in our neighbor box but

184
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,440
there's a bit of housekeeping we need to

185
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,180
do and we need to do every time the

186
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,740
object discourse but I'll get into that

187
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,370
in a minute

188
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,529
so first we want to enter the vagrant

189
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,839
directory in the vagrant box this is

190
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,310
where the discourse source code lives

191
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,870
the the slash discourse directory that

192
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,150
exists on a host has been linked to this

193
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,889
directory so if you were to list here

194
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,289
mist here you would see your discourse

195
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,659
source directory there we need to

196
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,520
install the gems that discourse relies

197
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
upon gems are what you know NPM packages

198
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,430
are to JavaScript what anything is to

199
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,979
anything in in when it comes to various

200
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,509
programming languages the little bits of

201
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,250
code the discord relies upon but you

202
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,900
didn't have to worry too much about then

203
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,520
you need to run your database migrations

204
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,339
so that the database and the code is all

205
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,949
synced up finally we need to create an

206
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,930
admin user so that you can actually log

207
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,760
into your discourse site when to stop

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,828
and then you start the rails server and

209
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,419
thence you've done all of this when you

210
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,529
visit localhost colon

211
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,169
4000 we should have a development

212
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,990
environment so we're gonna want to stop

213
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,430
this at some point so of course kill the

214
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,540
rails process exit your vagrant box and

215
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,510
stop it so I mentioned before we

216
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,530
to keep things up today and we should

217
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,540
keep things up to date because otherwise

218
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,830
we're going to be developing against

219
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,900
other inversions of discos so you need

220
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,940
to pull in the changes from get and we

221
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,650
need to go through and you need to go

222
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,910
through the previous process again

223
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,220
starting the very box entering it

224
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,730
entering the correct folder installing

225
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,700
our gems running our database migrations

226
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,400
and starting the process that the server

227
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,950
process again now there are various

228
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,020
things that run in the side of discourse

229
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,110
to do various things especially for

230
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,850
development so send email especially if

231
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,530
you're developing with email like we do

232
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,530
it within Mozilla and so there's a

233
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,390
program that can be run which will catch

234
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,980
any email so you're not actually sending

235
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,690
it to the real world you don't have to

236
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,390
worry about sending setting up an SMTP

237
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,960
server and so run that command and you

238
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,160
should be good to go

239
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,650
you may get an error and the docs say

240
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,990
you may get an error if you do run that

241
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,000
command when the previous one and then

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,980
visit localhost port

243
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,800
4080 and you'll find the mail catch in

244
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,930
interface and whenever you send an email

245
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,290
it will appear there I'm also sort

246
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,900
essential for sending email and various

247
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,950
tasks in the discourse is the sidekick

248
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,230
queue manager some things within

249
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,880
discourse will send things off to this

250
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,680
queue to get processed it needs to be

251
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
running in development for any of those

252
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,190
jobs to happen and but you don't

253
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,170
necessarily need it so with this one

254
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,090
with the previous command just open

255
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,090
another terminal enter your VapoRub box

256
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,440
go into the right directory and run the

257
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,590
commands now choosing a text editor were

258
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,020
less there we must run some code but we

259
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,640
need to choose a text editor to get

260
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,860
anything done well we have some

261
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,240
requirements for the stack service those

262
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,250
release what it text that's the sole

263
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,000
essential one I mean I know you take

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
this is should edit text but I've

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,740
somehow wimps got myself stuck in a vim

266
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,290
edit window and from what I could see it

267
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,940
didn't edit text it was just a very

268
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,190
complicated puzzle of how to get myself

269
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,430
out of it and so so we use a text editor

270
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,740
that you know how to use also it's very

271
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,210
important that your text as it has a

272
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,580
file name such

273
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,140
because when you're developing with

274
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,850
discourse it's quite a large code base

275
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,130
and a lot of what files do and that's

276
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,320
stored within the files but in the file

277
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,089
name itself so you need a text editor

278
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,000
that does that I never saw a text editor

279
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
that does global search because the

280
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,500
discourse is spread across merciful

281
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,120
files you're going on to how to search

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,670
through them very easily and finally

283
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,149
it's time to do some development so this

284
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,070
course is a huge codebase it's larger

285
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,600
than anything I had ever worked on

286
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,120
before it's big it can be quite scary

287
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,950
and you can spell it seems like a very

288
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,170
long time and they absolutely no idea

289
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,620
what's going on I still do and how do

290
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,870
you get started really depends how you

291
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,779
like to learn new things and I always

292
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,430
like throwing myself in the deep end and

293
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,959
trying to figure out things from there

294
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,850
and I think there's a great approach

295
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,410
because especially with something as

296
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,730
large as discourse if you were to try

297
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,020
and sit there and read every piece of

298
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,850
documentation available to you by the

299
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,470
time you got to the end of it you don't

300
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,660
forgot what you said you wrote you read

301
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,779
and learnt at the beginning so yes the

302
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,520
approach that I took was learning what

303
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,290
they needed to know as I needed to know

304
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,620
it and there are some Doc's that can

305
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,060
help you with that what you're doing but

306
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,829
some standard documentation that may

307
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,110
help you is to begin with the world's

308
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,390
guide now I mentioned before discourse

309
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,310
isn't quite as standard rails app this

310
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,829
doc this guide may not help you as much

311
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,709
as you think it should because discourse

312
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,110
doesn't do everything the rels that is

313
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,170
usual within rails I mean but I found it

314
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,399
very useful for certain things I

315
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,600
particularly found it very useful for

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
the active record documentation when I

317
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,930
wanted to interact with the database

318
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,820
when I wanted to interact with models

319
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,490
and the my guide is also essential but

320
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,200
for the same way an essential is also

321
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,970
very useful for the same reason it's not

322
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,640
essential discourse isn't quite a

323
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,110
standard ember app there are various

324
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,510
things they do all by themselves and of

325
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,720
course when you're editing elements of

326
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,890
discourse you're not creating a new

327
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,870
ember application you don't necessarily

328
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,300
need to know how everything works and

329
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,180
finally and most importantly discourse

330
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,510
matter so the discourse instant the

331
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,490
discourse runs this is where you're

332
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,800
going to find basically everything you

333
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,180
need to know it's

334
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,310
become your best friend and any question

335
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,350
you have has probably already been asked

336
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,660
and already answered that there's also a

337
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,870
great source of documentation the two

338
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,280
most useful categories you'll find out

339
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,380
I'll be hell to slash developers

340
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,280
category and be dev one and and this one

341
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,450
is probably then you're going to learn

342
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,930
to us a question if you get stuck now

343
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,330
the single best topic I've found which

344
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,070
most accurately describes the steps I

345
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,860
went through to learn how to develop

346
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,760
with discourse is is is them like this I

347
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,610
wish this that exists existed Weiss to

348
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,300
got started and so it's brilliant guide

349
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,530
how to start building stuff for

350
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,440
discourse if you're a newbie like myself

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,790
goes through almost all the steps you're

352
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,370
going to require I've already talked

353
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,110
about a few of them there are some X

354
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,030
ones there that you you will want to

355
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,770
take a look at again this is linked in

356
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,830
the schedule so we've set a lot of

357
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,270
environment we've opened our text editor

358
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,830
we've learned how to ask for help now

359
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,670
there can you walk on there's a lot of

360
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,960
things that we want done within Mazar

361
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,900
and these are all listed in an issue

362
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,000
tracker that's linked on the discourse

363
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
page on Amazon lucky again linked in the

364
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,990
schedule so take a look there if you

365
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,510
want to and also and this course meta

366
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,480
the PA welcome tag lists everything that

367
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,090
the discourse team themselves have said

368
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,130
that then every feature request they've

369
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,990
said would be welcome in this course but

370
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,640
they're not necessarily willing to spend

371
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,650
development time on so look for those

372
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,190
topics and just get started again a link

373
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,980
to that is in the schedule so you may

374
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
have some questions and when you come to

375
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,730
doing development

376
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,820
first of all search on discourse matter

377
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,260
it's almost certainly been asked before

378
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,180
it almost certainly been answered before

379
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,430
if you can't find anything that

380
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,290
describes what you're wanting post on

381
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,970
discourse matter and and you should hear

382
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,840
feedback from the developers and if both

383
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,350
of those approaches fell feel free to

384
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,840
reach out to me I'm out Leo MCA and the

385
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,640
meta discourse and I'm at Leo on

386
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,190
Mozilla's discourse incident and with

387
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,040
that my talk is over

388
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,560
but as the title says if any of you have

389
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,839
any questions on the available ma'am yes

390
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,630
yes but it met the officially supported

391
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,200
way so um there is a doctor development

392
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,710
image that I have been playing around

393
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,850
with a little bit lately

394
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,010
it's suddenly a lot faster to doing

395
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,770
docker it's certainly less taxing on

396
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,380
your computer's resources I think it

397
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,060
like almost doubles the battery life of

398
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,410
my laptop if I do it in Dhaka rather

399
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,390
than a vagrant but I've said it's not

400
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,040
the officially supported way and there

401
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,810
are still a few things that are that are

402
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,640
that are possibly missing and possibly

403
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,290
not working I haven't had the

404
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,700
opportunity to fully explore it myself

405
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
but if you are interested in doing it in

406
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,480
dr. Robbins vagrant if you want to set

407
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,280
that challenge for yourself again just

408
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,780
look on the meta discourse incident and

409
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,700
that there are instructions there just

410
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,820
search for docker development any others

411
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:40,910
I don't see any hands going up I haven't

412
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,190
I haven't blogged about it but it's um

413
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,090
that there there are instructions on

414
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,810
meta discourse yeah

415
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,920
you
