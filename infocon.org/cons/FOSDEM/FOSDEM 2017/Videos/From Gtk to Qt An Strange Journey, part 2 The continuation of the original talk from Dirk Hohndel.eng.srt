1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,269
thank you

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,350
to start talking as usual I was

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,230
finishing my slides just five minutes

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,389
before the talking starts which means

5
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,129
that I never finished had my stuff my

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,500
phone which is quite okay because I

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,090
never actually finished anything that I

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,699
started like I'm still ten years on the

9
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,320
university no twelve sorry and when I

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,310
started doing programming I was five

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,310
years old because my dad is crazy and I

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,550
grew up I started doing other stuff and

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,489
one day I was seated in my computer

14
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,010
trying to program and I saw this and

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,629
this was an invitation for cute

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,670
developers to start trying to port an

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,120
application that was initiated by Linus

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,000
Torvalds using CNG GK and man I was

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,440
thrilled because well as as a kid I

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,510
always wanted to actually start

21
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,070
programming with my heroes of

22
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,740
programming like I am honored for my

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,520
whole life and I had my first computer

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,540
when I was 2 or 3 years old it was an

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,400
Atari I don't even know if they make

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,420
them anymore

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,960
and Dirk Honda was a second in command

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,170
of the Linux kernel and he started this

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,780
programming with Minister Hodes it's a

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,909
diving application I never dive it in my

31
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,570
life but I really wanted to do one thing

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,399
well I like to experiment with new

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,119
things so I did origami after origami I

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,110
felt that I was an OK origami artist so

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,659
I did pole dancing

36
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,939
I did one or two years of pole dancing

37
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,830
lessons I tried to do a

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,659
semi-professional pole dancing

39
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,020
presentation in Brazil but then I

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,909
started doing theater after I ended on

41
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,288
the theater I was a KD developer and

42
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,780
Phil fizzle is the biggest free software

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,150
convention in Brazil we have 10,000

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,720
people going there annually usually and

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,800
well I don't I don't feel shame about

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,640
that and then I started tap-dancing for

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,630
some reason but I really wanted should

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,030
program something Williams mostly

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,200
because he thinks that C++ it has

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,930
horrible horrible language and it's made

51
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,390
more horrible by the fact that a lot of

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,090
substandard programmers use it hello to

53
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,709
the point where it's much easier to

54
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,900
generate total and neuter crap with it

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,690
quite frankly even if that choice of C

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,880
were to do nothing but keep the C++

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,000
programmers out that itself would be a

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,010
huge reason to you see

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,200
yeah I made Leo store all Co C++ and I'm

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,900
not afraid of that I actually put that

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,850
on my resume

62
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,860
[Applause]

63
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,640
it is awesome because I was yelled two

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,459
times two today which is nice because

65
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,470
usually aliens don't just yell he throws

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,489
people on the windows oh if I have time

67
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,030
later

68
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,069
if anyone dude the question are you give

69
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:43,929
the Fez you have

70
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,030
so I really like to be a vector entropy

71
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,170
I like to make you know zo C++ I like to

72
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,540
make my wife that is they're afraid of

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,080
me sometimes I like to make my brother

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,920
say oh my god no well I put my pole

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,630
dancing picture on his Facebook profile

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,270
then I download that the gets worse from

77
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,980
subsurface oh man it was UI application

78
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,700
done by kernel developers it was a

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,680
really big spaghetti code nothing was

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,230
happening as I wanted as a UI developer

81
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,210
I I know that I need separate code I

82
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,330
need to do some stuff as MVC and Lina's

83
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,880
told me that well that's just theater

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,100
crap you have no game from doing that

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,510
yes so I had those were the original

86
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,850
problems that I saw on the original code

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,280
base from subsurface there is no

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
separation between the UI and the car

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,490
whatsoever

90
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,710
the lack of the knowledge in the

91
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,660
original library now I need to stop a

92
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,630
little bit because I am a cute developer

93
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,169
and the application was dedicated Lauper

94
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,870
GTA that locked up GT K and cute are

95
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,060
usually seen as fighting with each other

96
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,160
but there is not just through the

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,350
problem on this application regarding GT

98
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,210
k is that the developers of the

99
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,810
application limos and Dirk usually they

100
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,240
didn't know how to use the TK it's not

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,250
just case fault the fault of the

102
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,770
educator was they didn't found people on

103
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,430
litigate your problem the lack of UX

104
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,470
well they are kernel developers they

105
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,760
don't care about you like but they

106
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,500
really needed to do something quite

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,100
pretty if they want people to use it and

108
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,770
they had in the time 50 users now they

109
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,430
have more than 3000 so good lack of

110
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,890
integration the base systems they had an

111
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,260
application that look at like really

112
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,370
almost not user crack on Linux and it

113
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,830
looked like user crap on OS 10 and

114
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,960
windle's it worked but it was not

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,220
integrated whatsoever

116
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,830
and lack of anyone who give it a ship

117
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,599
because nobody was actually helping them

118
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:56,930
to

119
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,020
anything so they did sorry that they

120
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,240
invited people should try to help and I

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,400
saw this I was bored in my work and I

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,500
saw this and since I was doing not in my

123
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,509
work I was paid should just stare off

124
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,970
the roof I use it my work time to

125
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:23,150
develop super surgeries and this was the

126
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,699
original subsurface code but not really

127
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,610
but mostly like that I mean they they

128
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,910
have their around ten files for

129
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,099
everything it was a scary it's too scary

130
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,130
because on the parts from C to C plus

131
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,440
plus I had to give a lot of the C parts

132
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,849
and the civil sauce part and well it's

133
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,680
now like this after two months of work

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
I've managed to separate the car and the

135
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,610
interface I'm gonna show a little bit of

136
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,169
the code I'm gonna show the interfaces

137
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,630
but I have no experience joint

138
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,870
presentations I usually and latex guy so

139
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,440
it's usually worse than that car it's a

140
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,830
mess and the interface is a stillness

141
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,389
because I am the only one that knows how

142
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,460
to do the interface and the carbine a

143
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,470
mess I cannot actually make a really

144
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,970
good code for the interface because I

145
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,680
have to deal with the mess that is the

146
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,880
core and well mess mess mess mess mess

147
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,990
mess mess mess no it's not no no not

148
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,180
that

149
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,520
yes so you know that there is four on

150
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,180
C++ and that we can iterate over

151
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,280
collections but because the core is

152
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,300
write it in C our collection is actually

153
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,639
a linkedlist so writing in C and we have

154
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,849
up for each something for all of our

155
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:52,280
types and I have to use that it's a

156
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,549
macro

157
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,539
back back back back back back back back

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,289
so the car is not my responsibility

159
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,090
you did the car is responsibly from

160
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,910
Leno's and Dirk and I actually don't

161
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,220
want to touch the codes because well

162
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,060
there is a function there is around a

163
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,919
thousand and five hundred lines that I

164
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,660
could replace by three lines in C++

165
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,940
that's the reason that I don't want to

166
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,699
touch the car so I joined my work on the

167
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,789
interface and on the interface I did a

168
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,430
massive entanglement but I couldn't

169
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,279
really do what I wanted because both you

170
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,529
guys needed to co-exist for a while the

171
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,049
JDK should continue working and I had

172
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,479
shook creates the cutes based on the

173
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,149
same car so I couldn't really break

174
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,910
anything and as little changes as

175
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,290
possible in the car because the car

176
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,110
people are see and they still wanna you

177
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,740
see so I fix it the spaghetti codes and

178
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,950
now I had this I had a few classes that

179
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,529
mangle the top window the main window

180
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:03,320
the models for the data structure on the

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,160
C everything was done inside of the

182
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,220
interfaces now we have somewhat clear

183
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,779
and we see model for that there was one

184
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,390
file that had 15,000 lines that created

185
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,120
all of the graphs oh let me try to show

186
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,500
you this application because I'm not

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,820
sure if you guys know what I'm talking

188
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,880
about

189
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,810
that's where's the mouse help me hang

190
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,050
the mouse

191
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,649
so this is subservice and this is

192
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,540
basically one of my hobbies nowadays

193
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,089
after theater and tap dancing and

194
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,290
origami this graph here it has more than

195
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,779
seventeen different types of gravel

196
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,200
running here and this little part here

197
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,029
it's 200 lines of code usually the size

198
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,480
of this graph in the C code was around

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,660
15,000 lines but it only had six grabs

200
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,970
now it has 17 graphs and the size is the

201
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,779
same because we actually managed to

202
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,399
organize the code in a way that work it

203
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,690
and this is actually really cool if you

204
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,329
guys like to dive I have no idea what a

205
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,209
dive is I've done a diving lessons after

206
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,980
three months working on the system to

207
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,390
actually understand what the hell I was

208
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:49,589
doing this is a dive 200 meters and

209
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,899
going up slowly for more than 40 minutes

210
00:10:52,899 --> 00:11:00,959
yes microphone take it how are you

211
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,970
one two three

212
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,959
I would but I have a bigger problem than

213
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,899
that and you see in the lens of the

214
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:34,860
thingy where I was here so now the

215
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,589
application works we already have a lot

216
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,600
of users and it's working on a lot of

217
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
computers we have every programmer is on

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,569
Linux but the most user base is on

219
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,160
Windows which is a problem because we

220
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,439
have one windows developer that's not

221
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,970
paid to work and subsurface actually

222
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,319
nobody is actually paid to work on

223
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,480
subsurface we do it because we want to

224
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,730
try to see if we can scale in us and

225
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,920
make him Elias now remember this

226
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,899
interface how can we put that thing

227
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,110
inside of this it is too big

228
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,800
I mean

229
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,620
the interface is revolted there is a lot

230
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,839
of information there is no native code

231
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,300
area I mean we are using cute video gets

232
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,920
to three tickets we work on different

233
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,980
operating systems but it's not prepared

234
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,639
to work here it has a deep integration

235
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,379
with cute video cats I mean there is

236
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,509
buttons there is lists there is texts

237
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,699
there is everything here is acute

238
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,629
Wiggins

239
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:39,769
besides the the graph the graph it is my

240
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,100
code entirely and not a really good one

241
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,230
and there is a globe here that is pretty

242
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,379
and you don't need a globe if you're

243
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,209
trying to run this on a mobile because

244
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,120
on Android you already have the maps and

245
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,089
on iOS you also have the maps so we can

246
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,399
just remove this but the problems are

247
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,389
there is six tabs there that's too much

248
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,180
information there is seventeen possible

249
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,069
graphs here I cannot show seventeen

250
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,870
possible graphs here there is no space

251
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,069
and there is fifteen columns that you

252
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,699
can show on this list which is quite so

253
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,970
much as you can see this program was not

254
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,819
for arrow to run on a mobile and this

255
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,420
was a problem but we managed attributed

256
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,610
and we run it completely like that

257
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,389
inside of I don't remember the name of

258
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,550
the tablets but it was an entire block

259
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,720
and it run but well it was made for the

260
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,660
mouse it was hard to use it was made for

261
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,519
the mouse not fingers so you try to

262
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,259
click on one thing you click it on three

263
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,240
things at the same time it didn't felt

264
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,910
like a mobile application and the

265
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,339
dialogue the the files should be

266
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,009
reassured somehow some way and the

267
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,600
application didn't had access should

268
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,660
Android operating systems to actually

269
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,790
get the files because I'm riding iOS

270
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,339
they have some strange ways of having

271
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,889
the any fact that you want it's not

272
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,170
really like a UNIX based system or a

273
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,019
Windows or anything so which was its

274
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:18,160
workers but dealing really what work is

275
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,020
and enters liggett liggett is awesome

276
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,210
and I'm not sure if anyone here did that

277
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,820
because they didn't thought that this

278
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,220
was possible with kids but we are

279
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:38,180
actually using git as a file not as why

280
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,990
do you use guitar yes repository we are

281
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,180
not using it for a repository we are

282
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,790
using it as a file format which is

283
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,850
awesome because now we are stirring

284
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,280
everything in the gates not as a text

285
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,490
not as an XML file we are using git

286
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,090
storage information should save the life

287
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,520
which is right okay and it's fast and we

288
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,100
can apply dips over files and if we sink

289
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,590
something we can just do a git pull and

290
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,480
pull only the difference of the git

291
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,200
repository which is awesome because that

292
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,090
file that I open here on subsurface it

293
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,750
has 8 megabytes of data because the guy

294
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,210
that did those dives is just stupid and

295
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,950
he dives with four different live

296
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,900
computers should test the software yes I

297
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,040
still think that he is crazy

298
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,110
and that's Lee knows better but with git

299
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,210
we have a lot of things we can add

300
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,310
something and it can compare this so

301
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,630
it's really good for a programming

302
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,990
perspective because we can give the the

303
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,670
file format that it generated and it's

304
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,010
easy to spot regressions it's using to

305
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,520
improve you get repository for free so

306
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,380
you can send your dives to github and

307
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,290
then just get poked and you can use that

308
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,000
should get the files on the computer and

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,870
on the mobile and because of that we

310
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,150
created the subsurface cloud service

311
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,530
that is also free well it's free for the

312
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,030
users because Linux is paying for that

313
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,699
and the problems of youth really gets

314
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,549
that I said before it's proven it works

315
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:19,319
it will not crash it's really

316
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,459
lightweight I mean really really

317
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,349
lightweight for people that thinks that

318
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,199
cute is not like to it as gtk for

319
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,500
instance if you use the same stuff from

320
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,909
gtk and from kilts

321
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,490
they both will use the same amount of

322
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,250
memory on your computer so not really

323
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,580
different and it's used for another for

324
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,789
everything there is skin okay it can be

325
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,380
you can use the cord directly means that

326
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,510
I can call the C code that the code is

327
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,690
made of and I've done that I show that

328
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,870
before so I'm gonna just pull over that

329
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,190
enters KML people here do you know KML

330
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,000
two three four okay

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,389
quite much KML is something that you'd

332
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:06,450
created another long time ago was when

333
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,909
kids was social Nokia and then NACA so

334
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,620
to another company and then another

335
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,690
company split into other company how can

336
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,289
people trust that if the company is not

337
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,340
solids well you guys know Bentley right

338
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,530
Bentley uses Chanel

339
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,690
you guys know Tesla Tesla uses KML you

340
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,360
guys know Mercedes BMW they are starting

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,810
to use came out some song is using KML

342
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,480
so how can you trust a company that's

343
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,770
never really solid and stable I'm not

344
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,740
sure they do Terps for some reason and

345
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,260
one of the reasons is that this thing

346
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,320
can run everywhere on desktop on mobile

347
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,030
on KNX do you guys know KNX yep so Ken X

348
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,910
is one of the most used operating

349
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,810
systems for vehicles for cars and it's

350
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,940
being used currently on embedded systems

351
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,550
it's been used currently on airplanes on

352
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,910
cars on smartphones on drones on fridge

353
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,060
on boats and I actually did the first

354
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,610
drawn using he ml it was amazing I crash

355
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,969
at 3

356
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,090
III yes literally because when you have

357
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,680
the drunk and you have no idea how to

358
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,600
counter it well that was my first crash

359
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,180
and then I actually I put some

360
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,000
parachutes on it so it wouldn't actually

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,360
crash that way and on my job I had to

362
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,520
replace an art core and change it to

363
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,010
Intel I was into the developer so we

364
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,900
were trying to make the drone work on an

365
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,670
Intel chip the problem are the problems

366
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,800
Intel chip was choose low to actually do

367
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,210
the mathematical calculations that we

368
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,470
needed for the drone on the first trial

369
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,300
and it completely collapsed said when it

370
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,130
started to roll down on the sky and

371
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,530
crashes and the parachute didn't work it

372
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,330
because it tried to open but it was a

373
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,490
spinning just awesome we have the video

374
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,280
for that cam now started a long time ago

375
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,230
when this was considered that smartphone

376
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:25,730
this was yes it's working it was the

377
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,370
green phone thank you because I forgot

378
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,080
it was a little bit sluggish because we

379
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,320
didn't actually have the OpenGL work and

380
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
on that thing back back on the time but

381
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,600
it was the first trial of having

382
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,300
something declarative to work it uses

383
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,690
tilt wickets so it had a lot of

384
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,550
libraries to load it was a little bit

385
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,800
bloated but it work at it work at on OS

386
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,170
10 it work at on Linux Windows connects

387
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,400
Android iOS and now you remember

388
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,110
probably on university or when you guys

389
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,760
were starting your program or you'll

390
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,940
hurt this that Java is compiled ones run

391
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,300
everywhere but it's not because you have

392
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,030
Java say Java made Java something and

393
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,950
here you have actually a sequence plus

394
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,330
code that you can code once and run

395
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,220
everywhere you have to modify a little

396
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,890
thing here and there sometimes but it

397
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,330
usually works

398
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,250
and it's kimmel a language that runs on

399
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,480
top of v8 v8 is the library from chrome

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,880
to run JavaScript but it was a little

401
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,130
bit modified Shallotte small files

402
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,280
instead of big Java scripts and it also

403
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,860
uses a gift and it can interact directly

404
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,890
with cue object so you if you have in

405
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,730
your program a cube object you can just

406
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,900
pass it should deviate to the kml engine

407
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,060
and it can interact with it you can call

408
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,320
the properties you can call the

409
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,780
functions but it doesn't interact with

410
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,310
SiC codes now my whole core is in see

411
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,730
how the hell I'm gonna interact videos I

412
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,240
cannot so I need to do oh sorry

413
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,220
there is no drawing primitives on KML

414
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,080
which also bummer because if there is no

415
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,940
drawing primitives I cannot do the

416
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,160
profile the profile is the little fancy

417
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,820
graph honking now I can do rectangles

418
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,710
and I can do texts and I can do a

419
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,620
combination of rectangles and rekts for

420
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,690
real for real I don't have anything on

421
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,480
KML that is more than a combination of

422
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,660
rectangles and texts and maybe a pigs

423
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:42,480
map no you can't you can't load any kind

424
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,300
of cute' will get inside of came out

425
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
unless you go to c++ and you create a

426
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,270
new Cannell object that loads the pics

427
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,750
map for that we get ok so there is

428
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,560
nothing ready for that but it can

429
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,480
interact directly with two painter so

430
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,370
you could use cue painter for that but

431
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,370
is not really performance because it is

432
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,470
done in OpenGL and if you use cue

433
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,150
painter you are interacting actually

434
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,410
with pix maps and the act of sending a

435
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,810
pics web to OpenGL every frame is time

436
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,270
consuming and you can also use GES

437
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,550
canvas because Kimmel's butan top of Jas

438
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,050
and Jas has a converse you could use

439
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,030
that not performance don't do that

440
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,730
nobody does that don't don't even try to

441
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,370
do well actually we on KD we are doing

442
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,620
that

443
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,590
we have three libraries for that because

444
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,159
I only had two experiments and for a

445
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,559
desktop that's mostly okay but not from

446
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,720
Ohio mobile doesn't have the power as a

447
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,210
desktop has so we could not use that

448
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:52,130
because our graph is just too huge this

449
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,450
is painful so strict I've uses a double

450
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,890
link at least with shook pointers that

451
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,370
have a few other members as a sip

452
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,190
pointer that has a few macros to work on

453
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,610
it and we need to transform that on C++

454
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,679
object should troll this show the KML

455
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,570
and create a model because NVC and KML

456
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,870
are made should be used together

457
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,450
so let's duplicate the code and by

458
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,250
duplicating the code we actually managed

459
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,919
to make this work and now can now has

460
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,720
code to deal with dives and related

461
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,270
things because well we need to work with

462
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:37,490
knives but it was thankful but it works

463
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,190
this is an actual picture of the program

464
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,899
working on Android and it's even

465
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,570
blinking because it was really a lot of

466
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,130
work to make this work just choose

467
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,480
Summer of Code projects because the

468
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,000
first one the guy just gave up and never

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,610
answered our calls

470
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,520
yes not really good but we still had the

471
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,919
problem with the profile oh this is

472
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,309
using kirigami do you guys know kirigami

473
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:04,490
yep

474
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,549
so kirigami is a library that the KD

475
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,640
developers are building on top of kml to

476
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,710
make the application not use the device

477
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,140
specific information for vidiots we want

478
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,600
to use something five minutes okay I

479
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,928
need to run we need to

480
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,140
damn it I hate Iran we need to show the

481
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,870
application as a unity on everywhere

482
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,210
every device should have the same face

483
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,510
so we started to using Gmail kirigami

484
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,000
sorry but the profile was also problem

485
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,940
and we couldn't use the J's converse we

486
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,280
couldn't use the opengl by hands because

487
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,140
opengl by hand is just too painful and I

488
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,790
don't have the time to learn that if

489
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,430
anyone of you knows how to use opengl by

490
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,140
hand please help us

491
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,810
we had KD charts q charts and we could

492
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,670
try to export our current charts somehow

493
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,670
i tried to charts and key charts and

494
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,610
none of them working for what you want

495
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,680
because you were ready to talk about

496
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,430
this no current charting library had

497
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,320
what he had what do you wanted because

498
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,600
we wanted to put a lot of axes

499
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,310
overlapping on top of each other we

500
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,530
wanted to make them not really show

501
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,790
because we already have the information

502
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,510
on the curve we wanted to invert some

503
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,740
axis to show the graphs upside down and

504
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,020
it was hard to do that in a pretty way

505
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,370
using the currents things that we could

506
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,110
so we parted everything that we could

507
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:41,120
check email and the profile the cute way

508
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,840
to get the right order

509
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,030
how can you put a cutie will get we have

510
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,340
to write a C++ class and it's a little

511
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,650
bit of magic because we have to do this

512
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,870
bit of code just to make it show

513
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,150
correctly on the screen and I don't

514
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,280
think that you can read this it's not

515
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,490
made for reading is just because I want

516
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,470
to show you how we did it

517
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,380
and there is a lot of magic functions

518
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,970
there there is a lot of magic numbers

519
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,370
that we have no idea why they are there

520
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,390
but they seem to work yes and it work it

521
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,510
appeared and we are happy and these

522
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,700
applications actually running here in my

523
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,010
iOS that I can try to show you

524
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:27,290
ah this is the application I don't have

525
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,059
access to the data right now so I cannot

526
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,100
show you running that but it's loading

527
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,120
we still have a lot of coal don't see we

528
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,700
still have the lack of an actual KML

529
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,530
developer because I am a cute developer

530
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,410
cute with Achatz I've done 10 or 12

531
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,960
years of C++ development with cute for

532
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,929
the desktop my head doesn't works for ml

533
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:53,210
and we have a constant API breakage on

534
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,550
KML because we have cable controls one

535
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,020
true they are incompatible

536
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,210
we have kirigami one and true they are

537
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,190
compatible but they are using Gmail one

538
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,410
or two that are incompatible so we had a

539
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,080
lot of issues on that and it's hard

540
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,820
should get the documentation because

541
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,070
there is to creating it so so we need

542
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,980
more people please if you guys wanna try

543
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,050
to work with Windows and annoyed him

544
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,840
please join yes we need artists we need

545
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,520
testers we did divers preferably

546
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,889

might miss limbs and he will pay you a

549
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,309
dive someday

550
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:38,960
and questions sorry I don't have the

551
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,610
time I have a plane to catch right now

552
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,030
and in each one

553
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:54,649
in time which is more awesome so I think

I have one minute

555
00:28:55,609 --> 00:29:03,709
anyone has a question yes we look into

556
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,539
that but for that we need to know OpenGL

557
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,469
I have no idea OpenGL and you want the

558
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:17,760
fast people thank you very much
