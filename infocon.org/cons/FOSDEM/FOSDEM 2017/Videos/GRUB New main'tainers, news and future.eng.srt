1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,460
ah hello everybody i am vladimir zarubin

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,280
Anquan here is it is mark murray and

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,540
daniel and we would like to have a short

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,160
presentation about Grubb

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,990
it will be mostly in the foremost news

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,720
bulletins didn't what happened happened

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,200
like recently what what what do we what

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,810
is our outlook and a couple of other

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,890
things so first I think is that for

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,790
quite some time I I was the only active

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,339
maintainer of grab at first it was kind

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,160
of K because I was a student took quite

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
a lot of free time but then when I start

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,949
started working it first my cheese's is

15
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:51,089
and they started started working and it

16
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,069
was difficult time managed for a long

17
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,140
time we couldn't find and anybody else

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,199
who would want to want to become again

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,239
and simultaneously have the skills for

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,989
it and now fortunately we have three

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,530
people so it's really tional people the

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,000
first is Andrey he couldn't come then we

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
have Daniel and we have Alex born a chef

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,009
who also couldn't come second thing we

25
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,539
have two to zero to release going on now

26
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,229
we have already released the two zero to

27
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,140
do release candidate one so now we

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,680
accept only critical patches obviously

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,329
have a separate branch for new features

30
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,359
its branch called next but it's really

31
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,429
not a priority at this point to review

32
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:51,179
new features so if you send send a patch

33
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,729
for a new feature right now and we don't

34
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,469
respond timely it's not because we

35
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,469
ignore you is because we prioritize test

36
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,549
Gatens our release done and we expect to

37
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,289
have the release at the end of February

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,000
and we are we are not aware of any

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,770
release critical bugs in release

40
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,970
candidate 1 but we are all humans so

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,940
most likely there are bugs they're the

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,300
most likely release critical bugs and we

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,599
need help from you all all to find them

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,569
so far up your favorite machine your

45
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,230
favorite problematic machine and and run

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,799
it and report the bugs and the 2:02

47
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,569
release candidate 1 is available as a

48
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,980
tarball on on that address and

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,750
additionally it's also available as they

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,200
I mean as a get get cash you get tagged

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,970
in our repository what we have new we

52
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,180
have now new supported platforms

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,670
especially arm it for our movie it last

54
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,880
release we had nothing now we have you

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,220
have three flavors we have you boot

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,470
flavor our efi 32-bit AFI we have 64-bit

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,489
efi the is there is work in progress for

58
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,600
arm core boot but it's not in the part

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,519
of the release it's a separate branch

60
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,920
which probably will be merged so no not

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,690
not far from now but after the release

62
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,280
and we have sent para virtualized guest

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,959
which is great from security point of

64
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,090
view because this way of our system

65
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,060
parsing is listen and kernel person

66
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,420
everything happens in he pins in

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,109
unprivileged domain rather than doing it

68
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,690
in privilege domain or trying to get the

69
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,120
kernel somehow from unprivileged domain

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,730
to privilege domain then we have new

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,769
multi boot two features daniel can speak

72
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,290
more about them yeah it's quite

73
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,019
difficult because this quite a long

74
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,220
story and difficult so i was working on

75
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,358
zan at the beginning and when efi

76
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,810
appeared on the scene on many machines

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,780
hwa-jung bulik added efi support for zen

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,470
but it was simply a simple PE

79
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,770
application and configuration for Zen

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,060
was passed in a special separate txt

81
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,389
file so it means that it was quite

82
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,160
difficult for developers change

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,400
configuration during boot and grab -

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,680
allows you to edit configuration just

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
changes in the menu or something like

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,950
that so many many people asked for

87
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,940
support direct support and to have a

88
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,810
chance load then from grub - so I

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,460
started working on that and I quickly

90
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,750
realized that we need a new protocol

91
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,880
which is currently called multi boot

92
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,830
duvall - sorry but it boot - yeah I know

93
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,780
it happens so I took a look at it it was

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,350
in in grub available but unfortunately

95
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,020
there were two important features

96
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,930
missing one thing was that multiple -

97
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,229
was prepared for BIOS platforms so it

98
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,410
doesn't knew anything about efi and also

99
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,410
it wasn't able to pass efi information

100
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,919
EFI boot services a function - operating

101
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,510
system so we were needed to add special

102
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,080
options to pass this information from

103
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,020
efi directly to the US another thing

104
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,300
which we met is related to allocation of

105
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,900
memory on efi platforms many platforms

106
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,570
use low memory very low memory regions

107
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,289
to store runtime services boot services

108
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,370
and it means we cannot allow it for

109
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,780
example Zen image in

110
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,650
in a given region region because in Xan

111
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,650
this region is specified in in the

112
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,600
header so we we found out how to do that

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,460
we added self support for self rocket of

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,570
all images unfortunately we are not a we

115
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,810
haven't time to sub to add support for

116
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,060
ya Els relics yet but the frameworks

117
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,340
framework which is their al-assad so

118
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,800
currently working example of this

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,230
feature is available on the novel mining

120
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,660
list and I suppose that whole whole

121
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,610
working solution will be available in as

122
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,180
an upstream so that's it thank you and

123
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,280
of course we have added plenty of fixes

124
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,950
and then a couple of future plans and

125
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,450
ideas we have already the test test

126
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,370
framework for grabs that we use for

127
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,870
every release but Jim but the problem

128
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,970
that some of the tests require root is

129
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,669
they're basically FS tests they create a

130
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,830
create a file system of much using Linux

131
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,960
and then you try to read it using dry

132
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,380
rub we would like to make it work

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,340
without root then if we want to need to

134
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,470
have some kind of automatic system it

135
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,260
should regularly check grab tree risk so

136
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,180
we can find bugs quicker work in current

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,470
verification which will be the next

138
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:12,979
slide

139
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,960
and of course it's community project

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,410
objects so it's so it's it's driven by

141
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,500
the contributors as this and this

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,840
includes all of you everybody who wants

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,330
to participate for kernel verifications

144
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,640
there is now a lot of push of to have

145
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,940
some kind of ways to verify that the

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,120
kernel is what you expect it to be there

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,510
are different ways of doing it or

148
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,990
they're all back by different different

149
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,490
political groups they have

150
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,010
different purposes and so on and the

151
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,720
problems that we have at least three

152
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,240
different incompatible will Pudge said

153
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,540
already available GPG signature CPM and

154
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,029
efi secure boot via via shim so the

155
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,089
first one is already up streamed but the

156
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,720
second and the third one I I just a

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,940
patch on my mailing list and they're not

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,920
compatible between each other's father

159
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,540
ever so the idea is hm

160
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,950
after the release please I have a

161
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,680
separate branch which makes which as a

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,330
framework for a verifiers

163
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,700
and allows all the very far speed to

164
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,550
peacefully coexist and now Marie will

165
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,180
speak more about group mascot hello

166
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,490
everyone I would like to introduce a new

167
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,070
better version of group mascot when I

168
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,350
started to contribute to the project I

169
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,720
realized that this well-known project

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,230
has two loggers already but no one knows

171
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,339
it and I discussed this if you visa

172
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,920
maintainer and they agree that we need

173
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,290
something new and isn't noticeable so we

174
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,529
decided to make some nice-looking mascot

175
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,950
in my personal opinion animal mascots

176
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,339
are the best solution because there

177
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,220
really is noticeable and eye catching

178
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,260
of course everyone here I suppose know

179
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,310
the Linux talks penguin and he was a

180
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,700
kind of inspiration for me after the

181
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,070
discussion of his maintainer so we

182
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,399
decided that the creb would be nice and

183
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,470
I started drawing with this hand drawing

184
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,070
the main idea was a crab running

185
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,980
launching the balloon like operation

186
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,860
system there was some versions then we

187
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,940
made it not better in 2d then we try to

188
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,200
do it in three

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,660
and that's the final version right now

190
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,389
but it's now in a better-tasting stage

191
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,540
we found already a bond because many

192
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,230
people suppose it's that's a grab OS so

193
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,550
why and I see that we should do

194
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,630
something with that

195
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,810
that's not a grabbers it's a pure grub

196
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,810
I am a software engineer I'm not a

197
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,310
designer by my primary education by my

198
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,329
education so if you have some

199
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,510

200

something feel free to contact me I'm

201
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,779
not pretty sure should we do it in the

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,240

thanks a lot for your attention and we

226
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,620
are waiting for questions

227
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:31,430
yes for the question was how we support

228
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,309
nvm II

229
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,430
this depends on the platform if first of

230
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,790
all if if you use efi of bias and eyes

231
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,009
of them already supports and vm e then

232
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,220
graph will just just use them some grub

233
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,949
does not currently have a cover it's all

234
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,519
own nvme drivers first we have some own

235
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,470
hea Arta in satara drivers versa but

236
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,209
they're not used by default because it

237
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,579
would would conflict with bias or efi

238
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,120
they use by default on core boot on and

239
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,230
on the on bias you you can use you use

240
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,029
your own drivers for grub but currently

241
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,240
there is nothing for nvm e budgets but

242
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,459
basically patches are welcome and my

243
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,779
experience shows that part is that

244
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,540
drivers for grub actually much easier to

245
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,939
rides and drivers for fully fledged

246
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,930
operating system so right now we support

247
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,209
it on its true the only film we're

248
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:35,949
supports it yeah

249
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,540
for for touchscreen screen is every it's

250
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,560
an it's not currently supported but we

251
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,630
have all the underlines things that we

252
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,980
need we have we have you USB support we

253
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,500
have you have the support for graphical

254
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,870
menu from there it would actually be

255
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,230
pretty pretty easy to write touchscreen

256
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,190
support so if somebody wants wants to

257
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,920
write it just drop me an email and Kate

258
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,000
and I can give some guidance

259
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,660
