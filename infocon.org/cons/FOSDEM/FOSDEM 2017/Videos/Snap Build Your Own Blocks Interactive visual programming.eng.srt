[Music]

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,530
I

3
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,289
[Music]

00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,900
[Applause]

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,239
my name is Desmond I'm a researcher with

6
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,580
sa P and this is my friend and colleague

7
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,400
Bernard Roma Goza a researcher with

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,250
Arduino and we'll be presenting a

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,619
graphical programming language

10
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,780
that we're working on together with a

11
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,420
friend Brian Harvey who's a professor at

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,369
UC Berkeley and the language is called

13
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:29,770
snap which is kind of a generic name and

14
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,300
it's got the name build your own blocks

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,660
so what is snap about Snap is anybody

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,789
know scratch the language scratch

17
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,970
scratch awesome you all just know

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,509
scratch anybody know snap okay great so

19
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm gonna show you something new okay

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,890
snap has been created for a new course

21
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,560
at UC Berkeley that's in place now for

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,810
six years they replace the old

23
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,270
cs10 course which is the the

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,770
introductory computer science course for

25
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,950
non CEA's majors with the new course

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,869
that's called the beauty and joy of

27
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,258
computing and you know just changing the

28
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,910
name and switching over to a language

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,209
that is more accessible has kind of you

30
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,830
know attracted more underrepresented

31
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
minorities to the course so for the

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,640
first time in in UC Berkeley history

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,099
actually the course has a higher number

34
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,010
of females than males in that course and

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,440
that's partly because it formerly it was

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,319
named introduction to a symbolic

37
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,890
programming and so names matter and

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,000
accessibility is something that is not

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,890
just you know for disability issues but

40
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,860
also for regular people so the

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,870
development of snaps that has been for a

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,629
long time kind of my side project as I

43
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,459
was a programmer in the lower 404

44
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,709
another company but then we got kind of

45
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,480
lucky we got some funding from the

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,360
National Science Foundation we got

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,300
my employers to kind of fund it and let

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
me work on a demure soft and now ASAP

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,340
and Y Combinator also there's a

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,230
curriculum the beauty and joy of

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,430
computing curriculum that's been

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,840
developed at UC Berkeley and now at

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,910
nationwide at education Development

54
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,500
Center and it's also an APCs principles

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,790
course that's the kind of new kind of

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,040
course in the United States that's sort

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
of like a centralized standardized

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,860
course for the big ideas in computer

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,550
science and BJC the acronym probe user

60
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,070
of computing is part of that as one of

61
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,020
these courses and since october

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,400
announces that a semester

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
we're kind of dissipating nationwide

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,530
there's a MOOC and LU kinetics that's

65
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,010
and there's a project to bring this

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,770
course to 100 high schools in New York

67
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,090
City and we've been working with them

68
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,910
for the last year and they're kind of

69
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,890
using this course and also using this

70
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,220
language so why we're here it's web

71
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,000
browser based it's pure HTML Javascript

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,290
so it runs in the browser it doesn't

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,450
have to be installed which is a problem

74
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,709
the schools of you try to install

75
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,200
software sometimes they won't let you

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,260
it's been translated right now to do 39

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,299
languages most European languages but

78
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,890
also summation once it's of course free

79
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,150
Libre an open source so it's all on

80
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,798
github you can fork it and people that

81
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,608
forked it a lot there's also a free

82
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,370
cloud service so you can so kids can you

83
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,770
know in school start a project and then

84
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,260
continue working at home by you know

85
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,479
just logging into the cloud or or keep

86
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,900
working on it on their iPads and as use

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,940
as a teaching and research platform and

88
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,060
many institutions so or colleague Brian

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,690
Harvey could this turn that snap which

90
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,560
is our language is basically skiing but

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,630
it looks like scratch so what does it

92
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,350
mean

93
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,020
so from scratch we're taking you know

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,660
these blocks that stick together that

95
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,040
prevent syntax errors

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,240
that look inviting we've got the 2d

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,170
cartoonish microworld

98
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,870
or their sprites that can move around

99
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,250
against a backdrop which is called the

100
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,640
stage we've got you know the the

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,710
parallelism from from scratch where are

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,840
things to go at the same time you didn't

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,670
have to think at the level of tics in

104
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,220
order to make things but you have actual

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,750
you know threads and processes and it's

106
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,770
the most important things it's

107
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,530
interactive it's constantly live there

108
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,050
is no compiling run cycle wherever you

109
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,670
click on the block it you know it

110
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,710
immediately happens and I'm gonna show

111
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,620
some of that liveness which is important

112
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,910
to make something self discoverable

113
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,980
Google how does it work just try it you

114
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,170
know in a safe environment so this makes

115
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,020
for a low floor as we say it's it's it's

116
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,860
an easy access it gets you started but

117
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,250
it's also skiing and this guy's dress so

118
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,320
from skiing we're taking the ability to

119
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,140
you not just use the blocks that we gave

120
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,360
you but also it's an extensible language

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,980
you can build your own box you could

122
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,050
boot any blocks somebody I mean you can

123
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,820
even book kind of control structures

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,080
it's dynamically typed so so we've got

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,290
heterogeneous data structures and we

126
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,430
lexically scoped variables which kind of

127
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,980
allows us to to kind of do computer

128
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,840
science you know we have some

129
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,490
first-class stuff including first-class

130
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,040
lists lists of lists that allow us to

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,710
build any model any data structures and

132
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,770
we've got a way to think about blocks

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,090
using blocks which is essentially lambda

134
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,770
so so we've got lambda and lambda

135
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,950
capturing non-local state of variables

136
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,290
and that also allows us to not just

137
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,910
model a new data structure but to model

138
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,010
any control structure basically kind of

139
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,690
build your own programming language in

140
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,820
blocks and we've got some fun stuff like

141
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,560
first best continuations just because

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,630
we're talking about skiing which kind of

143
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,800
allows us to build our own like break

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,250
things and and non-local exit control

145
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,570
structures and

146
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,320
because we're encouraging students to

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,210
use this language to with their own

148
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,820
control structures we have proper tail

149
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,440
recursion so so they can model it

150
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,960
recursively because that's a powerful

151
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,170
idea to think about and to learn so so

152
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,660
this is basically the old battle cry of

153
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,670
the no-go community right so because the

154
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,490
know for but we have no ceiling we do

155
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,900
have a seating you know technically you

156
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,490
can't do everything with snap but

157
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,860
conceptually anything and everything

158
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,150
that you can express in a programming

159
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,920
language we want to be able to express

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,860
in this kind of you know kids looking

161
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,640
like language so there's some other

162
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,230
things that we you know took from other

163
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,150
environments that inspired us like smart

164
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,550
our logo and themself so we've got more

165
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,370
first class stuff we've got more ways to

166
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,760
work with a date we've got wet API so so

167
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,410
kids can play with the robots and drones

168
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,930
and and stuff it's extensible with

169
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,120
JavaScript so you got a way to kind of

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,610
write your own blocks and even if you

171
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,530
know it doesn't exist yet if you need

172
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,940
primitives we can transpile and compile

173
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,860
the blocks to other languages so we can

174
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,780
embed it on you know literally robots

175
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,760
because some some of these like Oh

176
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,000
totally knows they really enjoy having

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,430
their sketches kind of natively because

178
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,530
they're low powered machines and we can

179
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,920
deploy these things as native apps also

180
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,559
and this is basically what we call wider

181
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,450
wall so these are the three dimensions

182
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,370
that we talk about it no floor no entry

183
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,309
no ceilings so you can stick to you know

184
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,650
snap do your PhD and snap but there's

185
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,270
also a wide variety of things that

186
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,460
there's usually more than one way to do

187
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,380
one thing so it's so we're very

188
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,490
encouraging people not just to figure

189
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,140
this is the right way you can do it but

190
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,790
they're different ways and they should

191
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,829
all work so oh yeah let me show you

192
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,720
okay good

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,629
what's happening I don't get my Mac so

194
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,779
this is anybody seen this this is their

195
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,740
the project that started it all it's

196
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,100
called V and what this is is it's

197
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,019
another project and and here's an

198
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,720
example of a custom block and this is

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,519
how we define the block V so on the

200
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,490
stage what we have is every scratch kid

201
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,189
will identify as at least watcher it's

202
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:33,699
it's a list only in the list there are

203
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,829
blocks and this is something provocative

204
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,779
this is something scratch doesn't give

205
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,600
you so here we have this function V and

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,949
I've kind of slowed it down to see what

207
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,509
happens so I'm just going to let this

208
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,769
run so just kind of slowly you can see

209
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:48,550
what it does

210
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,769
it'll kind of you know turn left move a

211
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:53,680
little and then run any of these blocks

212
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
in the list go back to and write run

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,639
another any of these blocks let me just

214
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,649
make it a little faster by turning off

215
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,779
visible stepping so I can run this a

216
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,790
couple of times and I get some random

217
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,850
ends and now the question that we ask

218
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,779
kids and this is actually how we kind of

219
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,050
know what happens now so now I just

220
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,019
pressed a button and there are two V

221
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,639
blocks in that list so what will happen

222
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,429
there by now running this procedure any

223
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,640
idea any guesses

224
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,340
double ww2 dears let's just ride I'm

225
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,270
just gonna click this there's kind of

226
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,490
some random shapes sometimes they just

227
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,610
do that though sometimes it would kind

228
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,550
of really go crazy so we're getting you

229
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,560
know a fractal because we can now kind

230
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,900
of you know call itself and the reason

231
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,640
why it doesn't go on forever like it

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,500
could go on forever did you know the

233
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,270
reason is it's just some statistical

234
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,830
probability it's not going to actually

235
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,510
go on forever and the beautiful thing

236
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,000
about you know this is we're showing two

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,580
big ideas and this is what the beauty is

238
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,720
you have computing is about we're

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,700
showing two big ideas in this thing it's

240
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,450
a list of procedures that's procedures

241
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,090
data procedures data is traditionally

242
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,370
considered something to be very

243
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,830
difficult to understand for beginners

244
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,580
especially but it's kind of a

245
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,670
visualization that's easy for even

246
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,770
scratched kids to get procedures data

247
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,130
and the other way is we're introducing

248
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,410
recursion right something that will call

249
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,630
itself and the beautiful example of this

250
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,430
is it doesn't even have to have a base

251
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,810
case because the base case it's just

252
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,650
math so this is kind of the arc your

253
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,170
typical example let me just show you a

254
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,750
few things we haven't snapped is for

255
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,240
example three plus four and you know if

256
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,190
I click on this I'm immediately getting

257
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,040
an example so I so I can try this but I

258
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,990
can also prevent this from being

259
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,120
evaluated by putting it inside the

260
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,010
reaming so now it's kind of you know

261
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,960
protected against being evaluated and

262
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,240
then I can go and I can call it again

263
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,630
and now if I call it I'm getting getting

264
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,470
seven so why is this interesting

265
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,350
and I can kind of call it with a

266
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,650
parameter and I'm getting aid so this is

267
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,660
you know I can package something and I

268
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,360
can unpack it again and that's seemingly

269
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,640
trivial but what this actually allows us

270
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,610
to do is higher order functions we can

271
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,790
pass on the block and evaluated familiar

272
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,130
so we can buy their own high order

273
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,900
functions so here's a map and this is

274
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,830
how a map is defined and we can take map

275
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,540
and for example have a list you know

276
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,290
just one two three four list an app that

277
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,160
times to function over this and begin a

278
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,620
list where each item has been

279
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,030
transformed or we can have since this is

280
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,700
firstly we can have any function in

281
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,460
there now this is going to be the square

282
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,310
function we can put in the function that

283
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,000
makes a list and we get you know a list

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,850
of lists whose first item is the square

285
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,370
of the input number or we can kind of go

286
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,310
even crazier and make a list of lists of

287
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,720
lists which kind of turns out to be a

288
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,170
table so with these simple seemingly

289
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,300
simple features we can do pretty

290
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,460
powerful things and in computing and so

291
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,980
this is really what the beauty and joy

292
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,280
of computing kind of was all about so um

293
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,260
we show you just just one more example

294
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,390
of this very quickly so this is supposed

295
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,340
to be the building in which we are the

296
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,960
weather isn't so great so I took resolve

297
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,570
the web my own when didn't have enough

298
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,100
colors so here's an example of

299
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,810
first-class stuff so we've got kind of

300
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,820
this first-class costume and I can look

301
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,570
at the pixels in that costume and so I'm

302
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,160
getting a table you know it's kind of

303
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,370
almost fifty six thousand rows of you

304
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,209
know

305
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,670
four columns and obviously these are the

306
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,309
rgba columns and so it's just a list

307
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,259
it's just a list of lists so if it's

308
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,369
just a list of lists

309
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:35,209
I can take my map thing and do something

310
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,290
with it so I'm just gonna you know put

311
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,779
the first item of the list and the

312
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,910
second slot put the second in the third

313
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,459
slot put the third in the first slot and

314
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:57,999
and leave the last one which is the VA

315
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,240
where it is

316
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,600
so this is a function I'm gonna put this

317
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,019
function into map and see what happens

318
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,970
and it's gonna take a little while but

319
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,240
here it is and that can compare these

320
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,220
two tables and if I look at the first

321
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,250
number see this is 8400 2200 for now

322
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,649
it's kind of rearranged right it's just

323
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,269
data see what happens if I can redisplay

324
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,800
this data what's gonna happen to the

325
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,629
blue sky graphic effects it's just high

326
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,620
order functions this is just map this is

327
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,670
to us what the beauty and joy of

328
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,350
computing is all about I'm gonna leave

329
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,339
it here to hand over to my colleague

330
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,300
Bernardo Mikasa who's going to show you

331
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,000
kind of some more concrete things to do

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,839
with Arduinos and with 3d product

333
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,470
so basically you know it's ten servers

334
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,980
to do a live demo it's even more

335
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,750
dangerous when you have Hardware

336
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,110
involved and I swear to god this was

337
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,550
working last week so I'll try it again

338
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,250
if you don't work ten minutes ago

339
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,990
it might not work now let's try it here

340
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,839
is I have exactly the same snap

341
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,879
environment only that it's a modified

342
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,490
version of snap that lets you interact

343
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,370
with Arduino boards okay so the first

344
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,470
thing you do is you connect to the

345
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,939
Arduino board which I have here it tells

346
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,850
me it's been connected and now I have a

347
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,009
couple I have a sensor here and I have

348
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:56,800
an LED here I'll try to be really fast

349
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,290
so I can try to get the analog reading

350
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,069
of the pin where the sensor is connected

351
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:06,470
if I press on it I'll get a value she

352
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,839
looks exactly like snap no difference so

353
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,069
let me try to plot this

354
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,890
to plot something we need to have a

355
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,819
sprite moving one step all the time

356
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,990
right and basically when the exposition

357
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,070
goes over

358
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:41,970
the edge of the stage I want it

359
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,110
to set to the other edge right

360
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,220
okay what do I have to do with the white

361
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,050
position I have to map it to the value

362
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,250
of the sensor right so we'll just set Y

363
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:08,140
to the value of the sensor put the pen

364
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,510
down now

365
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,500
and of course I'll need to clear the

366
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,429
stage when when the spider gets out of

367
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,360
stage right so if now if this was

368
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,929
waiting now you'd see my heartbeat would

369
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:29,050
you kind of do kind of and I can also

370
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,960
map these two again the real world and

371
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,780
in the real world I have this led that

372
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,360
would be me making my heartbeat if it

373
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,050
always working out because these are

374
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,800
very sensitive sensors and they

375
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,380
sometimes need to be under a bit of

376
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,470
pressure and in in darkness so I'll try

377
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,530
to

378
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:11,230
apply some pressure any kind of ice well

379
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,020
it's my heartbeat so what we can do is

380
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,120
I'll show you a one-minute video

381
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,570
so this is a heart rate monitor

382
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,110
this led by the way this hurt has been

383
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,029
coded in a language that's another

384
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,590
modification of snap called little

385
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,120
blocks so the whole thing is made with

386
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,549
blocks here I'm trying to get my heart

387
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,019
pumping I'm not very much in shape so we

388
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,960
just took around 10 seconds and you can

389
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,850
see that the graph did actually work I

390
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,360
mean I didn't fake it I swear I think I

391
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,529
kind of broke the sensor by pulling the

392
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:15,210
cables I don't know so to finish the

393
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,250
presentation I want to show you what

394
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,750
this heart looks like in metal blocks

395
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,850
these little blocks and basically it's

396
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,210
the same thing as a snap but now you

397
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,639
have a 3d world here and you have a

398
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,830
beetle that receive your instructions

399
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,270
okay so I can for instance have it

400
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,040
we eat something 24 times and creators

401
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,620
feel behind it okay you know this is

402
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,280
once I have my shape I can download it

403
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,770
as an STL and print it in a 3d printer

404
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,830
or as an obj and use it in my game okay

405
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,570
and Cynthia snap you can have your own

406
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,820
procedures you can have your own more

407
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,730
complicated blocks like for example this

408
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,640
block that I built that generates a

409
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,440
heart shape

410
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,890
I of course copied this from Wikipedia I

411
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,160
look for a function that grows a shape I

412
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,790
don't know the first thing about

413
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,460
mathematics and let me show you how it

414
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,640
works

415
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,980
now it wasn't in turbo mode but

416
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,960
basically the idea here is that blocks

417
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,700
programming is seamless programming and

418
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,160
you can do pretty much everything and I

419
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,900
know if we have time for questions I

420
00:21:43,900 --> 00:22:00,550
think yeah okay consider I actually used

421
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,970
to teach kids with scratch and it worked

422
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,910
really well but like after a while they

423
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,170
just kind of grew out of it like they

424
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,020
hit some wall I could tell Snap is more

425
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,520
powerful but have you considered at some

426
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,800
point offering a way to transition the

427
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,910
text-based programming even it was kind

428
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,420
of like scheme

429
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,489
okay there's a question like what's the

430
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,669
strategy to transition to progressed

431
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,009
from block space coding into text based

432
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,259
coding and I've kind of given talks on

433
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,599
this the other way around like how do

434
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,129
you progress from text based code to

435
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:46,200
blocks based code so you gotta watch out

436
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,019
for the motivation behind this so once

437
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,269
you realize that you know working with

438
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,580
blocks in a live environment you're

439
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,299
actually working at the ast level of a

440
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,340
programming language you're actually

441
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,909
modifying a script as it is running this

442
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,179
is something no text-based language will

443
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,609
let you do it will there's a live coding

444
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,739
languages but they were only you know

445
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:13,349
refresh after the next loop they reset

446
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,509
it and restart you know any music

447
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:16,619
they'll do do you know what the next

448
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,330
beat or at the next bar so

449
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,460
conceptionally I think we all know that

450
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,749
takes place programming works I mean

451
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,059
that's everybody I mean this is coded in

452
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,649
tech space JavaScript you know

453
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:30,960
underneath but conceptually there's no

454
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,179
necessity conceptually there are

455
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,549
interesting things if you take blocks to

456
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,340
the extreme as we are and there are

457
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,859
really two things about about text-based

458
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,169
programming that well three first is

459
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,529
because my dad is using it right so I

460
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,960
keep telling kids you know but your

461
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,929
dad's boss you know she's using snap you

462
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,690
know well maybe at some point hopefully

463
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,409
and the other way is there are issues of

464
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:04,859
course with the we're looking up blocks

465
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,409
of the palette so this works great for

466
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,169
you know 120 bucks but if you've got you

467
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,849
know a thousand and twenty four blocks

468
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:14,340
and how are you even gonna find them so

469
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,379
I could show you some more but we've

470
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,840
built something into snap that lets you

471
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,389
type blocks so you this so there's a

472
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,039
typing mode and you can just start

473
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,659
typing and then you get all the bar and

474
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,549
and and and with just a few keystrokes

475
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,220
you kind of assemble a script and I've

476
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,859
been very inspired to do this and

477
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,720
basically to the point of almost copying

478
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,609
it from Greenfoot from micro culling in

479
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,770
the ground

480
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,470
there are new frame based editing as

481
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,560
they're calling it stride editor has

482
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,210
been a great source of inspiration to

483
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,450
type more complex things so so you don't

484
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,070
have to use the mouse to drag the W no

485
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,140
to start with the control palette then

486
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,510
go and if they go to the operators

487
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,400
palette drag out you know and keep

488
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,320
switching so your if you already know

489
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,220
where there's something like that you

490
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,650
can type it faster that's kind of one of

491
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,050
the main things for power
