1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,679
thank you better okay

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:15,558
I have to do this okay openness

3
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:23,630
innovation and opportunity and it has to

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,130
be like a key part of everything we do

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,200
we can't do anything alone we're simply

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,599
not big we're strong enough but the

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,309
realities of day-to-day life is that

8
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,230
when the teams are shipping code and

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,399
things need to be fixed

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,010
sometimes this aspect of openness can

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,140
seem like it gets more tedious than it

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:48,220
gets effective in working in open ways

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,260
and so we really wanted to understand

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,390
how we create a better experience and

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,220
that's a better experience of people who

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,989
want to contribute to the Solaris

17
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,149
mission and the stuff that we do but

18
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,680
it's also a better experience for the

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:09,560
people in design and UX world that we

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,999
start off by understanding people's

21
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:11,479
needs

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,219
so there are motivations why do they do

23
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,689
something because when we understand

24
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,090
that we can design better experiences

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,520
for them so that was the ground kind of

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,649
idea of this project is really how do we

27
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,149
create a better experience for

28
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,619
contributors who want to help with

29
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,799
Mozilla's mission around the world a

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,909
really good way of starting to

31
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,679
understand people's motivation is to ask

32
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:35,779
them so we had a lot of interviews 26 in

33
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:40,270
in total that were between an hour

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:03:28,120
we did these interviews that we focused

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,489
on their stories so it was a lot about

36
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,500
getting them to tell us stories so that

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,630
we could understand how they first got

38
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,970
involved was the things that kind of

39
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,680
motivated them to get in go but also

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,330
telling your stories about when things

41
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,800
have been really good like what were the

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,209
things that were happening when this was

43
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,350
really good what were the things that

44
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,470
were happening when this is really bad

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,000
from a kind of social science

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,710
perspective if we do that because once

47
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,870
we get people to story tell we can

48
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,770
normal as they have so the story

49
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,830
[Music]

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:27,900
interesting for the and he was and how

51
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:35,370
he moved forward in his career making

52
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,230
sure that everyone had access to the

53
00:04:50,510 --> 00:05:26,430
different areas that we saw and it

54
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,919
continues the project

55
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:46,729
it's like having a it's like having this

56
00:05:46,729 --> 00:06:04,310
kind of it was taking part in something

57
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,360
that was bigger than themselves

58
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,379
when I say that to my friends and so I

59
00:06:27,379 --> 00:07:00,710
will do it and the way we share

60
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,080
knowledge that hopefully we all believe

61
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,940
fosters innovation in some form and

62
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:17,360
having a key part of why people really

63
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,279
stay is the ongoing recognition that

64
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,500
happens and again this can be very

65
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,589
different as we've talked about here for

66
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,509
starters when you're just starting out

67
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,430
like something like a stickers ride can

68
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,860
be immensely important to just show your

69
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,789
relationship but once you get language

70
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,930
contributors and Lamberton relationships

71
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,639
it really is about the kind of tacit

72
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,169
recognition that happens within the

73
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,609
group and within the community as well

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,030
interesting here's one of the guys who

75
00:07:47,030 --> 00:09:01,130
was that guy and so the way we make sure

76
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,080
that we look at these different

77
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,850
motivations is that we cross through

78
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,360
them things that look like and this is

79
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,490
complex right like it's not like one

80
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,590
person is just inspired by learning and

81
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,210
the other person is just inspired by

82
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,340
recognition so the way that we try to

83
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,140
kind of minimize the complexity in this

84
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,720
which is in social science what we call

85
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,790
a bit of a finger and air exercise but

86
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,230
tends to work is that we took each

87
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,580
individual's we talked to and on each of

88
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,440
the scales of these five motivations we

89
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,540
gave them the score from one to ten so

90
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,220
what is most important what is least

91
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,030
important for them

92
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,279

93

[Music]

94
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:28,740
that's it's much easier for them and

95
00:10:28,740 --> 00:11:20,130
that's why I was like my teacher had

96
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,570
said you need to be part of deaf

97
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,120
communities and this young female had no

98
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,490
idea what that meant and social deaf

99
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,350
communities and open source came up and

100
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,270
hence she got involved and has now been

101
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,160
like a contributor for five years so

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,320
sometimes it's it's very random kind of

103
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,900
ways that they get into it but maybe

104
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,460
it's so that they can build up their

105
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,709
skills and networking and

106
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,559
get things that they can put on their CV

107
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,749
and show and move their careers forward

108
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:48,660
with however they stay in open-source

109
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,819
because they get enticed by the

110
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,709
community and they get enticed by that

111
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,509
recognition and status that they can get

112
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:44,660
when they have being able to say you

113
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,209
[Music]

114
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:18,600
know I just one of those things and

115
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,850
open-source is a way for them to get

116
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,230
that with more people but they stay

117
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,920
because this is really ongoing source of

118
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,660
learning for them they feel like they

119
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,689
can keep like up in the polls I don't

120
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,399
know how you say that but they can keep

121
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,049
up to date and they can learn new things

122
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:46,160
and this is the citizens and

123
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,729
[Music]

124
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:27,210
because they care about their just being

125
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:39,720
able to do this and seeing this what

126
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:55,290
this means because happening is that we

127
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:07,760
sat down with does this mean for you

[Music]

129
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,010
some general trends that pretty much

130
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:27,540
every open source was this idea of

131
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:35,250
showcasing the value exchange reviews is

132
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,380
because it's super important the key

133
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,900
things that we saw we talked to people

134
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,760
is that in the beginning of their

135
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,120
engagement with communities they didn't

136
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
really understand the benefits to the

137
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,140
full extent that they do when they're

138
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,190
involved so when they

139
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,190
okay

a site that basically gives people a

144
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,569
better an idea of what can I like

145
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:23,750
contribute to what can I do to see where

146
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,119
people are that you can different

147
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,640
projects

149
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,090
make a difference for the mission and

150
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,620
this is basically focused a lot

151
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,210
obviously on the kind of citizen group

152
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,370
that we talked about but this idea of

153
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,040
highlighting that Messiah is obviously

154
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,140
about but we do a lot of other things

155
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,080
like that literacy like working on

156

171
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,719
[Music]

172
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,980
[Music]

173
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,220
you understand why so we're using us to

174
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,610
understand why

175
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,830
using the quants to go back and look at

176
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,870
the how and canvas actually be

177
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,850
replicated in large scale can we see

178
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,170
this back in the survey and that's how

179
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,440
we're doing

180
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:05,000
[Music]

181
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,680
[Music]

182
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,260
so that's my mo because they're looking

183
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,540
for interviews and it's gonna do more of

184
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,990
these as well

185
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,279
frustration yeah so the question was if

186
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,590
we've looked into the negative blog post

187
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,090
or on add-ons to understand more about

188
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,500
how the community is feeling right now

189
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,870
and the answer that is that Mallika is

190
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,320
also running some like basic content

191
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
scraping to understand sentiment

192
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
analysis online so we'll probably

193
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,909
appealing that but again reach out to

194
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:40,380
her to understand more about how she's

195
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,889
doing

196
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,359
[Music]

197
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:15,250
I couldn't and did you ask what inspired

198
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:24,460
us to get involved yeah so we did in the

199
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,929
beginning of this reach out to quite a

200
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,460
few different open source communities

201
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,929
because we wanted to talk to people from

202
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:35,679
from different areas doing anything to

203
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,090
say we haven't reached out by any means

204
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,919
to all of them and that is probably

205
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,179
something that we should consider but we

206
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:58,750
haven't done that the side with the the

207
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,900
URL

208
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,589
