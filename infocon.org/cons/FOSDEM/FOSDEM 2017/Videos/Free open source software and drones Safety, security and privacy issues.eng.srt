1
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:44,850
that's just his lecture and making put

2
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,350
on the mic because that's is not being

3
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:56,310
streamed so can you see me the questions

4
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,750
of the audience because nobody can hear

5
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:24,330
it as well yeah okay I still have to

6
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,090
keep on shouting precision farming which

7
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,180
is a very important very important use

8
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,210
you can use sensors you can use not only

9
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,660
of course images or but you can use many

10
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,510
sensor many kind of different sensors in

11
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,510
order to in order to have really good

12
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,860
outcome in precision in precision

13
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
farming and then of course fantasy you

14
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,250
limit you can use for try and find

15
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,950
poachers in as they do as they do in

16
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,830
Africa or you can use drones for

17
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,590
checking damages in planes as they do it

18
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,270
in as easyJet is doing and then then you

19
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,680
can do many many things last January so

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,140
last month

21
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,048
Qualcomm started presentation with

22
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,108
autonomous drones with interact with

23
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,840
with the environment and they are able

24
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,260
to move in any environment even in in a

25
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,300
closed amount of environment without GPS

26
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,030
of course using machine learning and

27
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,700
artificial intelligence so you can have

28
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,870
different

29
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,690
I mean fantasy is your limit technically

30
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,410
you can do almost almost everything

31
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,620
and the drones are very useful for dirty

32
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,290
dull and dangerous operations where no

33
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,990
human can be involved and they can do it

34
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,360
without without any problem but there

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,100
are some drone risks

36
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,760
I won't go very very long into them but

37
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,360
of course peeping drones this is just

38
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,330
one example drones are a fantastic tool

39
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,030
for invading people's privacy we have to

40
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,400
keep in mind and we we we think about

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,890
later and then there is another risk I

42
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,380
won't show you the video but you can

43
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,800
search it online this is a fantastic

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,290
video of a couple who decided to have

45
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,540
his best moments filmed on drones and

46
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,360
the drone just crashes into the bride

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,060
into into the groom so you can have a

48
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,240
look at it but it's just just a risk but

49
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
what about drones and and Falls why

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,130
should why should we have to talk about

51
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,200
it we should have to talk about it

52
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,480
because free and open-source software is

53
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,690
really become it is the core of drones

54
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,690
we have the drone the drone code the

55
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,660
open-source UFO platform which is the

56
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,490
drone called Project is an open source

57
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,800
and collaborative project which is which

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,490
has been found in 2000 2000 and and 14

59
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,480
and it has many members now it has one

60
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,690
less member we will talk about in in a

61
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,910
while but it is still a very very

62
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,120
important and backed by by the Linux

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,420
Foundation and the autopilot the peaks

64
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,110
for pro is another it's in an

65
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,150
independent open hardware and open soft

66
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,610
and see an open-source software is

67
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,360
licensed on a BSD license but one one

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,330
library as far as I as a remember but

69
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,910
there are there are already some

70
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,880
problems with every community has this

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,970
easy thorns and also the drone code

72
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,790
community has this problem and a couple

73
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,660
of months ago there has been a problem

74
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,080
an ardupilot I guess many of you know

75
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,830
about our group IO decided to live drone

76
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,700
code on

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,980
okay decided decided to live to live

78
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,180
drunk old because of a change of policy

79
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,240
or so so they say with regard to

80
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,290
licensing ardupilot is a gplv3 project

81
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,490
and wanted to say like that while on the

82
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,810
other hand it seems that a general or so

83
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,980
this so it is to be understood by by

84
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,960
what the press statements say that the

85
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,730
other project wanted to focus on a more

86
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,800
different or a different license or more

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,400
present permissive change of microphone

88
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
yes

89
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,740
I'm not sure so just check on the camera

90
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:49,410
to keep different licenses permissive

91
00:08:49,410 --> 00:09:02,550
license and take a look for yourself I

92
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,040
have just one one comment if you read

93
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,260
the bylaws of drunk old

94
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:50,709
which we have another talk about that a

95
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:59,500
protection just put the main problem and

96
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
I will leave it to the other speak and

97
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,970
to deal and to deal on or can use this

98
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,100
one too because for the rich I'm sorry

99
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,660
well Mike yeah it's for the moment is

100
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,209
gonna be like that sorry okay

101
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,660
do we have any more mics come on come on

102
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,079
I want to be recorded talking about data

103
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,540
protection I want to be recorded just in

104
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,959
full okay what about data protection if

105
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,630
you want to have a good idea about data

106
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,149
protection drones start with the opinion

107
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,050
125 of the article 29 working party this

108
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,930
was before the data protection

109
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,410
regulation but it is still very

110
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,089
interesting documented it is strange

111
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,860
enough a short one that makes you

112
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,190
understand the dollar problem but let's

113
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,680
deal with the new regulation just a

114
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,170
couple a couple of remarks the ear

115
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,709
regulation will enter is already has

116
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:58,810
already been published but it will enter

117
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,800
into force next year in May so just if

118
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,839
you are doing a business plan on drones

119
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,310
you have to you have to take into

120
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,890
consideration of course and what are the

121
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,260
main points one point is very important

122
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,790
when it when it comes to drones its

123
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,300
transparency you have to make the

124
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,500
persons aware that you using a drone

125
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,570
nearby you have to make aware of that

126
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,690
and you you can you Buick you have to be

127
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,430
make people aware all

128
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,070
so in a machine-readable way so you have

129
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,410
to think how to implement it and then

130
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,450
you have to use icons this is one of the

131
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,870
icons I found to to know to let people

132
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,270
know that you're maybe filming with a

133
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,670
drone around maybe this would do of

134
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,589
course this won't be the iPhone that

135
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,390
will be implemented for telling people

136
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,480
that the drone is flying nearby but

137
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,760
let's become a little more serious and

138
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,459
and consider some key concept of the ear

139
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,130
regulation which are very important for

140
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,279
developing every kind of aspect with

141
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,529
regard to draws data protection by

142
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,839
design and data protection by default

143
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
you have to implement the data

144
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,730
protection for it is from start when you

145
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,910
start writing code for drones you have

146
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,770
to think about it you have to think

147
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,990
about that a protection by design you

148
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,520
have to embed I will put I'm in the next

149
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,459
slide you have to embed the data

150
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,850
protection principle in the code because

151
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,220
it cannot be an afterthought you cannot

152
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,970
you cannot like write codes free and

153
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,850
open source code for the use of drones

154
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,910
even if it's an autopilot without having

155
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,910
privacy in mind you cannot patch it

156
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,070
later you have to think it when you

157
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,290
start developing because you have to

158
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,200
abide to data possession by design and

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
data possession by default by default

160
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,370
this means that the system have to

161
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,310
minimize the data they gather it's

162
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,560
missing strange because drones do

163
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,270
normally the opposite they are a

164
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,910
fantastic platform for gathering data

165
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,230
which is all perfectly fine unless they

166
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,020
if there are no personal data but if

167
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,570
there are personal data you have to

168
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,360
comply with the principle it has been

169
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,940
said before we love compliance we may we

170
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,600
we have to be we have to be compliant

171
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,480
with privacy and then of course it is

172
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,329
the privacy impact assessment you are of

173
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:38,770
course it may be they that the data

174
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,220
control

175
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,370
[Music]

176
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,079
[Music]

177
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,240
the european union we don't know but

178
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,170
anyways it will be a binding rule all of

179
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,370
the you so effectively creating common

180
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,950
market for drones so it's very important

181
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,770
and it's kind of different we especially

182
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,260
with with regard to the rules which are

183
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,010
already

184
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,190
in Italy we've been the first among the

185
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,340
first one to regulate to regulate drones

186
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,710
maybe in the wrong way but we were among

187
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,450
among the first one what water I won't

188
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,070
go with the rules but I want just to

189
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,890
state some points because they may be of

190
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,860
interest of course for people who will

191
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,850
develop the software which allows to run

192
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,270
those drones one of the most important

193
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,690
category is the open category zero which

194
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,300
is almost completely free small drones

195
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,570
which are deemed to be of negligible

196
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,600
risk they have some limits I won't go

197
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
into all the limits you can read it but

198
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,700
they are they don't need with pilot

199
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,230
license they don't need pilot

200
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,020
registration they have of course some

201
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,330
limits they are they have to be marked

202
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,960
as toys they they have to be compliant

203
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,840
with a regulator with a regulation to

204
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,230
note the directive sorry 48 2009 and you

205
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,840
have to bear the see mark but apart from

206
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,780
that they are substantially free they

207
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:11,349
the open category one has as a different

208
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,829
as a bit bigger injuries level but still

209
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,609
this injury level means they are certain

210
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,150
they don't make any risk of severe

211
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,640
personal injuries to people or to

212
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,770
colleague with regard to collision with

213
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,130
planes and in this case still there is

214
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,610
no pilot license it is kind of different

215
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,940
as it is now so many you can fly many

216
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,860
drones without pilot's license up

217
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,430
provided the operators are registered

218
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,570
the two bigger cathegories have another

219
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,870
have another requirement which is very

220
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,700
interesting and of course it has to be

221
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,530
implemented via via software they have

222
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,180
geofencing an electronic identification

223
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,540
so you have to implement geofencing it's

224
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,150
very simple but of course it has to be

225
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,640
effective and so you have to think about

226
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,670
it

227
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,640
from the start for the two main open

228
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,980
category two and open category open

229
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,880
category three of of drones so the new

230
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,630
regulation will hopefully open up the

231
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,500
markets but there are several amis there

232
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,870
are no autonomous drones or it doesn't

233
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,850
seem there are autonomous drones the

234
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,760
limit of hates and distance loss means

235
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,180
visual an aside to now you can follow

236
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,060
your drones regardless of where you are

237
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,790
but the regulation we still have the

238
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,070
limit of the visual line of sight so

239
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,240
they may be they may be some problems

240
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,230
what about building your own drone

241
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,180
subcategory zero which is the first one

242
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,480
very small one very small ones can be

243
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,940
privately built but they have to comply

244
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,990
the sea to comply with a regulation and

245
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,140
in every other category the the

246
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,050
performer the operation can be performed

247
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,140
with the UAS so with a drone that's what

248
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,330
is simply which is placed in the market

249
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,330
there is not has not been modified in a

250
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,040
way that breaches compliance with the

251
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,510
product requirements so this is of

252
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,540
course we as we said twice we like

253
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,670
compliance but you have to bear in mind

254
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,460
this that of course it's not a problem

255
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,980
if there is no problem of writing an

256
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,320
open-source sea free and open-source

257
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,080
system which is for instance an auto

258
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,020
pilot for drones we have a key note of

259
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,880
using free and open source software on

260
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,060
on air traffic control which is of

261
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,300
course even a bigger degree of security

262
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,320
issues so I'm positive we can write good

263
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,120
and so certifiable code also for for

264
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,480
drones one key point and I don't know if

265
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,460
they're going to change is that the

266
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,290
regulation should apply to model

267
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,050
aircraft as well not only to commercial

268
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,610
drones but also to model aircraft

269
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,370
so even if we are developing something

270
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,529
which we is going to be applied for

271
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,809
model aircraft we have to take into

272
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,539
consideration this future regulation

273
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,059
still the very the very next future

274
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,940
in conclusion we really need to fully

275
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,760
apply data protection rules and also

276
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,100
security rules to drone that's the

277
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,370
reason why with the University of

278
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,769
Cagliari and some other universities we

279
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,080
are thinking to apply to the kozma

280
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,769
program which is which is a program

281
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,889
which has the aim to raise awareness for

282
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,860
civil drones operators and privacy on

283
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,039
data protection obligations this is very

284
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,870
important if you want to try and and

285
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,909
participate to that to this standard

286
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:14,789
with us just drop me a note and I think

287
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,669
that indeed it is very important to

288
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,250
raise awareness and we can also raise

289
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,710
awareness on how much free and

290
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,260
open-source software can contribute in

291
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,350
the transparency of the process of using

292
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,190
drones and also in the in raising the

293
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,669
security of abusing drones so this could

294
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,419
be a good opportunity and the deadline I

295
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,149
think is the the first days of April so

296
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:45,450
we have still time to to organize if we

297
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,250
don't if we don't abide then okay we can

298
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,299
have some some not nice outcome I don't

299
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,000
know if you have seen this video of a

300
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,769
chimp oh who wants to defend his privacy

301
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,620
against against a drone but even even

302
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,429
human have to defend themselves

303
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:10,980
or on the other hand we may it may

304
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,309
happen like that a widespread ban in

305
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,370
many areas because there is no

306
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,350
compliance with privacy and security

307
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,130
rules and this is not of course the

308
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,340
outcome where we're searching for so we

309
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,000
have really to evaluate our freedom we

310
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,820
can implement for sure these rules with

311
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,050
the free and open source

312
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,410
software and we have to do it so thank

313
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,990
you very much for for for your patience

314
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,390
thank you very much for healing with

315
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,700
different microphones and I'm open to

316
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:53,150
questions if I have time I don't know

317
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,670
okay okay

318
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:06,360
questions yes what are the penalties if

319
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,640
you don't follow the requirements that

320
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,440
you mentioned from the EU okay there are

321
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,010
in the regulations it is just stated

322
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,670
that the penalties have to be are they

323
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,250
quite proportionate and dissuasive it

324
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,700
will be to the Member States to decide

325
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,180
which are the penalties I can tell you

326
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,640
about Italy but it's a widespread

327
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,820
problem because normally when you use a

328
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,140
few flake immersive drone rules for

329
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,440
airplanes apply penalties tend to be

330
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,290
awfully hefty for instance under Italian

331
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,140
law if you fly a drone without insurance

332
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,920
or even without holding without a pilot

333
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,740
and operator holding the certificate for

334
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
not holding the certificate you may risk

335
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,130
a fine of 30000 euros for not having

336
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,520
your drone insured 100,000 euros which

337
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,970
is negligible if you are if you're an

338
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,370
aircraft carrier if you're drawing a

339
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,710
commercial drone pilot well it's not

340
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:20,720
negligible so it will depend yes

341
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,650
so one of your slides said that drones

342
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,640
can be modified but make sure that it

343
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,610
has not changed the compliance the

344
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,310
regulation or it was yes like right so

345
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,650
the idea is that after each modification

346
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:59,760
it has to be recertified well if you if

347
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,850
you go through the if you go through the

348
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:10,050
regulation it says that the the producer

349
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:16,680
the producer has to has to assess that

350
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,920
also in case of software updates it will

351
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,060
still bill it will still be compliant of

352
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,560
course

353
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,630
changing in the way we think when we

354
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,820
think about to free software is very

355
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,790
different but it's a problem that that

356
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,510
arises in every kind of environment

357
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,070
where you have to use certify the

358
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,600
products as I said there will be a talk

359
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,610
on so if if they can use it for air

360
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,640
traffic control I'm positive they can

361
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,150
use it also for drones or you can use of

362
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,010
course it's a problem of making people

363
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,690
understand that of course you can have

364
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,940
your freedom and of course if it's if

365
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,220
it's a if it's for instance release

366
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,750
under GPL v3 you know you cannot stop it

367
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,650
from modifying it but you can you have

368
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,570
to maybe by by assigning the first code

369
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,990
you have to just make persons understand

370
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,300
that you sell the project and if you

371
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,030
change it you are allowed to change it

372
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,740
but you may lose acidification

373
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:38,699
it's there an legal agreement between EU

374
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,159
countries and non-eu countries for

375
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,139
example EU countries and Switzerland is

376
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:46,799
there any kind of agreement no but I

377
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
talked to about drugs in Switzerland in

378
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,320
September these rules are quite similar

379
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,699
to today to the EU ones they are not

380
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,579
much difference and this regulation has

381
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,559
some similarities also with other

382
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,679
regulations like the FAA regulation in

383
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,779
the States but there is no international

384
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,539
agreement that's all time we have for

385
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,070
questions thank you very much

386
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,230
