1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:18,020
ok to talk about what the topic on the virtual file system kino.to user

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,520
 academic tag got your experience report will be like creditworthiness and will be like that

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:38,430
 water also experience for cats before 25 motivation at goes like this topic was

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,530
 how would look at the virtual file system how does it cost netzer

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,649
 [Music]

6
00:00:50,570 --> 00:01:05,399
 so the system provides the yard and the party is on the toom

7
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:12,479
 disappointing if you have the economic engine the duck of

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:22,679
 outlook and overall looked matthias horn so arose before almost knowledge despite the

9
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:30,630
 tumors implement operating system that with make sense is only on machu picchu

10
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,079
 and applications starts we now want to add applications from the user

11
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:50,428
 system performance linux tools and interactive the system as good as it came

12
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:59,159
 that is stated we have the application on top of the operating system element

13
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,499
 to use open source application suite in just look at twick it in some places and

14
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:13,220
 portland whether discharging at the keynote systems as well as more detailed

15
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:20,780
 look into composers and the security oriented composition is often on that

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,680
 applications and core performance sensitive ports out of complex big applications

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:39,680
 the chip card security properties the big bad is to lure the wm feeling

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,209
 willi complex components so complex component many people are using is that

19
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,400
 differently, more small things become really complex surfing in source code now so using

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,010
 the how complex libraries and wants to look at the source code decide the

21
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:16,880
 composites so station rossis traditional applications that don't get willi

22
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:28,640
 porter.com post in smaller companies this will be between the professional so

23
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:40,480
 exactly i have the system different from

24
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,920
 jo wat ass är expressions of application outsourcing and what will happen to uk ireland

25
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:59,390
 as well as would have been located at one first pick property of the system that is

26
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,970
 unemployed he is the purpose ation had bestowed global human resources on that

27
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:12,980
 system is expected globally the tree of directors and who is the resource of the

28
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,699
 system knows how to access and very different in nature

29
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:25,310
 now this also has data storage vienna of pictures or e-mails or

30
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:35,419
 confirmation data is a few cents together ex-bayer files and even the

31
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:53,330
 graphic user interface is based on fire based access now resources snow of the

32
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:09,440
 word meanwhile access control to try to be viewed as expected

33
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:19,669
 nike is the single fire with fire wings and the cinematic as well

34
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:30,969
 applications need for speed the run time is basically doing locations in practice

35
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:45,070
 we also have something like the positive one is willy use it can easily

36
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,440
 Those interested in the mobile phone applicationserver using the taste of the

37
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:58,490
 marche i had to identify what was used by the applications from the system area so the

38
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:14,860
 reporter put the pot on the shots from a single source is michael bay

39
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:23,799
 system should michael be able to do private any abstraction slot as well

40
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:35,440
 system integration system is trained ebase with mosley global namespace

41
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,270
 applications the deep end on global view and resources interviews with don't have

42
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:50,180
 set in the film sister like don't want to know system like food on the on the

43
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,520
 security concepts take two interactive

44
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,920
 a grand access control objectives now know how to telegate to components

45
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:22,300
 an advertising character either toni hellfire stormy system extremists

46
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,440
 you know you want to keep up the logical on components and components

47
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:52,050
 should not be to complex software application services that can be ended

48
00:07:52,050 --> 00:08:03,160
 up sekuhrity properties and the jobs are expected to tow these components

49
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,130
 in the energy system knows how compliance has use case offers so rauter

50
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,620
 implementation very different system structure den pc leykam using the talk

51
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,980
 They want to go to the system integrator Cannon Briggs's provider system

52
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,690
 the system square remco gerritsen is without the word

53
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:37,720
 never required news case a die and service the system software complexity

54
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,570
 des interview back center security horse indoors system and so i think it's

55
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,540
 important to there are software complexes the first bank

56
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:11,990
 because comparing so system system sounds like the world to just textbox course

57
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,780
 cranes no dos and that could be no that is already published parallel system

58
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:30,530
 part of the car fans like how researches the reports on customizing and application

59
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:50,780
 on top of the story completely cost mostly sensation like sony moments

60
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,089
 runtime environment and one element is economic performance

61
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:13,180
 application can access resources like that used to the application system

62
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:26,120
 the cover-up of doping the simple system implementation buddhism connect

63
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,519
 be.connected the time-out wanted keynote systems and have to find a way

64
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:45,910
 to connect the [ __ ] back end to end last point like status like implement

65
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:58,480
 back and forth autopsy functions of the first application support so the

66
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
 cans of 2000 francs

67
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:11,480
 because like added some small tweaks txtr.com july to the adware confession

68
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,410
 expect it applications so is now the innovative state and may practitioner

69
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:32,870
 starting this stage is like briefly extent that you louis both people connection

70
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:40,550
 to the keynote services to take that like interviews no plugins talk show

71
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,069
 industry so the Ticino could be extended and the state are shared

72
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,949
 libraries implement implement plugins

73
00:11:52,209 --> 00:12:00,369
 operates the libri zu gino services has soloist here on the first lack ins wie

74
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:08,990
 implemented and imports together are from the implementation in tholey

75
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,329
 borisov kinos links and application connector blog access to the block

76
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,579
 service on the system like the application kurz-news exclusive edition

77
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:26,959
 of the art, like support network stacks, is the motto ip stack

78
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:34,670
 even so on selinux ip stack and top of cinemas the posco location prevail

79
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,790
 library and connected just watch the network interface

80
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:53,120
 who also offers experiments with traffic, answers here so andy lees

81
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,670
 plugin interface head of march in this case as well as coaches link to gary moore

82
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:13,550
 complicated starting stack interface and connect to the fix drivers and tobacco

83
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:32,660
 cinemas so half an application would now have whether the 'taz' still change to

84
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,819
 the not because it's and using the report on the y

85
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:48,760
 because like plaque rottenbauer plugins in this case for access celebrated hottest

86
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,730
 appalled components of the application is running in denver i have micro core

87
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,460
 protection to blogs service net connect application to do blog which shows friction

88
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,940
 in this case

89
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:15,370
 now possible to implement in karbon and daughter maike kern relies on sony

90
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,560
 manager Hervé this case as the neat got plug in for the same application

91
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,670
 who has connect or blogs service patrick weiser from the service which in

92
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:38,170
 turn danuser block device to was so horrified the pick 200 shed the the

93
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:45,910
 integrated on the system can choose how to storage system application should

94
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:55,420
 be connected services and topic the components should be so then

95
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:04,810
 how we run together first applications and also have cinemas live servers

96
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,319
 to test network implementation songs

97
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,690
 engine components spot will neither be missing nor would the appearances really

98
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:30,550
 environment and unix tools and stuff so new development so luxor takes part

99
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,550
 from unix software now in love with cars there the simple command line

100
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,160
 oriented tools and whether the users too

101
00:15:43,350 --> 00:16:08,280
 Often the compost of the sport offers implement by putting the course on very

102
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:17,529
 hard to properties and to defend the porch as implemented

103
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:27,819
 there are started time components photos applications which says short is built

104
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:38,279
 the tvi potatoes in the sourcecode agrar reform conficker because the enormous

105
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:48,790
 configuration tools and build system and just link to the 27 states and top to the

106
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,719
 unix runtime environment of the

107
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:11,579
 different application system for connected services like have bunch of

108
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,270
 application scanning and grandpa of shares of the cius im joking resource

109
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:28,870
 representation it is and whether the complication of the

110
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:36,389
 single gypsy just like don't use the plug in the commitment to plaques web

111
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:45,399
 2.0 services lag log file system on network connect this component linux

112
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:53,860
 runtime proportions of the picture it component of the session runs on the

113
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:01,260
 The same luxo share as the network starts via Fürst components is michelle

114
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:12,399
 bachelet the program running dogs and dad get to know the tract

115
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:24,389
 linux runtime was the session and access to spawn is channels

116
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:34,810
 so what's new in yoox is how did not implement the vfs of wax it in the ad

117
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:43,210
 hoc weltformel eisler vfs implementation first wfs implementation as well as would have

118
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:55,230
 louis implements framework for directed to where we could plugin

119
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:04,260
 features like just mount and afs therefore tui on the system

120
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,408
 OK

121
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,110
 Yes

122
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,299
 so after the experience throws lux one time

123
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:37,450
 and the feeling of the apps is very big step forward resort okay half that

124
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:44,619
 we fixed framework would be plugins inside the lynx one time has klopp my name

125
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:56,340
 is going on the composer was the 800 profit from the vfc implementation and would have had to muff

126
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:05,139
 so implementation into the gypsy & dance he does this from quick lows

127
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:15,119
 operate eject components as well as dualie replace the special lipsi plugins

128
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:30,580
 like flash plugins like don't have to go bases to come back from die resource

129
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:38,220
 representation before the high lusen time to pay process representation instance

130
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:52,239
 develop individual configuration interactive the system export could

131
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:58,659
 shot the bfs is conficker in gene autry

132
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:05,590
 using extra to configure components that are very easy to the very low complexity

133
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:12,488
 pause before now components use the same configuration madison interested and

134
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:17,669
 had just before that something like that never too far ahead so conficker the bfs at

135
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:28,289
 excel here almost completely on the component configuration

136
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
 50

137
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:52,570
 so nice directory not ev fst or plug-ins also just inside the

138
00:21:52,570 --> 00:22:01,810
 directory notes today top level and life with the direct reload from so the die

139
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:14,040
 victim plugins came have to say goodbye firmly company the the plugin

140
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,980
 activated initial configuration what the uci and truck stops configuration

141
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:29,850
 emergencies lipsi der tabs lipsi mechanisms of function 2 the lecturer of the case die

142
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:40,719
 standard error log as stuck plugin and is completely in

143
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,010
 bonn so develop here is with the precise

144
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:52,629
 declaration on resource representation in which we it so when the buddy cannon

145
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:59,200
 look at in the configuration ncs resources to do list components in the

146
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,350
 system

147
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:13,930
 this takes effect before the plug-in is changed by plugins and the implemented

148
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,200
 just as implement chores ab it was finally said

149
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:35,080
 the implemented feature in the pfs dies dies notes organized system at

150
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:47,110
 one level so is prove the hottest here in the systems note from the first

151
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:59,250
 one you can live in the june walk in the second was the guest

152
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,480
 configuration in the configuration

153
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:14,790
 des ting tings you can just lipsi leibowitz ears configuration as well

154
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:24,270
 bahnchef bunch of plugins implementation the first one view is is a mapping tool

155
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:33,850
 as michael körner system as the head line for means to use with what you is

156
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:41,189
 in the system develop the hottest 12

157
00:24:49,950 --> 00:25:03,900
 on the current model system is mike is giving it here in an extra

158
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:12,669
 attribute so much also so aesthetic emergency system

159
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:21,879
 But then the service book implementation had to be looked up

160
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:26,379
 debugging there from immediately active configuration is included in in

161
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:40,449
 self-defense it possible to just create vfs of the fixed content as well as video for

 song mobile phones in front of positive locations easy classic of the final zero devices

163
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:52,629
 in addition as well as have there are pretty implementation as well as know hands bfs

 the prince important to be implemented water loki instance of night of the

 proms systems applications contemporary files and store data offered that too

166
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:36,220
 note because service report celebrated private cinema like outside of people

 services directly on fire as well as canon label the publication is to

168
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:54,570
 get that used to - from baby hours to gate taut access block device directive

169
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:13,080
 body as it was implemented in early development as well as extension feature

170
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,929
 on which we are now possible to do not bfs the knot and the co

171
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,730
 implementation in the displays the implementation trust open instead of object

 festival the darling of one time to application and used as custom beer festival

173
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:41,040
 plugins of the equity fund example is random generator implementation based on

174
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:50,580
 twitter entropy on the you can be used in applications networks nat network

175
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,820
 applications of view citywire implementation is the second example

176
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,179
 and a base password generator

177
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:23,440
 from imports, do to connect existence services to application is so sexy based

178
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,940
 applications can also add a few tables to the system and

179
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:37,679
 access excel such a first defense blood is whether it is so here on the mound

180
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:48,750
 that the hottest monte of the ewz team is here, too, so is the label

181
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:57,070
 ok it still says config protection back to the resources late late

182
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:05,350
 Confectionery good and lock configuration on plug-ins in zoos notes in case of

183
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:15,490
 the file system confess according to diesel car right to file system like

184
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:23,980
 just as very ok if the rest of the session is requests for service saas truth

185
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,970
 configuration attribute it about unfamiliar users from the directory on the

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:34,630
 tomorrow on the forester and imports to if necessary here is this configuration

187
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:39,600
 nicos loosely also worries about the application of the to some and angie need

188
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:48,459
 and services is conficker so use policies is the top value in the

189
00:29:48,460 --> 00:30:00,630
 configuration not on the services look including family one knows the configuration

190
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:10,799
 on which we it here the lizard properties and sausage like this

191
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:19,950
 machine that uses the hottest is able to continue too far or does it say there

192
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,620
 would also have the visibility can be

193
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:29,870
 limited and information

194
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:39,280
 red august the whole at the university of vienna

195
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:49,780
 missing the change talk about we were to blitz in metal components vidon from

196
00:30:49,780 --> 00:31:19,960
 central namespace was okay wolf is the supply there lived global namespace

197
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,960
 how wants to use the server is too can be like how new teams start

198
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:37,020
 in the system 22 this will be tomorrow

199
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:46,410
 computing the same we supply so

200
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:01,379
 yes to the nation

201
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:21,970
 the pens could and the system configuration so the engine ots

 as an intimate complex application position closing of the virtual box continues

209
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:27,940
 increase in the crash the very special case yes how often applications running on top
