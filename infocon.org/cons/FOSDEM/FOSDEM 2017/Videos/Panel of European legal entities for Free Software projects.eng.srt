1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,078
okay well

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,730
we're going to get started could

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,080
somebody in the back please close that

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,180
door please so we have more quiet thank

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,160
you I am working to get my one slide up

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,250
so that I can have the names of the

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,300
panelists in front of you here today

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,289
we're going to have a a panel on

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,580
European legal entities for free

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,550
software projects a lot has been

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,070
happening in this space and particularly

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,920
in this past year and so what we'd like

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,660
to do is give you an opportunity to meet

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,600
some new organizations and hear from

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,110
them what I propose we do is give each

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,449
panelist of just a five minute

17
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:48,760
introduction or a brief introduction to

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,680
their organization I'll ask one or two

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,949
questions and then we'll open it up to

20
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,690
the audience for questions

21
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,680
oh well finally I have my my slide with

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,500
the names on it in fact is this the one

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:12,520
that okay well let's that way you can at

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,299
least see thanks first of all slamming

25
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:24,130
tips hello good afternoon and welcome

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,159
from all of us I'm up first because I

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,409
managed to get to the starting line

28
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,950
first out of the the three of at this

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,270
end of the panel here over the last few

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,890
years it's become increasingly obvious

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,909
that it's important to have

32
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,790
organizations who will look after the

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,729
administrative and legal duties of

34
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,079
growing communities of free and

35
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,540
open-source software and so we've seen a

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,939
growth of demand from organizations that

37
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,100
do this organizations like the software

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,810
freedom Conservancy organizations like

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,530
Apache Fit Software Foundation and there

40
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,710
seems to be an infinite amount of demand

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,730
and I realized about two years ago that

42
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,830
all of the organizations that did

43
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,280
general

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,090
purpose fiduciary hosting were based in

45
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,230
America and as somebody who's also

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,470
involved in digital civil liberties that

47
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,650
alarmed me because I felt that I don't

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,810
necessarily want all of the assets of

49
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,300
projects I'm working on to be under US

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,760
law because you never know what might

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,120
happen in the United States thank you

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,030
[Laughter]

53
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,830
I'm coming on to that so I started

54
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,510
throwing the idea around talking about

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,360
there being a year European fiduciary

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,280
host now by fiduciary fiduciary is an

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,530
English word that means to do with good

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,769
faith and so fiduciary hosting means

59
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,050
looking after all the things that are

60
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,160
done in good faith to meet legal and

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,150
good governance requirements and so I

62
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,709
started thinking about how one would

63
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,350
create a fiduciary host in the UK I did

64
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,880
some research I found out in the UK

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,590
about a thing called a Community

66
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,209
Interest Company which is a

67
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,519
not-for-profit but not charity

68
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
organization and I decided I would start

69
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,579
a fiduciary umbrella in the UK to serve

70
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,120
Europe at the same time as I was doing

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,660
this moritz was doing the same thing and

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,040
Michiel was doing the same thing and we

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,150
hadn't bought that we all know each

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,709
other we'd forgotten to mention it to

75
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,220
each other and so we've all three gone

76
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
ahead and created organizations they are

77
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,630
they are quite different from each other

78
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,920
in character so public software is a

79
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,410
term that I didn't actually coin it I've

80
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,239
not found out who coined the term public

81
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,940
software public software is a term to

82
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,760
avoid the need to decide whether you're

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,290
going to say open source or free

84
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,850
software and it means software that has

85
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,680
got the software freedom included inside

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,409
it and so software freedom is the the

87
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,010
baseline of what public software does we

88
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,780
are a community interest company that

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,169
means

90
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,199
we are able to engage in trading and

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,749
commercial activity but we are not

92
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,759
allowed to use the proceeds of that

93
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,770
commercial activity for anything other

94
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,689
than the service of the public community

95
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,849
we've declared we will serve and the

96
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,499
public community we've declared we will

97
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,710
serve is those people who are the users

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,039
and creators of public software and so

99
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,490
we we have the same constraints on us as

100
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,879
would be on a charity but we don't have

101
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,289
the ability to recover tax benefits and

102
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,909
that's probably the largest difference

103
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:11,229
between us and everybody else I don't

104
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,539
really believe that matters because I've

105
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,460
tried making donations across Europe to

106
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,729
other organizations and the cost of

107
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,279
recovering the tax getting the tax

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,400
benefit is has always been larger than

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
the tax benefit because the process that

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,069
you have to engage in is always a heavy

111
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,319
bureaucratic process so while in Europe

112
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,819
we do have an environment where

113
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,169
theoretically you can make

114
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,229
tax-deductible donations across borders

115
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,229
in reality for most country pairs that

116
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,349
is not practical and because of that I

117
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,399
believe that the the recovery of tax

118
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,490
benefit is a very marginal benefit for

119
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,439
an organization providing fiduciary

120
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,080
hosting in Europe now when larger sums

121
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,939
of money are involved such as the ones

122
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,399
that that Moritz is working with I think

123
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,499
there is a case to be made about getting

124
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,810
tax-deductible donations so public

125
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,860
software started in February last year

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,689
we have one project working with us now

127
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:13,120
a project called travel spirit travel

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,939
spirit is a community of quite diverse

129
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,939
community of individuals and companies

130
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,949
working on mobility as a service

131
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,430
software that's the idea of creating

132
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,029
open source frameworks for running

133
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,469
things like uber at a city level

134
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,550
probably through a public transit

135
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,020
authority rather than through a

136
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,379
predatory private corporation and so

137
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,240
that project is going fairly well that's

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,759
been going for nearly a year now and is

139
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,490
doing doing ok so public software now

140
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,090
we're based in the

141
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,940
okay.i I hadn't anticipated there will

142
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,830
be any problem with being based in the

143
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,949
UK a European organisation and and then

144
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,690
you know you know how bad things can

145
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,830
happen to countries sometimes well

146
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,979
unfortunately we have very very

147
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,020
gentlemanly and refined fascists in the

148
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,150
UK and they've they've managed to

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,330
persuade the country to vote to to be

150
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,699
unfriendly to the rest of Europe and so

151
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,800
that complicates public software and our

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,930
queue of people wanting to join has

153
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,160
become much much much reduced we've

154
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,919
discovered oh that's all very much to

155
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,010
the advantage of the gentleman over to

156
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,139
my right who was next I think you were

157
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,680
next when you Lawrence Oh Mickey I was

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:41,620
the next so oh so am i audible so I come

159
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,590
from assignment as is a well-known open

160
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:51,880
source VIP I come from from a far lesser

161
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,010
known region I work for a small charity

162
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,830
called an illness foundation we twenty

163
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,660
years ago in actually thirty years ago

164
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,180
an illness sort of came into life by a

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,789
group of Unix engineers that announced

166
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,860
the EU net and an L net was a Dutch part

167
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,680
of that it grew grew grew ten years

168
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,930
later seven years later that became a

169
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,570
separate foundation it was a sort of a

170
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,150
network for that a grassroots network

171
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,130
across Europe that grew into a basically

172
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,770
European Internet in 1997 everything was

173
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,630
sold and all the money went into a trust

174
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,639
fund and that's where it that's what the

175
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,960
story starts because we started giving

176
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,880
out money to all these projects hundreds

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,740
of projects that are doing all kinds of

178
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,070
cool open source stuff and over the

179
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,669
years we just watched people suffer and

180
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,410
suffer and we met many people that

181
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,600
wanted to do stuff about it we saw I

182
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,640
mean we worked with with many people in

183
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,410
the field and as time grew we wanted to

184
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,209
find a solution to the problem that when

185
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,160
you get a bunch of really good engineers

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,200
and

187
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,620
they create something cool and then they

188
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,180
become so successful that you send them

189
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,940
to lawyers and that is just a very

190
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,710
painful thing for them to live through

191
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,330
and then yeah give them money and they

192
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,420
have to to get a community to build the

193
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,950
community by the way it's interesting is

194
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,170
that we're programmed against the

195
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,750
community track I I think I feel more at

196
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,310
home in the community track than in the

197
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,770
legal track because I'm not a lawyer but

198
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,350
I this is for us is this how do we build

199
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,630
communities and so the idea was let's

200
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,030
take the whole burden out of the whole

201
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,680
pressure out of getting organized

202
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,710
because we are as an element we are a

203
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,530
charity we can receive money we can pay

204
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,840
money there's a huge tax benefit to

205
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
being paid by a charity at least in some

206
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,770
countries there's no income tax on that

207
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,520
so you get a pretty nice in some cases

208
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,190
half of your wages suddenly become

209
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,710
tax-free that is a pretty attractive

210
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,800
benefit but as a charity we're a

211
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,560
professional manager of funds people can

212
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,030
give us money and we can professionally

213
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,640
manage those there's oversight and we've

214
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,860
seen so many small foundations where a

215
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,680
couple of willing people are able to do

216
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,210
this sustained this for a couple of

217
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,700
years but the 75 years of copyright

218
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,470
after the death of the last remaining

219
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,650
code author is nowhere near to be seen

220
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,110
in any of the foundations that we see so

221
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,580
we thought why don't we create a vehicle

222
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,010
to end all vehicles so we named our

223
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,380
project this is a funny name as a

224
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,530
hypervisor for free software foundations

225
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,980
so what we what we do is we we give

226
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,650
people sort of their own environment but

227
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,410
instead of putting the money into that

228
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,140
environment we ask people to just just

229
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,550
like a squirrel put out the nuts

230
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,920
everywhere they can for instance at an

231
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,500
illness foundation or any other place

232
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,180
and all that we do were illegal Dropbox

233
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,000
in a way people can put their code under

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
copyrights and their assets in a safe

235
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,360
place knowing that it is community

236
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,980
governed and that it will always be that

237
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,680
way so it's a there's a zero

238
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,819
[Music]

239
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,619
we don't we cannot make profits because

240
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,149
we actually promised to not have a

241
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,699
single euro ever in our foundation so we

242
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,879
are completely separate ethereal only

243
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,029
intangible assets and our dream is to

244
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,679
completely automate things so that

245
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,069
people can just put stay safe stuff in

246
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,069
inside our foundation have programs that

247
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:29,719
manage these so the the virtual

248
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,489
organizations can exist and there's a

249
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,449
mechanism for people to decide on on

250
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,579
creating yet another license on top of

251
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:42,139
their code or changing names or for king

252
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:45,109
or whatever but there's no reason for

253
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:48,379
them to to go to and spend a lot of

254
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,159
money dude do three monthly tax payments

255
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,289
even though there's no money inside you

256
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,849
still have to file these things so

257
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,999
basically our idea is to simplify and

258
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,419
automate that and we've we've gone for a

259
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,679
very promiscuous model but we don't

260
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,059
impose stuff because anybody it's just

261
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,219
like getting children anybody can get a

262
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,449
child than anybody can start a

263
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,069
foundation they can buddy well do what

264
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,419
they want so we're not gonna sit on

265
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,879
anybody's chair and make them do

266
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,919
anything we will just hand them best

267
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,359
practices what we feel are best

268
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,220
practices and they can sort of ask us

269
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,159
for rational sane templates of doing

270
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,549
things and those are then just like

271
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,199
virtual machines you can create virtual

272
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,499
organisations any way any shape flavor

273
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,919
model that you want yeah I think that's

274
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,959
enough for now and we'll get to the real

275
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,738
news maybe later

276
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,419
hello I'm Moritz I was active in the

277
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,309
kind of free software space mostly in

278
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,089
the Internet

279
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,709
what's the so-called Internet freedom

280
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,059
space and in 2013 I joined a foundation

281
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,439
called the Renewable Freedom Foundation

282
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,319
it's a charity in Germany and the

283
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,579
mission of the Renewable Freedom

284
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,739
Foundation is just to strengthen and

285
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:12,829
defend civil liberties in the digital

286
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:17,809
space so I began in 2013 together with

287
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,270
people at the foundation to

288
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,980
come up with a concept of what the

289
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,510
foundation would actually be doing it

290
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,090
was set up in 2012 by a Bavarian

291
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,850
newspaper publisher so he set aside some

292
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,490
of the money that he's been making we

293
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,890
are not officially affiliated with the

294
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,200
newspaper we are sort of affiliated with

295
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,350
the founder the current publisher the

296
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,470
publisher of that newspaper and in 2014

297
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,840
I took the guy who was back then running

298
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,830
the foundation to roughly 40 events to

299
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,560
introduce him to many projects different

300
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,290
communities in in the space of

301
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,790
opendata New Journalism kind of

302
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,560
whistleblowing

303
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,170
and of course the whole space of

304
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,230
technology that I was familiar with and

305
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,320
over time we the foundation is it was

306
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,530
meant to give out funds so quite similar

307
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,000
to a Nelnet but on a smaller scale and

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,580
we kind of positioned ourselves as an

309
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,710
intermediary so what I noticed very

310
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,890
quickly that there's a lot of funding

311
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,510
potentially flooding into the Internet

312
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,760
freedom space and that it can be quite

313
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,530
damaging if you don't if you don't

314
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,720
handle it the right way if you're naive

315
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,240
and you take that money you're going to

316
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,860
end up with a broken project and the

317
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,030
broken community so my my stance always

318
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,420
was that we have to address this we a

319
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,490
lot of people and a lot of projects that

320
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,610
I talked to they want money they want to

321
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,040
grow and think that money can be an a

322
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,890
enabler for that I am very skeptical

323
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,560
about about money in the space of these

324
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,720
these very enthusiasm driven efforts in

325
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,530
in the human rights space but of course

326
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,710
I it there's a valid point in saying

327
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,420
that you have to have something to eat

328
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,880
you have to have have some kind of

329
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,400
stability in your life that you can you

330
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,040
can continue doing what you what you

331
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,930
want to do so in being a funder you can

332
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,480
interact with other foundations that do

333
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,330
grants and I help people write their

334
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,769
grant applications

335
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,129
I was able to kind of explore the space

336
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,249
of potential funders that fund whether

337
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,499
human rights angle so I participate in a

338
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:47,869
lot of human rights conferences where

339
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,649
the digital does not play a big role not

340
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,110
as big as it will become in that space

341
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,639
because of all the stuff that is

342
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,019
happening there with targeted malware

343
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,329
attacks against activists journalists

344
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,399
surveillance and and all these these

345
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,699
topics and I build bridges between a lot

346
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,689
of different communities and so most of

347
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,459
what I do is just listen to whether

348
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,319
people are what their problems are and

349
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,139
and to see who I can point them to or

350
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,019
how I can help them with their current

351
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,239
efforts and at the same time since we've

352
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:27,189
been handing out a bit of money it's I

353
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,879
that the problem is for that for that

354
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,100
problem when you when you have money as

355
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,290
how to how to make sure the team

356
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,240
understands how they will do things

357
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,309
sometimes it's very organically that the

358
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,259
founder of a project would start a

359
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,420
foundation or some legal entity or he

360
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,059
already has a for-profit that that he

361
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,769
starts using and there's never the point

362
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,529
where you make very conscious decisions

363
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,889
about who is in control of the assets of

364
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,779
the projects and who is in control of

365
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,290
like the financial assets and I think

366
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,499
the the major benefit that I see for for

367
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:06,470
a for a fiduciary sponsor is that the

368
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,779
the moment you you join a fiduciary

369
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,970
sponsor there's certain things where you

370
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,329
we should make clear agreements and this

371
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,970
is the point of realization within the

372
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,549
community of around the project of what

373
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:21,730
their needs are and how to protect those

374
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,659
those needs and the communities and that

375
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,659
led me to I can host some things at the

376
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,340
foundation but it's not that

377
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,889
straightforward so we have been hosting

378
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,809
a couple of bank accounts for some

379
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,929
projects to hold some of the funding and

380
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,860
in March we started creating like

381
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,260
developing this the Center for the

382
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,360
cultivation of Technology

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,850
we registered in October so it's a

384
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,630
really recent development we we are now

385
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,799
organizationally ready in the kind of in

386
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,149
the legal sense to be active our legal

387
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,070
form is we are based in Germany with the

388
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,990
company the company is fully owned by

389
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,240
the foundation which is a charity but

390
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
the company itself is also a charity but

391
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
it's a it's it's a limited liability

392
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,270
company it's a gmbh in germany with the

393
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,309
charity status so it's a combined with

394
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,000
sig again bihar it can do for-profit

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,450
activities so when projects want to

396
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,789
engage in minor for-profit activities

397
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,799
that's possible and I'm mostly focusing

398
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,640
on on projects in a stage where the they

399
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,159
they they've been successful they they

400
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,710
are around they have they have a sort of

401
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,630
community maybe of the community of one

402
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,919
developer that is fairly common and they

403
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,169
need a legal entity for some specific

404
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,919
thing like a grant that is being offered

405
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,130
or people coming they want to donate

406
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,200
they want to contribute 10 euros the

407
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,240
project is not going to actually benefit

408
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,370
from the 10 euros that much but if

409
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,510
there's some bank account somewhere

410
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,850
where there's little complexity they can

411
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,159
fill it up and use it for hackathons or

412
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,070
for a bit of travel so a very light

413
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,740
involvement and on the other hand all

414
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,880
the projects in the Internet freedom

415
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,850
space where there is this NGO ization

416
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,820
there is this movement to getting

417
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
funding and actually the first project

418
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,390
that I I didn't even like ahead on on a

419
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,799
mental map we're now the first project

420
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,350
that we're taking on is a European

421
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,890
Commission funded consortium and we are

422
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,690
one of the partner organizations in that

423
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,580
consortium and I think that's a very

424
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,970
good example because they they expect to

425
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,909
be a limited liability company they want

426
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,000
usually consortium like university

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,630
partners and some for profits and the

428
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,250
traditional for profits that are part of

429
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,420
these Risha research efforts

430
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,220
usually file patents do do some

431
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,140
proprietary stuff that never sees the

432
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,090
light of day because it's just to get

433
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,730
the money out of the European Commission

434
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,380
funding flow and we feel the need there

435
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,080
because we can add we can we will be

436
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,020
responsible for a work package that

437
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,870
integrates the research into open source

438
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,320
and into an existing open source

439
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,760
application so my focus I think the very

440
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,610
much complementary I think it's perfect

441
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,490
that you exist and you you you you

442
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,549
alright let's talk about just one one

443
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,890
last point is that we we want to get the

444
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,540
financial stuff right we want to make it

445
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,190
easy that people can see how much money

446
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,570
they have in their accounts do some

447
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,480
budgeting bookkeeping make it very easy

448
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,600
to interface give us receipts and invent

449
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,730
something that is scalable across many

450
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,830
projects and that can be used in varied

451
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,830
various different entities to handle the

452
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,850
management of of 50 projects or whatever

453
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,160
in in a nonprofit environment so that's

454
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,830
our focus and we need the work that

455
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,390
makiel is doing at the Commons

456
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,940
Conservancy because he's detailing out

457
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,679
all the decisions that the projects have

458
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,270
to make before they reach the point

459
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,400
where they can come to us and say okay

460
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,480
give us a bank account

461
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,010
okay I think I'm gonna troll this panel

462
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:37,860
a little bit okay okay so some wait so

463
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,960
hi I'm Karen Sandler I'm the executive

464
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,980
director of the software freedom

465
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,190
Conservancy in some ways we are the

466
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,870
oldest and newest organization on this

467
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,450
panel because we are a us-based

468
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,279
organization and being the software

469
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,899
freedom Conservancy but we're also

470
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:55,429
ramping up a Conservancy France so

471
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,149
software freedom Conservancy as a as the

472
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:01,679
u.s. organization has been around for a

473
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,649
while and has been active in Europe and

474
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:10,020
the UK for quite quite a while and you

475
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,850
know we've held assets in Europe and

476
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,159
done quite a number of things in Europe

477
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,890
and of course the participants of our of

478
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,289
our projects are global and I totally

479
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:20,760
agree with what s'en said before that

480
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,340
there's so much room for a lot of

481
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,860
different organizations but I think my

482
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,260
biggest role of this panel is to say

483
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,149
that I'm so glad that we've made it look

484
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,690
so exciting and fun that wants to do it

485
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,390
too but so and then I would say that

486
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,580
that that these problems are hard and

487
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,100
many of the the things that that you're

488
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,690
hearing are true of our organization too

489
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,470
we we have are the home of over 40 free

490
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,850
and open-source software projects

491
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,460
including get samba wine Inkscape

492
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,090
selenium PHP myadmin the list goes on

493
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,000
brew network stream owner I I'm always

494
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
told by my colleague Bradley that I

495
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,909
should not try to listen them because

496
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,700
then I'll just keep keep going and it's

497
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,559
hard to choose we're also the home of

498
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,630
rhe which is a diversity program for

499
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,850
women and other underrepresented people

500
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,990
in freeing up and source software and

501
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,029
participants are global there was one

502
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:18,510
round we do about like 90 interns per

503
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,250
year who come through our program and

504
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,649
there was at least one round where there

505
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:24,659
was one intern from each habitable

506
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,580
continent so a truly global program and

507
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,299
and we also are known for being the one

508
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,150
of our member project is the

509
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,400
coalition of kernel developers that

510
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,500
asked us to enforce their copyrights and

511
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,690
we have funded the lawsuit of Krista

512
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,460
Helwig in Germany against VMware so so

513
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,430
as you can see we are active globally

514
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,270
and the way it works with Conservancy is

515
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,220
that when a project applies to

516
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,080
Conservancy they become a part of our

517
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,300
organization we are their nonprofit

518
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,780
identity they are analogous to a like a

519
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,120
division of a corporation and part of

520
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,360
that arm boarding process and come in is

521
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,100
is some of the like virtualization ideas

522
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,590
of organization so when organizations

523
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,820
when people offer our projects and

524
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,250
communities join us we help them figure

525
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,830
out how their governance exists and

526
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,180
instead of having to form their own

527
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,550
organization they kind of they they form

528
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,890
a virtual organization within us where

529
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,280
they don't need to file a particular

530
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,400
form of organization with three members

531
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,020
on the board or whatever the the

532
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,150
particular laws are instead they can run

533
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,560
the project however it works for them

534
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,300
and within our remember projects that's

535
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,070
totally different from project project

536
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,860
some projects have big communities where

537
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,960
they run elections and some of our

538
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,990
projects just have a small committee of

539
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,270
five people who are three people who

540
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,520
always make their decisions by consensus

541
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,340
and we basically can tailor it project

542
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,430
by project so that's really really handy

543
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,100
we also I guess the bad news for

544
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,510
everybody here and I think everybody

545
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,890
here already knows it is that this is

546
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,550
really tough work and and not very

547
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,940
hazing overt sexy but it's not glamorous

548
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,270
well thank you it's it's it's it's hard

549
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,520
work it's thankless work and and it's

550
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,030
very hard to fund and I would be remiss

551
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,860
if I didn't mention that we have a

552
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,960
matched donation now and so if you

553
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
donate to Conservancy just for this week

554
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,440
there it's matched so it counts two

555
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,610
times I'm so sorry

556
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,570
but we need to fundraise from the public

557
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,280
in order to subsidize the work that we

558
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,330
do for our projects but we taken money

559
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,190
in a number of different ways from

560
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,780
sources all over the world so we have

561
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,460
some grant funding that we take in

562
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,190
individual donations

563
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,039
also around the world we're looking at

564
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,340
wrapping up conservancy France because

565
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,779
there's some flexibility for handling a

566
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,450
there's not a lot of things that that we

567
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,879
found that that we wanted to do that we

568
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,200
couldn't do with our own organization

569
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,149
but we just have a few things that will

570
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,090
be a little bit easier one of the main

571
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,970
things that we're doing is is creating a

572
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,429
system for tracking assets and

573
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:16,159
accounting that that will create a free

574
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,720
and open-source software solution that

575
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,279
everyone can use and this is a challenge

576
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,440
that that a lot of free and open source

577
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,359
software organizations have experienced

578
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,029
in this space that it's just it's the

579
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:28,970
mass of transactions is just huge like

580
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,009
because one of the things that free

581
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,440
software projects want to use this these

582
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,239
entities for are sending people to

583
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,369
conferences and each person that goes to

584
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,259
a conference has all these receipts and

585
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:40,429
they have receipts for their flight and

586
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,690
receipts for their hotel you have to

587
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,919
track each one and you have to make sure

588
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,599
that everything is is handled properly

589
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,309
not just for whatever rules you might

590
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,359
have to follow depending on your

591
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,279
jurisdiction but also to make sure that

592
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,769
we have decent governance transparency

593
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:52,849
and make sure that the funds are being

594
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:56,269
used properly so it's just incredibly

595
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,419
hard work and we've been focusing our

596
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,399
entire operations around making this in

597
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,679
a solvable way that is transportable for

598
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,149
everyone that actually leads in the

599
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:07,399
mining might my question for the panel I

600
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,779
just said I'm only going to ask one

601
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,639
question and then I'll open it up to the

602
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,229
audience just because you know the time

603
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:14,330
is getting kind of short so I'll just

604
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,669
ask each the panels to this question

605
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,739
what checks and balances do you have in

606
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:22,609
place so that we can trust you with our

607
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,590
assets both tangible and intangible in

608
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,529
other words how do we avoid repeating

609
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,940
history of like let's say the talks

610
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,900
foundation X augur openoffice.org

611
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,969
[Music]

612
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,970
kick to you yes those are all very

613
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,590
different disasters you mentioned that

614
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:50,620
so public software we we are a limited

615
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,679
liability company and we have to

616
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,720
maintain accounts like any other limited

617
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,570
liability company we additionally have

618
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,460
to file an annual report with the

619
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,320
Commissioner of Community Interest

620
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,809
companies in the UK where we demonstrate

621
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,600
that we are continuing to serve our

622
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,460
declared community on top of that what

623
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,230
we're also so we've got we have one

624
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,309
project and it has quite a low

625
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:16,539
transaction rate because it isn't

626
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:18,039
generally sending people to conferences

627
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,110
at the moment so at the moment we have a

628
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,080
public an open ledger that anyone in the

629
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,200
project can see and that is available

630
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,179
for all of the participants not just the

631
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,620
formal participants who signed the

632
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,450
contract but any of the project

633
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,250
participants to look at and they can see

634
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,850
exactly what assets we hold we hold all

635
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,129
their domain names and their trademarks

636
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,840
for them and they're in the register and

637
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,269
then we also hold all of their funds and

638
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,840
we identify all of the deductions that

639
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,610
have taken place from their funding so

640
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,330
that it that is all transparent that I

641
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,850
would say that the the the main check is

642
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,679
that transparency and the main balance

643
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,240
is the fact that we have a public duty

644
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,269
which is inspected by the government so

645
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,779
at the Nelnet we we've been running sort

646
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,549
of this same thing internally for about

647
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,620
twenty years so we give away money to

648
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,059
people they ask for it and he asked for

649
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,309
it in small chunks and so people have

650
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,200
been sending us receipts over and over

651
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,330
again and so this is something that we

652
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,110
have a person handling professionally

653
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,259
all the time we every decision that is

654
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:34,149
made is is is made through specific

655
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,850
process where all the the whole

656
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,860
governance body is notified so if

657
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,129
somebody sends in a receipt then that

658
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:43,990
would be a decision that everybody knows

659
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,250
of so

660
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,200
and that's an internal that's internal

661
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,620
mailing list for each project it's we're

662
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,690
just starting and it we're not we're not

663
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,790
so we're not sending lots of people out

664
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,350
on trips as well so but the the and it

665
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,090
would be just before the program for

666
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,470
each program right so not for every

667
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,690
program to receive all the traffic of

668
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,840
other programs but just from the five

669
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
people three people working inside as a

670
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,550
project so that it's just it's an open

671
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:19,670
book so yeah and yeah our guarantee is

672
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,210
that when we focus more on the larger

673
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,510
say you want to do some somebody has to

674
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,310
build some really boring testing

675
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,530
infrastructure and and and he has to be

676
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,960
working on this for six months and the

677
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,670
community decides to pay up for that

678
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,890
particular bit they they apply for

679
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,200
grants with us and then the whole

680
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,750
process is handled like it would be more

681
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,430
more grant so we dude do you do all the

682
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,920
checks and balances for the project to

683
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,110
make sure that it's it's stable and then

684
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,850
the project is called saying this is

685
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,220
what we've arranged with that person or

686
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,980
that company or whatever so yeah we

687
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,410
first the the professional management is

688
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,360
really important and as regards to the

689
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,380
assets basically everything that's

690
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,340
donated to us is sent through again to

691
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,750
that to this decision mailing this

692
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,730
incoming traffic is just there's an

693
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,460
oversight and there's a stack of things

694
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,780
so that you can just always look at it's

695
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,190
a right only mechanism all our

696
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,830
legislation and so on it's like a not a

697
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,480
blockchain but a blockchain like idea

698
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,550
where you can only tack on new versions

699
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:31,190
of new things I mean in the like Simon

700
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,900
said these cases that you mentioned had

701
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,850
a lot of different circumstances and

702
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,110
different reasons but I think there's

703
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,570
things to say about transparency in many

704
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,130
different angles as well and I think

705
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,960
that transparency is mostly something

706
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,270
that the project should the project

707
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,160
community should decide what kind of

708
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,850
level of transparency they want within a

709
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,160
guiding framework that helps them to

710
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,710
make useful good decisions that avoid

711
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,510
conflict in the future

712
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,180
and I think all these examples are more

713
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,330
problem of bad governance models or bad

714
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,090
adoption of structures within those

715
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,540
communities rather than a question of

716
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,200
transparency in these cases cases that

717
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,940
you mentioned transparency wasn't the

718
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,870
issue

719
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,540
and I mean we are a limited liability

720
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,670
company in Germany there's some filing

721
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,500
public filings that you have to do as a

722
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,230
limited liability company there's public

723
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,330
filings in the sense of the of the

724
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,180
charity status so you have to file an

725
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,000
annual report and the difficulty we have

726
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,190
is that the stuff will happen in German

727
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,010
the the interactions with the government

728
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,560
entities will happen in German and we

729
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,660
will make some effort to translate that

730
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,240
so an annual report will be published in

731
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,790
English that is very near to the

732
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,470
requirements of the German government

733
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,620
and I've been suggesting that we use the

734
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,010
formula 90 that is used in the US as a

735
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,330
template of something that we don't file

736
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,920
anywhere because we're not under the

737
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,260
jurisdiction but I think for anyone

738
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,960
who's familiar with the 501 C 3 s can

739
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,540
then look at because basically their

740
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,550
numbers and the details and the

741
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,460
narratives in the 990 are close to what

742
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,290
we have to file anyway so why not use

743
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,570
the form and produce something that is

744
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,610
very similar to that so that's that's a

745
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,500
but the minor thing about transparency

746
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,900
in some sense but I don't want to speak

747
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,230
for the projects that use us for example

748
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,750
the European Commission funding there is

749
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,940
si P in the consortium they have some

750
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,560
non-disclosure stuff happening they do

751
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,330
some proprietary stuff that we're not

752
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,760
even concerned about so we will have to

753
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,470
find the right balance there cut out the

754
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,600
stuff that but that's kind of the

755
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,490
decision in the consortium and the

756
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,070
decision that we have to make as far how

757
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,230
far do we want to go but we're not there

758
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,380
yet so I cannot really comment much on

759
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,990
that I have to say that's so exciting

760
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,600
that you're I'm so surprised and excited

761
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,740
to hear that you're thinking of using

762
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,500
990 as a template for information

763
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,060
elsewhere because we've been working on

764
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,200
nonprofit accounting

765
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
towards having just the accounting

766
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,340
system generate the 990 so if that's

767
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,110
useful in other places that's even

768
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,110
better like it's just that there's like

769
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,050
simple manipulation

770
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,560
of assets that you can you can script

771
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,710
and so it should be easy to fake form 99

772
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,760
you're not something that takes weeks

773
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,739
and weeks so so we're working towards

774
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,320
that for us for transfer as far as

775
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,500
oversight and assurance that we're doing

776
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,570
what we should be doing we have multiple

777
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,010
levels of that we have an evaluations

778
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,139
committee that evaluates that projects

779
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,210
that come in to Conservancy are a good

780
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,429
fit for Conservancy and they meet our

781
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,830
standards then we have an intake process

782
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,810
where each project is helped with their

783
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,330
governance and like marts was saying we

784
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,469
tell our all of these things for the

785
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,880
projects they may decide to do different

786
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,530
things but they all have to meet a

787
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,030
certain standard and we have to be sure

788
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,420
that there's not going to be any undue

789
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,680
influence by any one company or or some

790
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,800
other kind of control that we wouldn't

791
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,530
be comfortable with in a free software

792
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,270
project we have a board of directors

793
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,310
which oversees all of our work and we

794
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,660
have a charitable mission that we have

795
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,820
to be accountable for having an

796
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,080
organization like one of ours

797
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,390
participate with the free software

798
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,980
project means that there's a kind of an

799
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,960
outside party which means that when

800
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,380
there are kind of like inappropriate

801
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,140
things suggested that people tend to be

802
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,450
a little more sheepish and there's a

803
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,720
third party that that that somebody can

804
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,550
contact whistleblower considers say hey

805
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,990
you should look into that transaction

806
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,370
because I feel uncomfortable and it's

807
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,410
it's no problem at the same time when

808
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,880
you have problems that happen in some of

809
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,620
the examples that you mentioned where

810
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,930
you have like we don't have to worry as

811
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,270
much about not filing things or getting

812
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,830
things in time because we're doing it in

813
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,350
a consolidated way so all of that stuff

814
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,680
seems to really help ok well that that's

815
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,950
really great we have about five minutes

816
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,570
for questions so as Disney learned from

817
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,560
the audience have a question for the

818
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,830
panel

819
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,249
[Music]

820
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,079
[Music]

821
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:54,440
to start so the backstory in 2011 I

822
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,539
started a non-profit and that grew into

823
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:58,849
a network of nonprofits which are 20

824
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,219
organizations in 14 countries and that's

825
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,809
how ever I became quite familiar with

826
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:04,670
the different structures the different

827
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,949
nonprofit laws different charity

828
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:11,109
approaches and that unfortunately that

829
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,910
it spread that I knew about these things

830
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,949
so many who have been coming to me since

831
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,989
then to help them create the

832
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,029
organizational structures look into the

833
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,619
bylaws stuff and things like that I

834
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,239
think for the rest we should take that

835
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,819
offline but like the I think an

836
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:27,739
important point here for me for me legal

837
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,809
entities are tools and they shouldn't

838
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,239
become something for me you're creating

839
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,309
an a living organization and it wants to

840
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:37,130
eat and it wants to grow and anytime you

841
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,539
create a legal entity you need to be

842
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,180
careful to not turn it around that you

843
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,279
become a tool of the legal entity but

844
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:46,430
that the tools stay within like and to

845
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,769
use them properly so the tools that are

846
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,779
available to me at the moment are like

847
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:53,229
nonprofit associations a company

848
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,719
foundation and things like that so I

849
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,799
flex ability to help others so happy to

850
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:01,630
take this offline

851
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,920
more one more thing on the previous

852
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,199
question which which you you sort of

853
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,459
when you said that you can't you need to

854
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,019
make sure that the organization is the

855
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,789
is the tool one of the things that

856
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,410
Conservancy does on that front is that

857
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,850
we have very strong termination for

858
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,980
visions so our projects can leave easily

859
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,110
and we've helped many of our projects

860
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,040
leave either to form their own

861
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,860
organization or to do something else and

862
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,570
I think that that's a really important

863
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,980
part of transparency but it's a really

864
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,660
important part of fighting the right

865
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,680
governance structure to add on that is

866
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,810
not just leaving it's also splitting

867
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,670
apart because I think there's a gilded

868
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,780
cage where you're in we're in a

869
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,220
foundation there's some money there are

870
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,570
some assets there and the guy that

871
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,130
leaves is the guy that has nothing or

872
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,440
the girl that leaves so people tend to

873
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,840
fight over assets and we've we've

874
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,090
designed we went out or away spent a lot

875
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,530
of time in designing procedures to

876
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,080
basically also fork an organization so

877
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,750
that you can part just to have separate

878
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,790
ways so that each and every one can just

879
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,320
continue to do what they're good at

880
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,230
rather than to fight for either all or

881
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:14,330
nothing so it was a comment that mihail

882
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,240
made about people who sign which leads

883
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,760
to this question which is to me I was

884
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,680
sort of intrigued by the the ambiguous

885
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,230
nature we talk so loosely about projects

886
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,570
but in reality there are people and so

887
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,420
how do you decide how do you identify

888
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,760
who has authority to speak for the

889
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,280
project and I think Karin when you say

890
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,620
governance like eventually you force

891
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,000
them to that point but sort of how do

892
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,670
you manage even are the people I'm

893
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,500
talking to the right people and is there

894
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,940
somebody else who should be included in

895
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,070
this conversation and what kind of what

896
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,510
kind of legal commitments or what kind

897
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,130
of who can make the commitment and what

898
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,200
kind of commitments can they make so

899
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,030
first we've put this into lists so

900
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,440
everything is handled by lists so the

901
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,230
book at intake we have a quartermaster

902
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,050
that appoints somebody appoints a group

903
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,150
of people to be the governing body and

904
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,500
whatever they call it it doesn't matter

905
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,900
but it's a mailing list and we only

906
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,510
accept messages that are CC to the

907
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,490
mailing list so when there's a contest

908
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,970
within we recommend 48 hours but it can

909
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,710
be longer there's a contest of any

910
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,740
decision that goes over that list it's

911
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,040
it becomes something that has to be

912
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,290
redone it was no contest we can we can

913
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,920
take action

914
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,100
and so when organizations join public

915
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,410
software they they sign a service

916
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,410
agreement with us and that the entity

917
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,790
that is signing that agreement is an

918
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,400
unincorporated association in in UK law

919
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,500
which is the form that's used for things

920
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,180
like Cub Scout troops and in to identify

921
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,920
that unincorporated association we name

922
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,020
the individuals who are considered to be

923
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,400
that association in the legal agreement

924
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,830
and we make clear in the legal agreement

925
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,830
who is entitled to to speak for that

926
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,020
group of people on what topics and then

927
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,850
we only accept instructions from the

928
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,920
named individual or individuals who are

929
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,720
named in that agreement to take the

930
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,880
tasks so for travel spirit there is one

931
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,540
individual who has to agree when no

932
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,350
matter who asks to to dispatch an asset

933
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,660
that name individual has to be copied

934
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,640
and has to agree and they have made a

935
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,710
commitment in our in our service

936
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,540
agreement that they will consult the

937
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,730
other named parties on the document so

938
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,650
we do it by explicitly naming an

939
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,690
authorizer and by explicitly making that

940
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,090
authorizer responsible for getting

941
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:36,510
consensus from the other parties US law

942
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,940
comes from UK law so we have a very

943
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,400
similar approach we Nate we have an

944
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,110
agreement and the template that's

945
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,240
families for a moment for many of our

946
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,890
agreements we try to be as transparent

947
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,180
as possible so you can look on our

948
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,780
website and see an example of it and we

949
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,550
we also name the individuals that come

950
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,380
in and that the part the agreement

951
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,360
establishes a governance procedure so

952
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,310
that those were the initial people and

953
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,010
then the there's like a more legal

954
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,780
effectuating body that transfers but

955
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,460
there's still this question that I think

956
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,140
Pam is getting at which is how do you

957
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,300
know you have the right people right how

958
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,380
do you know those are original names are

959
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,460
and it was something that we struggled

960
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,320
with a lot and so we belt-and-suspenders

961
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,680
it so what we do is we take the project

962
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,750
whoever it perches us at face value and

963
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,210
and explore the community we read the

964
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,920
mailing list we check to make sure that

965
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,350
the people who are are talking to us are

966
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,870
in fact involved with the project but

967
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,900
then we take it a step further and we we

968
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,180
post messages on every possible place

969
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,520
that we can think of that or like a

970
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,590
thought like authoritative places where

971
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,330
these people are participating and say

972
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,580
this agreement is being signed these are

973
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,290
the people that are being identified if

974
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,570
you have any questions or object please

975
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,130
review all this stuff please let us know

976
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,230
and so we're pretty we're very confident

977
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,680
in the end and then similarly we have a

978
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,210
representative that is identified who

979
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,490
can speak and then we know the the the

980
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,080
committee or whatever governance body

981
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,090
that will identify that new person going

982
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:08,430
forward there is about exception and do

983
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,970
you think that do you provide or provide

984
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:17,280
order provided or some kind of exception

985
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,150
in within a European counties that what

986
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,660
we are going to accelerate the

987
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,180
involvement for business which work with

988
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,430
us also make profitable open-source at

989
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:32,880
reception would be great great way to to

990
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,400
get involved but do it exists as a

991
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,630
Italia as an Italian business may donate

992
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,690
some money to some kind of association

993
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,930
formation and get back some exception so

994
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,870
we aren't aware of any mechanism that is

995
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,080
devoted to public software at the moment

996
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,150
and we've we have we've talked about

997
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,430
setting up for example reciprocal

998
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,590
arrangements where you where somebody

999
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,360
British could donate to public software

1000
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,030
and Moritz would then pay money out in

1001
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,850
Germany to the that was and deduct tax

1002
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,890
there are actually already charitable

1003
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,660
organizations across Europe that do

1004
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,060
tax-deductible exchanges across Europe

1005
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,830
but they're typically set up for large

1006
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,800
donations so the costs that are with for

1007
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,080
example in the UK there is there is an

1008
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,090
organization that handles charitable

1009
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,450
giving on payrolls so as if your company

1010
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,270
offers to make a charitable donation on

1011
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,240
your behalf as a salary deduction they

1012
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,220
will then put the money into the hands

1013
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,780
of the charity that's involved and the

1014
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,930
fees that they charge for that are

1015
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,460
scaled to the amount of money that they

1016
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,690
think they're going to be transferring

1017
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,510
and they are beyond the means of most

1018
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,460
it's small donations for individuals

1019
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,320
they are suitable for trusts that are

1020
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,140
making grants but so it would be it

1021
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,160
would be feasible for exam

1022
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,140
two more for Moritz to make a grant a

1023
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,920
tax-deductible grant into the UK of you

1024
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,799
know the three thousand three thousand

1025
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,930
euros but it wouldn't be feasible for me

1026
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,109
to pay my fsfe fellows fee in Germany

1027
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:08,940
because I tried to I actually tried

1028
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,559
doing it and I found the fees that I got

1029
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:12,270
charged directly more than the fsfe

1030
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,059
fellow fee so I haven't done it again

1031
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:17,430
okay I'm gonna have to think it really

1032
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,869
very much for a pal thank our panelists

1033
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:19,830
please

1034
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:26,340
[Applause]
