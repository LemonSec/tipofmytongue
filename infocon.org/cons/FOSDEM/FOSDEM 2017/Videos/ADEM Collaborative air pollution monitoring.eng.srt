1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,598
welcome

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,770
that if this talk is going to be about

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,460
Adam Adam is Dutch for breathe and this

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,080
project has something to do with air

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,870
quality and breathing my name is doc

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,190
Reeves but only 23 minutes so I don't

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,390
talk about myself today

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,369
I'm not going to talk about Tom lap but

9
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,500
panel up is a up and again where

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,800
I live so that's like this we have lots

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,640
of stuff to play with

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,370
special in the sense that the you know

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,360
what this means

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,989
it's like electric schemes but it also

15
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,500
includes the bird like in coal mines

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,140
they used to have birds with them to

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,020
monitor air quality a little bit that

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,460
then there was something wrong with the

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,379
air quality and that's what actually we

20
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,859
want to present as well so the the other

21
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,949
project what we would like to do is

22
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:03,379
collect raw data in the first instance

23
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,770
raw data of air quality information and

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,320
we are focusing on finalists because

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,220
finalist is something that we don't have

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,009
a lot of information in the sense that

27
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,170
we do have some information but usually

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,290
it's on specific places where they have

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,240
the expensive equipment to monitor and

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,159
indent for instance there are only two

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,110
places in the whole of the whole city of

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,140
ghent where they are measuring the

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,540
quality of the air and on the location

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,970
of these measuring measurement devices

35
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,750
is you know it's it's very strange that

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,549
we're putting put in the park and stuff

37
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,860
like that which doesn't represent

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,110
necessarily the quality of what you

39
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,380
would like to know we think that air

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,340
quality only makes sense it's like

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,110
nuclear reactors you have this personal

42
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,329
device that actually measures what

43
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,270
you're what you're exposed to so what we

44
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,560
would like to do is have something

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,039
similar in the sense that we can make

46
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,260
something that tells you where you are

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,449
what the air quality is obviously it may

48
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,970
not be exactly because it's it's very

49
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,390
dependent on lots of things but if we

50
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,130
can collect a lot of information and

51
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,690
we've tried we're going to do it by

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,580
having a device that you can mount on

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,040
your bike if we can collect a lot of

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,340
information during the day and we can we

55
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,560
can use that information together we can

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,780
enhance that information because we get

57
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,540
a lot of that information we can maybe

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,240
get we can maybe collect information

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,500
that while the the components we use may

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,450
not give you exact information because

61
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,820
we get so much information we can we can

62
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,560
get better results from that that's what

63
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,700
we want are you going to get more

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,560
information in the first place because

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,600
then maybe data scientists can use that

66
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,390
information to to put it on a map and do

67
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,220
things with it that we didn't envision

68
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,880
so most important thing today is the

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,830
device itself so I'm not going to talk

70
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,070
about the house obviously finders is

71
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,510
only one of the things you can measure

72
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,850
about air quality but it's one of the

73
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,310
things that like I said there's not that

74
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,200
much information of it and the quality

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,780
of little formations it's it's debatable

76
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,739
also for fine best the World Health

77
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,390
Organization and European Union they

78
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,519
have also debatable levels that are that

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,560
are acceptable for instance in Europe

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,380
the first 35 days that are measured that

81
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,330
exceed a certain level are not taken

82
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,070
into account so that's a really strange

83
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,519
way of measuring things because makes no

84
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,739
sense so you can have very high levels

85
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,980
of fine dust for instance and those are

86
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,890
not counted for 35 days only the 36 days

87
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,110
taking into account very strange but

88
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,760
it's because obviously fine dust is a

89
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,230
problem and so there are different kinds

90
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,500
of fungus you have PM 10 which is 10

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,989
micrometers you have PM two-and-a-half

92
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,200
and PM 1 and all of these have a

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,950
different kind of of body so that it's

94
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,980
sense of how it's dangerous the PM 10

95
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,800
is you can breathe in but it doesn't go

96
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,839
as deep as phases p.m. two and a half

97
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,350
those can get into your bloodstream even

98
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,180
if it's if it's getting worse

99
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,790
ultrafine particles they go directly

100
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,370
into your bloodstream even not directly

101
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,550
to the lungs but even though fine dust

102
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,060
may not be caused by human activity

103
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,190
alone you also have fine dust obviously

104
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,460
that nature produces so fine dust is not

105
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,910
necessarily always related to to us to

106
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,780
to to cause to to hit central heating

107
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,110
systems and stuff like that but it's one

108
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,730
of the indicators that air quality is

109
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,480
not that good

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,670
so again if the nice city of Ghent we

111
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,980
have lots of students lots of bikes a

112
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,990
lot of people use bikes I think in

113
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,500
Belgium dentists is probably the most

114
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,230
the city where people use about the most

115
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,660
but we also fortunately have a highway

116
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,640
going almost directly into the city and

117
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,770
I'm living above the highway so I have

118
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,120
this project probably you all have these

119
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,710
concerns where you're living especially

120
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,500
in cities or highways like I said nearly

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,560
averages or daily averages don't mean

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,830
it's it's the exposure you get your for

123
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,930
yourself that makes a lot of sense the

124
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,400
things that we would like to get is that

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,010
we have a good indication one for

126
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,660
instance it's good to open the windows

127
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,990
to clean the air in your house sometimes

128
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,380
you know from the weather that's the air

129
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,120
quality is bad but sometimes it's

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,570
related to something closer to you so it

131
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,340
would be nice to be able enough to tell

132
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,470
when it's best to open your windows

133
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,480
people do it usually late early evening

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,370
but that's in the winter that's that's

135
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,020
worse because the central heating

136
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,510
systems everybody's burning

137
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,810
gasps or whatever hoots and then the

138
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,550
equities even worse than during the day

139
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,040
when there was just traffic so it really

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,170
depends on you have to measure in house

141
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,060
and out of the house to be able to know

142
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,960
if it's better at the device this is one

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,840
of the first designs where all the

144
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,130
components were put together

145
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,740
it changed the bits we're going to see

146
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,330
what what you have to change but this is

147
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,310
how it looked how it would be put

148
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,920
together in the first open have to wear

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,530
open firmware and also the devices put

150
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,110
together that's also dude also will be

151
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,780
open you already have played with that

152
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,210
as well because it's a track next to the

153
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,660
technical part we're using as much as

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,010
possible open source wipes I don't have

155
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,270
to tell you that here because everybody

156
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,360
is doing that here at this place as

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,010
cheap as possible and if we have time I

158
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,570
will show you the bill of material I

159
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,970
hope we can get it can make a device

160
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,930
like this for 40 euros new devices that

161
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,570
measure it is in a scientific way they

162
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,320
easily costs 1000 years or more so this

163
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,690
would make a difference for us this is

164
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,600
also an earlier design I didn't make a

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,270
picture of the latest one but this is

166
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,670
basically how it works we use the the

167
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:53,360
spark fill esp8266 so the sensor at the

168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
top is the is the finest sensor it can

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,610
measure two and a half micrometers and

170
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,460
one micrometers a particulate matter

171
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,640
that is in between those in that range I

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
will show you how that works later on

173
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,110
there is a GPS in there because we

174
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,230
obviously have to locate where we are we

175
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,980
have a better we have lights to give

176
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,960
some indication to the user itself

177
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,270
because we think that we get more users

178
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,790
if the users have feedback themselves as

179
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,430
well if they have a personal interest

180
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,260
and then we have a humidity sensor

181
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,210
temperature is also in all of these

182
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,310
accelerometers to see when we are moving

183
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,169
that's important for the device as well

184
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,710
and

185
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,919
it's the protocol at a pressure sensor

186
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,830
as well and why are we collecting that

187
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,570
information is well it's because that's

188
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,150
might influence the information you get

189
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,160
from the from the air quality well the

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,100
finders sensor we don't know yet but in

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,590
relations we do a bit on scientific

192
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,480
papers that are written about the sense

193
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,090
we were using but we want to be able to

194
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,960
to verify ourselves based on your data

195
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,590
as well and obviously based on

196
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,670
calibrated material so like I said we

197
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,290
have a microcontroller which is the

198
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,870
spark from esp8266 the reason why we

199
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,300
took that one is because it has Rafi and

200
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,010
that's the most important thing in this

201
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,140
case because in the earlier designs we

202
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,550
were thinking about using bluetooth but

203
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,820
that's a lot more of a hassle like I

204
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,680
said - finders meter we did we did try a

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
lot of sensors I think we bought five or

206
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,620
six sensors also the there was a better

207
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,280
one in the PPD 42 sternness which is

208
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,500
more expensive obviously but we didn't

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,840
see that there was that it was much

210
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,400
better in the results that we wanted to

211
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,150
have so what is important to say in the

212
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,420
latest design we have started to use a

213
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,510
second micro controller to be able to

214
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,720
convert from the GPS to I square C I'm

215
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,280
going to come back to this why we're

216
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,560
doing this like this I'm not front of

217
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
the ID but that's the only affordable

218
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,050
way to do it at the moment the finders

219
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,000
sensor is very important because it's

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,570
the the base basis of everything one of

221
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,680
the things I have to mention as well

222
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,930
we're now doing fine best in future

223
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,270
designs when this is all working and we

224
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,580
have spare time we're going to probably

225
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,830
add other sensors as well because the

226
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,720
design allows it it's a modular design

227
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,090
you can add more sensors to the I Square

228
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,460
C bus so that's that we can do as well

229
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,530
but we first want to focus on this and

230
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,170
get something working what's important

231
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,570
about the sensor the sensor works by

232
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,020
sending out emitting infrared light we

233
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,700
have a lens that's an a sensor where the

234
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,940
light is being reflected too and it

235
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,510
counts well it gets the princess based

236
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,180
on what the sensor

237
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,470
receives and the sensor itself already

238
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,780
has some fine tuning all right you see

239
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,060
that here it has two potentiometers to

240
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,010
able to tweak it but it's the only tweak

241
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,800
at the factory so we don't have to use

242
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,610
that the air goes in here there was a

243
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,040
resistor to heat up the air so you have

244
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,670
an airflow for standalone devices in our

245
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,140
case we probably weren't gonna use the

246
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,820
resistor and we're going to use some

247
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,730
effect to have an intake of air

248
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,380
automatically so that we don't need a

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,910
resistor which will save the battery

250
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,230
what do I have to tell about this as

251
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,190
well well the the PPD 60 and SS does

252
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,310
have two sensors if I'm correct so that

253
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,900
this does not measure black matter

254
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,760
that's the only problem with this sensor

255
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,040
the other problem with this sensor

256
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,200
because doesn't reflect light obviously

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,820
the second problem that this sensor is

258
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:55,250
the fact that I wanted to say yes

259
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,420
normally in scientific organization

260
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,090
standards of acceptable levels they

261
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,630
measure fine dust by measuring the

262
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,250
weight obviously this doesn't measure

263
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,560
weight it only measures the size of

264
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,510
particles and so that's one of the

265
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,460
problems if we do it this way it's it's

266
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,470
in less scientific but obviously if you

267
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,630
want to measure weight you have to you

268
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,370
have to collect the dust and you have to

269
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,620
weigh it and that's impossible to do in

270
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,300
real time and that's the reason why

271
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,250
these real devices are so expensive

272
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,680
there are better devices in this one

273
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,810
using lasers and better techniques and

274
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,310
stuff like that but those are also very

275
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,790
expensive this one is not calibrated so

276
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,040
the calibrations one of the things we

277
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,050
have to do ourselves by buying

278
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,680
calibrated devices and maybe based on

279
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,720
statistics and where you are and if you

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,610
pass a calibrated device we can take

281
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,300
that into account if a bicycle cyclists

282
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,430
cross each other we can take that into

283
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,410
account if some of them have just passed

284
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,660
us

285
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,519
calibrate the device things like this

286
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,120
are possible but we are not counting in

287
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,029
this case the weight of the fine fine

288
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,670
dust but we're only counting particles

289
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:18,579
and the sizes of particles I myself

290
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,899
don't like I don't like the framework

291
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,220
maybe it's better because it was a new

292
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,110
release I've noticed that yet but we

293
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,149
also use a platform IO and that's less

294
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,000
easier to work with and we do the CI

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,860
testing a telepathy and github with

296
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,209
platform io components can be swapped so

297
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:36,740
that's the nice thing about a square

298
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,029
Siebels we also want to have a driver

299
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,589
selection so if you have different kind

300
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,269
of devices you can just plug them in and

301
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,550
if we support them they will be scanned

302
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,610
automatically in this as good as that is

303
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:57,110
possibility IDs accept contributions we

304
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,610
have a state machine obviously this is

305
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,399
already implemented and everything is

306
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,350
actually implemented now that the

307
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,689
integration we didn't do a lot of

308
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:07,519
testing yet because we want to get rid

309
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,079
of the bad box we want to have we have

310
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,269
to PCB designs yet but have been

311
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,430
produced yet unless we have everything

312
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,980
working on a breadboard first but we're

313
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,949
very close to that now so let me quickly

314
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,420
do this because this is nice because you

315
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,579
have an idea what it does when you start

316
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,959
that obviously it has to do some

317
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,180
initialization and it directly goes into

318
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,009
sleep mode in the sense that it's not

319
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,240
doing anything and everything is

320
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,920
disabled except accelerometer which is

321
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,040
always on as soon as you are moving we

322
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,980
go into some sort of GPS test mode where

323
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,540
we try to get a fixed for the GPS

324
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,850
because that's not certain and once we

325
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,130
get a GPS fix then we start to collect

326
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,750
because it doesn't make sense to collect

327
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,980
information if you don't know where we

328
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,199
are obviously if one of those two are

329
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,009
gone

330
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,110
we go back if you shake it we go to into

331
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,319
conflict modes that opens a beefy access

332
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,910
point where you can configure what are

333
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,520
they we fee as

334
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,339
credentials and buzzers IDs that you're

335
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:26,140
going to use for connecting to work we

336
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,089
go into test mode if we have data

337
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,350
collected so only if you have data

338
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,010
collected we will see if we have miffy

339
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,930
if we have we fear with us or 30 every

340
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,160
30 minutes or something like that we

341
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,510
have to see what's what's acceptable

342
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,790
then we applied and as soon as it's

343
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,230
applied we go back into sleep so that's

344
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,110
that's very simple it's it's there are

345
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,970
certain cases where we probably want to

346
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,380
do things differently if you go into a

347
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:58,270
tunnel maybe we went to okay the current

348
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,149
device like a set design was done before

349
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,520
I even joined the project but this

350
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,950
changed a bit the components were

351
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,610
already evaluated before I joined so

352
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,079
obviously for we're making the right

353
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:11,709
choices

354
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,209
I still have seven minutes that's fine

355
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,839
prototype which is still black dog based

356
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,480
which also has its own problems because

357
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,190
you know you have these cables that I

358
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,620
got always making the right connections

359
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,779
or there is less of a lot of information

360
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,209
things like that I'm not that technical

361
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,190
I'm not into electronics as much as I

362
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,170
probably should be in this post at this

363
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,980
point but ever

364
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,899
we're working on a team doing this alone

365
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,450
so we have a second piece of the design

366
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,180
already created which also is committed

367
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,970
to the second microcontroller we also

368
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,430
have have redesigned the casing because

369
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,610
of the connections in those days by

370
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,440
making something and see how this which

371
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,930
you can and we also made it a bit small

372
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,510
the idea is to use a standard tube size

373
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,270
that is transparent but not too

374
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,369
transparent so the lights are reflected

375
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,760
towards

376
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,630
so that to be don't we to make it's

377
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,460
gonna be mounted on this bicycle it

378
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,750
could be waiting in weather conditions

379
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,970
so we have to make sure that it is it's

380
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,849
properly sealed and so if you take a

381
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,680
champ which doesn't have any openings on

382
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
the side then you only have to care

383
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,180
about the front and the back and that's

384
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,340
going to be truly printed at first and

385
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,440
we already have a design where

386
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,410
everything is fitted at the back we have

387
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,690
access points for cables and in this

388
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,210
case moment for testing stuff and in the

389
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,070
front that will only be something that

390
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,410
where air gets gets in and that's also

391
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,530
very in the sense that how will this

392
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,750
survive extreme weather conditions or

393
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,930
long usage we still have to see we have

394
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,270
ideas about that as well but it's too

395
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,040
many to go into we have a lot of issues

396
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,170
as usual by these kinds of things we had

397
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,820
one of the reasons to go to a second

398
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,220
microcontroller you could in other ways

399
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,410
but by having a second microcontroller

400
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,780
that only does the GPS at the moment

401
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,340
only there's a GPS but in the future it

402
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,650
could do other things as well we can

403
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,730
offload the the GPS handling on that

404
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,890
second micro control that's one of the

405
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,650
advantages but the the the most

406
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,460
interesting part is the fact that you

407
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,770
have to write to Foreman works one for

408
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,380
that microcontroller obviously and they

409
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,970
have to work together and that was one

410
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,320
of the other problems that we had

411
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,170
we also problems with imperfect signals

412
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,790
one of the things is that for instance

413
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,790
our sensor expects 5 volt and at the

414
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,820
moment we have battery that can go up to

415
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,450
4.2 volts I think so we probably have to

416
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,380
use a better battery in the future we

417
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,910
still don't know because we haven't

418
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,670
looked at the data the sensor is

419
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,590
collecting yet we first want to finish

420
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,040
it and then we all to the real testing

421
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,630
we did of obviously do some things with

422
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,220
it but we don't know what the effect is

423
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,440
of our giving tree the tree volts or

424
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,560
more bit more to the device because

425
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,830
obviously if the light is too weak

426
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,480
the results will be influenced so we

427
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
have to see how that how that adds up in

428
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:34,330
the total well as well we had some

429
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,660
issues with the ESP stability but also

430
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,120
the fact that because it has to give

431
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,630
time to the raphy the integrated mushy

432
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,660
stuff that for I square C communications

433
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,820
we had a lot of problems that we didn't

434
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,650
understand we found lots of people that

435
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,390
were having the same problems and then

436
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,730
we found what to issue us and we could

437
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,890
fix it we are to change the I square C

438
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,190
library a bit to make it work in a

439
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,700
stable way so let's see there are lots

440
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,800
of things we would like to do we have

441
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,380
lots of organisations that are very

442
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,850
interested in this and this

443
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,230
possibilities that that we have with

444
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,890
this device collecting quality

445
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,350
information by if you have bumps and a

446
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,240
lot of bicycles have the same bumps at

447
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,730
the same location we could probably do

448
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,210
something unit and quality sensors like

449
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,270
I said obviously when you have a moving

450
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,220
device we could also make stationary

451
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,690
device it's a little bit different

452
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,060
because we may not include the GPS but

453
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,260
we still want to know where we are

454
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,240
so I still have to see how we would do

455
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,250
that but it would be nice to have this

456
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,230
as well obviously if it's outside of the

457
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,430
house we do want to have that

458
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,260
information if it's inside of the house

459
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,610
obviously we don't want to that

460
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,770
information but maybe we may still

461
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,420
collect it and show it to the user

462
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,540
because the raw data is not usable by

463
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,790
normal people because it's you have to

464
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,290
see that in the global picture of all

465
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,910
the data that we measured both the

466
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,620
calibrated stuff and a non calibrated

467
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,020
stuff but the stationary devices if we

468
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,440
have if they're spread out through the

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,660
city it would be nice to calibrate those

470
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,780
maybe ourselves from time to time so

471
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,810
that those are also giving a better

472
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,310
indication of the air quality and those

473
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,250
can be used when cyclists pass by

474
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,320
to correlate air quality with weather

475
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,870
conditions so that in the future we can

476
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,400
also predict based on the predictions of

477
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,990
what the weather is going to be what

478
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,420
also the air quality will be based on

479
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,060
obviously if it's a normal day weekend

480
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,700
and whatever because a quality like I

481
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,740
said it's important to do that close to

482
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,360
where you are because it doesn't matter

483
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,290
if they're only to collect X where the

484
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,230
information is gathered it's it's no use

485
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,220
it depends what you're feeding them the

486
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:21,130
reason I'm saying that is that some

487
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,940
interest for using advertisement space

488
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,520
that is underused to give that sort of

489
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,230
information as well which would be nice

490
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,220
and in a train station we could also

491
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,010
display the information in between in

492
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,840
between because one of the things that's

493
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,600
important is that you can get people

494
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,150
interested in these matters as well or

495
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,610
and if one minute left side they maybe I

496
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,380
can give a demo later on if you

497
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,640
interested go somewhere else if you're

498
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,750
interested to help you're looking for

499
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,220
more people to join as well now that the

500
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,600
device is almost finished we need

501
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,430
obviously people that also want to test

502
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,670
drive around help with integrating and

503
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,190
stuff like that like myself no prior

504
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,990
knowledge is required and you know not

505
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,420
okay this is the information if you're

506
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,520
interested take a picture now the slides

507
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,110
will be up somewhere the video will be

508
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,420
up somewhere

509
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,060
let me quickly see if there is something

510
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,010
a lot of other projects are going on as

511
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,750
well we learn from that as well because

512
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,510
I'm it may seem that I'm a little bit

513
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,570
superficial over all the stuff that it's

514
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,580
based on other projects as well and it's

515
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,050
just that we don't have a lot of time

516
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,389
yes questions quickly yeah

517
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,940
yeah correct

518
00:23:49,940 --> 00:24:06,890
so it's magic question yeah so the

519
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,919
question was that the data sheets say

520
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,230
that five fold is needed there can be

521
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,679
10% difference and we know that there is

522
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,179
an issue that it's special that the

523
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,770
information we collect when it's more

524
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,799
work also relates to the output we get

525
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,600
but we want to have five fold for this

526
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,700
definitely yeah that's why we're looking

527
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,410
for different batteries and stuff like

528
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,210
that so maybe I'm sorry to interrupt you

529
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,000
we can take other questions outside so

530
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,679
that we don't shift the schedule to

531
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,200
obviously presentation
