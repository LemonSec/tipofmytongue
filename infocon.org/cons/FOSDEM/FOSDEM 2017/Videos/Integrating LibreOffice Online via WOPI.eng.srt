1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,449
oh I

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,689
I'm here to present you something about

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,639
Libre Office online

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,410
I'm your host chef Sookie I work for

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,570
kelabra and it's awesome to have you all

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,880
here so what is it libreoffice online

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,610
maybe you have seen the announcement

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,970
with the 5.3 that actually now we are

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,510
like shipping libreoffice online so in

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,520
the upstream version it's actually two

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,920
things one is that it's a source release

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,370
so you can build your your like packages

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,800
out of that but also there's a docker

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,229
image that you can integrate into your

15
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,530
web application and use it like your for

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,010
your for your service that you probably

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,149
are running or using or or anything so

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,059
this talk will be about how to do such

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,699
an integration so first of all like

20
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:58,719
libreoffice online

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,100
looks like this so you can you can have

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,360
some text here some some papers and

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,570
pictures all the things that you would

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,210
expect in the in the online suit it is

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,100
also possible for two people to actually

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,360
connect together and very

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,840
collaboratively in one document which i

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,230
think is some something nice

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,540
also you can deploy it like behind your

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,390
VPN so like it is not necessary to have

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,910
some some outside service and some you

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,430
know whatever other people's computers

33
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,430
you can have it all inside your like

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,430
business or school infrastructure or

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,090
anything so how to do the integration

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,290
oops sorry I have two screens set up and

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,500
does it show anything No

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,790
yeah okay

39
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,720
so it is actually very easy to do the

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,060
integration so you first install the

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,690
LibreOffice online and well do a bit of

42
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,780
setup so that it works in the or VM a VM

43
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,810
and like you are able to see that that

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,030
you are connecting to it to that then in

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,460
your application that that provides the

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,120
data you implement some relatively

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,630
trivial arrest API so that the liberal

48
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,580
fees online can actually like download

49
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,000
or upload files then you modify your

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,630
replication so that so that like you put

51
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,210
the iframe that contains what the user

52
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,360
actually sees like into into the look

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,670
and feel of your application and then

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,399
you profit so

55
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,780
to to fast for a tall say so let's see

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,410
what is actually develop a protocol what

57
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,190
we protocol is is a specification that

58
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:16,330
says how how like how is it possible for

59
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,530
an application to to like talk to your

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,360
that data get them or upload them

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,890
actually one of the implementations or

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,780
the first implementation of this was

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,470
office 365 and we are using very similar

64
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,769
protocol as them so I think to some

65
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,630
extent like if there's some some

66
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,230
somebody who actually uses office 365 in

67
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,080
their application we are more or less

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,019
dropping a replacement for that

69
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,720
so LibreOffice online is about big

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,269
client so it is something that that can

71
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,750
like create and and try this data and be

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,050
integrated the documentation for this

73
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,110
Volpe is quite extensive so like

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,720
whatever you do not here in my talk you

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
can see it in the in the documentation

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,700
and in the specification here is a

77
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,100
picture how it actually looks like so

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,089
here is what the user sees so there's

79
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,040
there's some kind of your web

80
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,980
application so you know some

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,350
buttons and you know maybe sidebar or

82
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,630
anything and they're there then there's

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,980
a place for the LibreOffice online so

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,710
you will implement it as an iframe and

85
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,980
this iframe will on will will

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,960
communicate with the with the server

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,860
part of a flipper office online which in

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,380
the whoopi and terms is called what we

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,660
client which provides the extra editing

90
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,720
so it will provide data for the iframe

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
so that it like looks like the document

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,430
you can see the selections there and all

93
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,640
these things on this on the other hand

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,220
for your web application you have to

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,130
implement some part some part in the on

96
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,220
the server as well which in the very

97
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,380
terms is called what we host which

98
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,570
provides the data so this is where you

99
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,390
will have the endpoints and

100
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,950
authentication part and everything that

101
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,640
that actually deals with the data and

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,920
bopi client will be talking to this what

103
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,880
we host like independent from the web

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,190
application and they'll download or

105
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,820
upload upload the data as as like you

106
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,090
are saving or if there's how to save how

107
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,480
is how is how to saving there's a

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,390
reference implementation which you can

109
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,830
see on github which like folder for the

110
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,590
boppie host that part is implemented in

111
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,040
in PHP and JavaScript is used for the

112
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,710
for for the other parts like for for the

113
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,650
iframe itself the rest endpoints are

114
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,530
quite trivial so when you have a

115
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,440
document that you need to download you

116
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,700
will just wow the URL needs to look like

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,210
this so hope you what we host URL so

118
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,040
that's the server part you need to talk

119
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,940
to you then that can be anything random

120
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,900
in between more slashes or anything but

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,340
then like has to be aboard huapi and

122
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,530
then again it can continue like with

123
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,910
anything

124
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,040
you can you can just define that but

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,110
then after that it has to be defined as

126
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,030
files then ID of the of the file and

127
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,280
content and access token access token is

128
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,650
something that makes sure that that that

129
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,320
the user actually has right to access

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,440
the data so it is something that is that

131
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,060
is issued by the by your web application

132
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,820
that controls the the X s so the the

133
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,620
like Libre Office online never asks for

134
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,770
a password because because like it is

135
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,610
not its responsibility it really just

136
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,500
uploads and downloads data and it is the

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,320
responsibility of the of the of your

138
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,230
application that actually integrates

139
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,780
like Libre Office and online it's inside

140
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,320
that will like on one hand tell the

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
devotee client like this is the access

142
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,250
token and then the ropey client will

143
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,190
talk to - ok host and like in that case

144
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,440
we know that everything is authenticated

145
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,500
and everything is fine and like the user

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,680
has the has the rights to to actually

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,450
actually access the document uploading

148
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,060
back it's very similar to that like

149
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,210
again some path contents access token

150
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,390
again important part of that check file

151
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,090
info is one additional thing that you

152
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,120
actually have to provide because like we

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,419
are talking about the fastest IDs

154
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,690
there's no way how to how to know for

155
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,790
example the the name of the actual file

156
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,380
so like it will be very like transparent

157
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,140
here so the check file info like when

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,840
you when you ask for that again the file

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,180
ID you will get the information how the

160
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,490
file is big like what's its size in

161
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,330
bytes what is the name of the file if it

162
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,270
is really only some additional

163
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,610
information you can work with in your in

164
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,409
your application and and the online

165
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,990
it has to work with that information as

166
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,210
well because like for example do I have

167
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,610
to look a bit different when the

168
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,860
document is read only the security token

169
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,500
so I've introduced that just a bit

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,430
already so it is there just to just to

171
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,010
like leave the authentication itself on

172
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,050
somebody else and that is on on your

173
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,560
part of the application so the security

174
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,350
token like from the implementation point

175
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,740
of view can be just like very random

176
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,700
thing it can be like characters and and

177
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,710
numbers from our point of view it is

178
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,260
like not necessary to do have any like

179
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,650
strict form or be this big or this short

180
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,200
anything so it it just works and well of

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,090
course obviously the important part is

182
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,760
that it has to be generated according to

183
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,390
the to the user so that like two users

184
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,990
do not have the same access token and

185
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,820
also like you can provide some time to

186
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,190
live for this token so you can make sure

187
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,590
that that you know after half an hour

188
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,570
like the developer host has to provide

189
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,970
just new access token so that the

190
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,630
communication just continues discover

191
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,830
service is like the third thing that

192
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,350
well one more thing that that that is

193
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,880
here and that actually provides

194
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,390
information about like very exactly the

195
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:26,950
puppy host is located so it it says it

196
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,070
serves some kind of XML and it says okay

197
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,800
the Volpe host has this URL and sits on

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,230
this port so that it is possible for the

199
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,960
puppy client to actually like know very

200
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,730
decent and and see see what is what is

201
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,690
going on there in there

202
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,510
on the JavaScript side of things it is

203
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,280
it is necessary to create the iframe

204
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,440
that contains the LibreOffice online

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,970
here is very you will actually provide

206
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,850
the access token to do libreoffice

207
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,900
online via a post method so that it's

208
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,540
like can remember that and then it can

209
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,170
it can talk to the to the copy host

210
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,760
itself so we are nearly finished so how

211
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,390
to actually implement it when you get to

212
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,530
that because I fear that I've used lots

213
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,050
of terms here that that maybe they're

214
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,810
like not easy to to consume in a short

215
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,630
time so basically when you are

216
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,490
implementing this you should do it in

217
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,280
small steps first as well so first of

218
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,470
all you do not want to connect to some

219
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,050
storage you just want to like return

220
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,050
some random well not that random you

221
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,430
just want to return some message

222
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,350
helloworld or anything by your Voki host

223
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,030
without connecting to authentication

224
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,550
without without connecting to your real

225
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,080
data so so you will skip the the hard

226
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,470
parts first and you just make sure that

227
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,930
like when you open your web application

228
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,550
with the iframe that contains the the

229
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,740
[Music]

230
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,040
the libreoffice online will see the

231
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,290
libreoffice online actually comes up and

232
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,270
you will see the message whole world

233
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,730
there so these are the first three steps

234
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,920
so that's the rest endpoint they just

235
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,130
answers whole world then a very small

236
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,740
check file info that is that just says

237
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,560
okay hello world dot txt is the file

238
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,770
name and it has 11 bytes as the as the

239
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,450
length of the message and that's done

240
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,480
and then we will implement just just

241
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,440
very small iframe that that posts post

242
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,560
the query for for this file and then

243
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,750
when you have it you can actually extend

244
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,670
it and

245
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,579
on that so so instead of returning just

246
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,740
just random hello world you will

247
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,470
actually like use some some real real

248
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,440
data or some real ODS file or all DT and

249
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,570
then okay also you will you will of

250
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:20,329
course built in the the like sending and

251
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,640
receiving the access token so that like

252
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,610
you really are able to do do it safely

253
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,290
and make sure that only the user who has

254
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,070
the access rights gets the document so

255
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:56,620
that's it any questions

256
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,250
well it doesn't have to be it is just

257
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,490
recommended because because the deliver

258
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,930
first online can like to take quite lots

259
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,310
of resources because it does the

260
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,260
rendering of the of the tasks and and

261
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,220
the things so it is better that you have

262
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,470
it on separate VM or anything so that

263
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,440
like in case something goes wrong you

264
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,870
just do not trip disrupt the service of

265
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,899
providing fuss about other means so it's

266
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,970
recommended but it's doesn't have to be

267
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,579
on separate machine because it's it's on

268
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,850
different ports than the normal like

269
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,209
HTTP so so it's possible to be on one

270
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,190
machine it's just like convenient to

271
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,970
have it on different

272
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,390
[Music]

273
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:21,140
okay not really because like for these

274
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,360
two machines they just exchange files

275
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,970
between themselves so it is usual that

276
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,110
like for them it is local local network

277
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,200
so like it is fast but even if it is not

278
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,020
fast like it will be that the the

279
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,300
download and upload of the of the of the

280
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,480
files is slower but it doesn't affect

281
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,210
the the editing speed or anything the

282
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,720
editing itself like depends on the on

283
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,390
the on the speed of the machine that it

284
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,760
renders the tasks like quickly enough

285
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,620
and of course on the speed of the

286
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,850
connection between you as the client or

287
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,380
somebody who who actually as the user

288
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,770
and and and the machine that that serves

289
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,779
so the libreoffice online

290
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,000
[Laughter]

291
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,740
yes of so um cloud next cloud have dam

292
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:40,990
of pie do then a co-op see file so at

293
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:57,850
least well not really because it's it's

294
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,740
just the rest endpoints that you have to

295
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,380
that then have to be specific to the to

296
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,880
the solution that actually serves the

297
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,790
fast so like I actually do not see how

298
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,309
how it could be done specific like we

299
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,650
could do it as like having some example

300
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,290
code like how it should look like in in

301
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,829
PHP how it should look like in in peyten

302
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:33,130
in in what not but I yeah it could be

303
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:50,080
from yeah from system if yeah if you

304
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,010
want if it is just just for testing you

305
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,280
can enable editing your local files on

306
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,410
the machine where it runs like of course

307
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,020
like for some public use it is unsafe

308
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,940
because you will be able to see the

309
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,679
content of a DC password or or whatever

310
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,900
but like for testing you just enable it

311
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,480
in the etcö wst /all

312
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,160
has the it's XML and like there's a

313
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,790
setting enable file access force you

314
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,070
change it to true and and you can

315
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,010
immediately like put put any any phone

316
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,049
in there and for testing I think it's

317
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,130
you know

318
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,800
this is a strategy the main leads the

319
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,130
online source for - so which you should

320
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,700
make around

321
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,090
hmm so is the next one presenting now

322
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,260
okay thank you so much

323
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,569
[Applause]
