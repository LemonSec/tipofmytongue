1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,500
so I'm going to talk about the way

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,000
that we talk about free software legal

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,650
tools I don't have any there okay

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,150
so as many of you are probably aware

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,700
free software open sources has one which

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,350
is great which means we have lots of

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,230
folks sleep using the software but we

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,000
haven't quite gotten as much buy-in on

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,490
the tools and still we see either like a

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,730
complete blank slate or kind of using

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,160
the tools in not the best way or not the

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,310
way that we intended them to be used

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,379
this is a people's name the little

14
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,800
mermaid yeah okay so I read this story

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
on Alice obscura about this woman who

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,360
she lived at the Little Mermaid and what

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,520
she thought was I have to get my friend

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,530
who's a nautical history expert to watch

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,960
this movie with me so I can see how much

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
of what's going on in the little moment

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
is accurate from the shipwreck seen the

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,320
the spoiler is not very much right and

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,809
so I fear that we are in a similar

24
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,060
situation with free software legal tools

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,490
like we haven't had a Disney movie about

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,180
them yet I keep my fingers crossed but

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,490
but this is sort of the level of you

28
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,840
know understanding that we have

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,430
sometimes with these tools which is

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,920
really unfortunate so we spent a lot of

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,439
time making them so my name is Deb

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,030
Nichols and I work at the open invention

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,500
Network so I often get the opportunity

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,360
to talk to people about these things for

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,790
the first time they're like oh I figured

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,650
we just leave all the legal stuff to

37
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,079
like next year and I'm like wow that is

38
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,829
a stunningly bad idea don't do that and

39
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,579
so so I get to hear a lot of the result

40
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:44,829
of what happens when we don't do a great

41
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,750
job of messaging around the free

42
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,479
software legal tools if you want you can

43
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,840
tweet at me or you can email me I'll do

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,659
that again at the end so I see this as

45
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,670
sort of a two-part challenge first the

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,829
way that we think about copyrights and

47
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,350
patents is actually different it really

48
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,440
is different when you go out into the

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,170
rest of the world poverty rates are

50
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,690
pretty old so a lot of our stuff around

51
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,610
especially copyright but also patents is

52
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,069
based

53
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,140
legal code from property rights in the

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,260
u.s. you can shoot someone you like for

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,299
trespassing on your property so like

56
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,790
think of all that is being baked into

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,739
light what are you doing with my things

58
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,200
and that's like baked into our legal

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,540
code in the western parts of the world

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,689
where we you know well I know you guys

61
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,989
don't shoot people over here but not

62
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,849
usually that's you that's kind of our

63
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,250
Chairman I guess so

64
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,129
copyright is is old enough it's you know

65
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,290
we started using copyright as an

66
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,900
international thing in 1886 when the

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,959
Berne Convention was established and and

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,790
that means there's a lot of there's a

69
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,769
lot of case law in there that really

70
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,389
like holds this idea that the written

71
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,150
words should be considered you know of a

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,090
piece with cattle and land and

73
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,189
pitchforks and all those kinds of things

74
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,370
so so we're really going upstream when

75
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,470
we were like cool borrow my cows

76
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,189
whatever so it's that's that's one of

77
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,900
our challenges and messaging the way

78
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,720
that we talk about our tools another

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,699
thing that kind of goes with that is

80
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,709
that lawyers tend not to be early

81
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,519
adopters present company expected but

82
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,190
usually if it's like oh I didn't learn

83
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,069
about that at all in law school cool

84
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,500
I'll try it out on my first legal job

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,260
and see if I get fired that's not

86
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
usually an animal for like a successful

87
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,430
lawyer and finally do you guys know what

88
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,859
this is from Hitchhiker's Guide to the

89
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,500
galaxy it's a a note about we're going

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,209
to destroy your house that's being kept

91
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,949
in the basement of a municipal building

92
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,870
that's open on the third Thursday of

93
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,540
every month so a lot of our

94
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,680
documentation tends to be like this it's

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,650
not like we haven't done a great job of

96
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,319
telling Liars that are not already here

97
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,130
in this room where to look for best

98
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,899
practices and things like that once

99
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,668
you're already in you get invited to the

100
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,560
secret cabal and all that kind of stuff

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
and that's great but before you're in

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,150
you don't know where to look so

103
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,210
the second part of our challenge is that

104
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,720
if we leave a vacuum for how we want

105
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,370
free software legal tools to be

106
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,250
perceived other parties will do our job

107
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,250
for us and they will do it poorly like

108
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,840
really poorly stunningly poorly boring

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,600
occasionally on maliciously so we'll

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,240
look at a couple of those entities that

111
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,050
have sort of stepped up so to speak so

112
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,020
oh you can't read this one very well the

113
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,940
compliance industrial complex we talked

114
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,650
about this last week and or two weeks

115
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,490
ago in Australia and and talked about it

116
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,250
before their mantra is be afraid be very

117
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,570
very afraid of copyleft and all of that

118
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,400
free software that you're getting out on

119
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,389
street corners and whatever they the

120
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,460
reason is is that they they want you to

121
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,919
pay them to make all the scary stuff go

122
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,010
away this is not so different than if

123
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,600
you look at those advertisings in the

124
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,090
50s for you know stuff to make all the

125
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,919
different parts of your body smell good

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,870
and they were really like fear-based

127
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,910
they were like oh why doesn't no one

128
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,380
like you at work it's because you're not

129
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,700
using this kind of stuff and so it's a

130
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,700
very old way of getting people to buy

131
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,370
your product so you see this also

132
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,440
sometimes this kind of attitude from

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,229
people who are vying for an inside

134
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,870
council job so they want to say like oh

135
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,270
there's this huge danger over here but

136
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,180
luckily I am an expert in the domain and

137
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,900
I can fix it for you so this makes this

138
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,270
makes them sort of against our message

139
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,220
which is that we're producing a bunch of

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,680
scary gotcha

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,490
sort of software another thing

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,070
trial lawyers I read a couple of these

143
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,349
like trial lawyer blogs if you guys are

144
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,690
not familiar this is the rokoko

145
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,150
art period which is like you can see

146
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,919
there's like ruffles on the ruffles and

147
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,650
flowers on the flowers it's a very like

148
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,930
you know there is no such thing as too

149
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,199
much and that is kind of the trial

150
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,180
lawyer mantra in these days when we're

151
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,159
discussing the scope of patentability

152
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,529
how long

153
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,869
copyright be good for and their answer

154
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,389
is there is no such thing as too much

155
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,789
like you know the earth could be a

156
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,519
cinder after the Sun has gone away and

157
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,529
we should have copyright go on for

158
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,069
another 70 years right I don't know who

159
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,609
that's for but that would be that would

160
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,879
be their their position so this is the

161
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,639
maximalist scope ends up producing some

162
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,939
pretty ridiculous kinds of results which

163
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,219
we'll talk about in a minute and then if

164
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,199
I only venture capitalists this is

165
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,089
Ursula from The Little Mermaid she

166
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,569
talked to REO and made it seem like you

167
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:25,389
know like oh I care for you I want you

168
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,599
to realize your dreams that's actually

169
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,249
not what happened in case you didn't see

170
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,089
the Little Mermaid she she was very much

171
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,829
in her own self-interest and venture

172
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,239
capitalists are doing the same thing

173
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,479
they convince young startups you should

174
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,309
get lots and lots and lots of patents

175
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:45,610
not because it's gonna be so great for

176
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,559
you to spend all that money on patents

177
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,259
or whatever but when your dream is dead

178
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,749
I can at least sell off the patents and

179
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:54,669
so this is another place where people

180
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,529
are getting like patents are super super

181
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,299
important they're like what they should

182
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:01,419
be hearing there is I mostly expect your

183
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,939
thing to fail and I hope to sell off the

184
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,419
furniture and the patents so this is not

185
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,279
a good place for people to be getting

186
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,349
information about how legal tools work

187
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,829
and how they interact with software Oh

188
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,909
random people in it I get through the

189
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:21,159
fish sorry about that so this isn't I'm

190
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,369
not sure why but people listen to random

191
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,599
folks on the internet I used to

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,219
underestimate this group until the last

193
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,500
election but not anymore and apparently

194
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,169
they have opinions also about copyleft

195
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,029
free software legal tools what the scope

196
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,698
of patentability should be if you want

197
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,789
to if you want lower your IQ any day go

198
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,160
looking for people talking about will

199
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,269
you know that legal tools on slash got

200
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,779
lots of lots of stuff there I used to

201
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,309
own I used to work at the FSF like

202
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:55,340
people would call me up

203
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,890
try and get me to give them legal advice

204
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,650
over the phone people it's it's kind of

205
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,110
it's weird it's like they think like

206
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,940
legal advice is some street drug if you

207
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,530
could just trick people into giving it

208
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,360
to you you don't have to pay as much for

209
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,290
it it's not like that and then finally

210
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,940
there are other kinds of opportunists

211
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,450
there are companies that think they see

212
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,700
an angle here they're like they come to

213
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,650
our community and they're like oh look

214
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,660
at all these little kids making software

215
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,660
with their hippie-dippie licenses and

216
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,010
they think they're just gonna like roll

217
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,440
up and take it and go away and there

218
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,400
won't be any consequences so this you

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,320
know obviously there are still rules so

220
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,330
now that we're convinced that we need to

221
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,940
craft our own message and not let random

222
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,320
people on the internet and other bad

223
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,220
actors do it for us how do we do that so

224
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,370
it's creative two parts one we need to

225
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,070
be able to convey the facts properly and

226
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,910
then two we also need to be able to

227
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,390
convey what is good behavior and what is

228
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,750
bad behavior here is where we are right

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,500
now this is a this is a church in a

230
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,360
man-made lake

231
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,340
they definitely removed the bells but

232
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,870
that tells people we'll all tell you

233
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,480
that they hear them on spooky nights and

234
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,820
things like that and there's a lot going

235
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,800
on below the surface so a lot of people

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,990
who come to our shores

237
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,450
here in free software have seen this

238
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,340
they have no idea what's going on below

239
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,470
the surface it's up to us to fill that

240
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,710
in and for many folks mo Hobson free

241
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,710
software are brand new but they're not

242
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,270
new to everyone

243
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,800
so I feel like this critical piece of

244
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,630
context is something that we can provide

245
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,750
just because you've only just read about

246
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,270
the GPL doesn't mean that it is brand

247
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,920
new obviously everyone in this room

248
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,880
knows that but there are definitely more

249
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,730
traditional companies that you know

250
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,670
actually kind of new to software and are

251
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,949
new to our things and so you know when

252
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,360
they come here they're like oh I heard

253
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,940
about this new license and it's like hmm

254
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,769
yeah the chief show is not actually new

255
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,279
free software is 30 years old or so you

256
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,380
know it's I think it behooves us to

257
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,660
provide that context that like one it's

258
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,130
been around for a really long time and

259
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,440
then - it's probably not going anywhere

260
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,139
and so that I think will give it a

261
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,120
different gravity than like tell me

262
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,620
about this newfangled free software

263
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,709
thing and so I think it's it behooves us

264
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,760
to provide that context and then you

265
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,060
guys know what printer this is okay why

266
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,110
it is it is so the second thing I think

267
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,300
about crafting our message is that we

268
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,149
want to tell stories this is the printer

269
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,839
that RMS writes about in free software

270
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,149
free society in case you were wondering

271
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,430
what it looked like it's big right you

272
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,680
could probably fit like a family of four

273
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,500
in there but I'm kind of another

274
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,660
printers like that anymore but he made

275
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,779
us you know he told a story about a

276
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,370
printer that captured people's

277
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,769
imagination so when I tell you that we

278
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,510
can craft a story that makes free

279
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,720
software interesting I think we can do

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
it right

281
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,870
printers are not inherently interesting

282
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,810
right I mean maybe if you work at HP I

283
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,889
don't know but so one thing that I would

284
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,019
say is that part of that story has to be

285
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,380
that so we've got happy right but a lot

286
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,899
of different entities have added to an

287
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,810
embroidered upon the idea of copyright

288
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,060
with different kinds of legal tools and

289
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,639
I think it's interesting to think about

290
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,380
what the motive for those different

291
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,800
types of additions to copyright are so

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,760
like the DMCA the goal here is actually

293
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,269
not to like help the world or give stuff

294
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,970
away or be a nice person it's kind of to

295
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,459
force people to give you money for stuff

296
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,500
that they didn't use to have to give you

297
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,499
money for you know

298
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,509
I could do a whole talk on how I feel

299
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,549
like we're hurtling towards the

300
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,499
situation where people are obligated to

301
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:18,039
buy stuff you know but that's that is

302
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,039
actually a whole other talk so so this

303
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,939
is like ads this is an attempt to update

304
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:27,069
copyright but it's I don't think that

305
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,879
it's for for a good reason it's you know

306
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,729
it's for commercial interests to the to

307
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,859
the consumers detriment if we could

308
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,329
balance that it would be okay I'm not

309
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,669
opposed to people making money like you

310
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,529
know I like a big platter of sushi as

311
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,749
much as the next person who likes a big

312
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,959
platter of sushi I guess but this you

313
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,619
see where commercial interests are being

314
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:54,069
balanced against free speech and so this

315
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,869
is another place where we've tried to

316
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,009
like how do we update copyright this is

317
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,149
essential is from the blender foundation

318
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,669
it's like a completely free software

319
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:06,189
open source like everything is is

320
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:09,129
license Creative Commons and it tweaks

321
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,169
something for Sony Pictures and they

322
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,869
sent automatic takedown notice whoops

323
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,299
but I think this is really telling about

324
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,959
like overreach and how how that

325
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,629
overreach can be really ridiculous so

326
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,899
you know so we can we can talk about the

327
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,279
way that we interact ways that we

328
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,379
interact with copyright that feel wrong

329
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:34,749
ways to feel ridiculous and and talk

330
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,259
about like what we might do instead Cory

331
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,179
Doctorow likes to talk about copyleft as

332
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,089
the software licensing equivalent of not

333
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,429
buying cookies at the store so that

334
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,439
later when you're really hungry and you

335
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,999
want to eat all the cookies you've

336
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,609
already behaved yourself to the

337
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,619
community and said we're all going to

338
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,599
act in the communities interests as

339
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:59,109
opposed to you know sell it off at the

340
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:00,849
exclusion of the rest of the group if

341
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,239
that if that makes sense maybe you don't

342
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,409
crave cookies in the middle of the night

343
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:12,249
but so patents again we can we can make

344
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,769
it look ridiculous Apple has a design

345
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,659
patent on rounded corners this is a

346
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,580
tablet an actual tablet

347
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,230
well from the Assyrian Empire so like

348
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,180
the idea that they were trying to have a

349
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,920
patent on that is ridiculous and they

350
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,150
should be mocked this is fog which I

351
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,130
couldn't figure out how to picture are

352
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,480
some of the really vaguely written

353
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,950
patents but I think it's important to

354
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,990
talk about how ridiculous they are in

355
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,090
mock things like the file allocation

356
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,350
table patent or there's a patent on the

357
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,480
did you mean to attach a file to email

358
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,970
when you have forgotten you know and it

359
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,470
has the word attachment in it I don't

360
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,640
know if that was granted but it was

361
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,250
definitely applied for and then so silly

362
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,260
ridiculous and then this one is actually

363
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,820
just evil this is not a patent as a

364
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,350
copier but there was a company troll

365
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,580
that sued nonprofit in Vermont for image

366
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,350
processing patents and they wanted money

367
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,780
from everyone who used their copier

368
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,110
there are nonprofit that serves like

369
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,610
unemployed people who want to make

370
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,470
copies of their resume they would have

371
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,030
sunk them to pay a thousand dollars a

372
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,790
pop so when we talk about like why we

373
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,280
are really passionate about these legal

374
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,860
tools it's because we want to stop evil

375
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,540
we want to get rid of the silliness we

376
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,010
want to get rid of the ridiculous and

377
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,250
frivolous patents so sharing in a patent

378
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,910
world we've written patent clauses like

379
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,260
I said I work at the open invention

380
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,780
Network the DPL lot these are all to

381
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,880
enable sharing and I think that's the

382
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,100
story that we want to tell so again

383
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,720
organizing people where they're at you

384
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,090
want to understand that not everybody

385
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,790
knows everything only not even Bradley

386
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,320
Kuhn left the womb knowing about

387
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,930
copyleft right so you have to ask

388
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,640
questions to figure out where people are

389
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,459
at they might be concerned about

390
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,920
security many eyes may shower bugs it's

391
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,730
a great argument maybe promoting their

392
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,459
company being a good actor in our space

393
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,530
and not coming late to the party and

394
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,290
screwing it up is a great way to put

395
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,480
your company out there and then

396
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,339
efficiency having clear ass assignation

397
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,230
policy so like people know how to give

398
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,900
you their code is going to be good

399
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,030
so sharing our code I think it's also

400
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,280
important for us to talk about when you

401
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,530
have crossed the line what is not okay

402
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,570
free software is more like bowling than

403
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,230
mom if you think you're a disrupter like

404
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,150
because you've come here to like with us

405
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,880
clever hack to steal code or whatever

406
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,150
you're not and and we need to say that

407
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,770
that needs to be part of our message I

408
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,330
think you don't have to use these words

409
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,970
you can use your own voice I understand

410
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,200
not everyone wants their cousin win a

411
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,110
jerk last dates don't make friends and

412
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,270
people remember so if your company is

413
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,610
like cool I found all these like kids

414
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,530
making software with this hippie license

415
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,750
and then you sue everyone for short term

416
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,410
game

417
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,150
guess what they're not going to want to

418
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,030
come work at your company if you want

419
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,100
more on how to not show up as a

420
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,430
disruptor jerk Vicki Mercer has a great

421
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:28,130
talk on this so in conclusion our

422
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,620
messaging is here in the murky water II

423
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,390
depths right now and I want to see us

424
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,260
come into the light and you know have

425
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,390
people see us working have us haven't

426
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,830
seen what we're doing have us explain

427
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,320
why we're doing it you know get them to

428
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,180
come along with us take them fishing

429
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,870
maybe I don't know if you one solid

430
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,910
piece that you could come and help us as

431
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,170
far as like creating better

432
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,870
documentation is to work on the beyond

433
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,520
licensing working group at the open

434
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,280
source initiative I have picture credits

435
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,650
of course and then I would be happy to

436
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,030
take whatever questions we have time

437
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,530
[Applause]

438
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:19,790
are there any questions any other day

439
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,260
it's totally fine if we don't have

440
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,170
questions where people can send me I

441
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,600
know sometimes with legal topic sick you

442
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,210
know what I'd be like my friends company

443
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,980
like it's fine you can contact me

444
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,940
directly as well oh I feel like I have

445
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,590
to come up with a question okay it's a

446
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,760
question how would you compare the

447
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,690
different patent groups like Oh Ann and

448
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,240
llt and DPL I don't know much about DPL

449
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,070
maybe did you say worried about those

450
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,090
yeah so the open invention network is a

451
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,380
defensive patent pool everyone signs an

452
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,970
agreement not to sue each other within

453
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,370
the pool and it's focused on Linux can

454
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,860
you Android and that kind of stuff

455
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,140
the license on transferring network is

456
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,020
intended to make it unappealing to sell

457
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,990
patents to a troll which is defined by a

458
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,090
company that gets more 50 percent or

459
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,430
more of their revenue from patent

460
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,300
aggression and so that's that's an

461
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,010
additional contract that follows that

462
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,200
pattern around and then the DPL is the

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,670
defensive patent license which doesn't

464
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,100
have a lot of uptake but I know they're

465
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,470
still tinkering with it it's intended to

466
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,680
kind of mirror the GPO but be for lives

467
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,140
and like for licensing patents so

468
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:40,799
so that was quite entertaining but the

469
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,690
point was that you you suggesting that

470
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,129
we don't make that message very well but

471
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,570
surely that's what you said is exactly

472
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,669
what any of us would say and is that not

473
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,950
already the message people give I mean

474
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,389
maybe it's not received anywhere cuz

475
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:53,070
some people have just turned up but I

476
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,599
don't see a lot of people even not

477
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,249
giving those sensible messages I think

478
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:57,859
it's more than it needs to be

479
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,929
intentional and I think that when were

480
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,049
called upon to do it we probably do a

481
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:07,200
good job but that maybe we're like oh

482
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,239
just use the software and then if we

483
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:11,129
could take another minute I'm saying we

484
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:15,450
should be more proactive yeah so that's

485
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,190
that's that's kind of what I would like

486
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,580
to see us do right or you could join me

487
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,679
on the be on licensing work group so we

488
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,450
could document some of this stuff and

489
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,339
then then instead of doing it over and

490
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,690
over again you could just point people
