1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,980
so our next speaker will speak about her

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,940
privacy

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,969
it's a daddy Marcus and it will explain

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,580
you privacy pretty easy let's upload him

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,920
it's more like pretty easy privacy but

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,850
that's fine

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,880
so I am a council member of pepper

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,810
Foundation and non-commercial entity

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,739
first of all who knows Papp here cannot

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,239
so many people so that's the right top

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,890
because it's not very technical if you

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,899
want to have more technical information

13
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:45,190
we have a stand with Agnew taller in the

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,339
K building I am also not developing at

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,929
the engine level of stuff like that so

16
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,239
don't come up with C questions and why

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,339
these crashes and stuff like that for

18
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:57,489
awesome for at me so first of all

19
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,129
yeah that's PAP we're pretty easy

20
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,199
privacy with an emphasis on the e

21
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,809
because we have already good privacy you

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,229
know but it's not really easy at least

23
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,240
it's our experience with doing crypto

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,430
parties and and stuff so people in the

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,320
end are not really able to use it at

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,820
least not the regular users first of all

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,060
what what PAP is not so PAP is not yet

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,030
another crypto tool with a closed user

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,689
base like encrypted mail services which

30
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,210
are around or certain apps which have a

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,640
clear identifiers like phone numbers and

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,100
stuff so PAP doesn't improve and pose

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,170
you a certain identifier you can freely

34
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,060
choose depending on the communication

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,039
channel use for email of course it's her

36
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,049
email address that usually can choose

37
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,570
freely so we are also not a platform

38
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,369
provider so we don't have any metadata

39
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,619
so it's just about tools on the end-user

40
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,280
devices we are also not a crypto project

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,049
we are just using crypto already there

42
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,700
we are also not replacing the tools

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,259
already they were just using them and

44
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,560
making them easier to use and we just

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,410
start with email but that's that's not

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,508
the end it's it's it's just the

47
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,870
beginning so and then probably a

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,180
positive list what are we doing actually

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,349
first of all it's kind we kind of

50
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,969
abstract already existing crypt tools

51
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,849
like new PG or for iOS or flyover

52
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,890
because of licensing we have to use the

53
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,629
net PGP because it's a little bit broken

54
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,340
or it was a little bit broken we have we

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,769
forked it and continued to a little bit

56
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,230
development on it and for author

57
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,510
protocol for other crypto standards of

58
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,099
course you will need other libraries but

59
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,189
yeah they are already there it's

60
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,409
designed I said for for starting with

61
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,260
email but then we will add more crypto

62
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,139
standards later on it's also built with

63
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,269
the idea that you have a unified mailbox

64
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,700
the idea is that you if you use signal

65
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,919
or what separate ever you usually use a

66
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,030
base you have there

67
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,459
but author users just have email

68
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,169
addresses or use completely something

69
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,969
different like three more or whatever

70
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:10,400
and the idea of PAP is to bring this all

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,709
together in one place by supporting all

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,150
the involved crypto standards so you

73
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,919
have one box with all your contacts and

74
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,650
that the most secure way to communicate

75
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,250
with them will be used by default and

76
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,989
this encryption stuff will be done

77
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,479
automatically so keys are generated

78
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,310
automatically for every address you have

79
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,280
you have several mail addresses for each

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,769
mail address a key pair is created and

81
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,139
yeah and then you can just start to

82
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,849
encrypt without that user has to do

83
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,620
anything so it's zero touch and

84
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,530
hassle-free no dialogues talking about

85
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,689
real vocation certificates about private

86
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,340
key stuff like that so we also avoid

87
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,519
these terms for the end user but of

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,079
course if you are a power user what most

89
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,060
of you will be you can also go into

90
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,949
advanced settings and use the things

91
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,509
already there and if you already use

92
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,090
open PGP I don't have to tell you how to

93
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,340
use it so it's already finally I can

94
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,319
communicate already with you but we also

95
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,349
have to think about the normal people

96
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,379
which are really not able to use this

97
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,139
kind of stuff so why are we doing this a

98
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,000
little bit of motivation I think we have

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,949
a global problem first of all so there's

100
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:19,009
the NSA surveillance complex if if you

101
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,259
look at if you look if you look at it

102
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,120
globally so we have really big issues

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,050
that are sort of China or Russia

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,479
whatever doing mass surveillance and if

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,370
you are a little bit more narrow in your

106
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,130
thinking like the Swiss tend to

107
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,560
we also have mass surveillance this kind

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
of things here is onyx mass surveillance

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,010
interception system for satellite based

110
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,840
communications it was passed in

111
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,940
Parliament as a multi proposed building

112
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,390
for 20 or 40 million francs so without

113
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,600
any legal basis and afterwards it

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,360
created the legal basis so that so the

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,820
Swiss are you Switzerland it's a nice

116
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,320
democracy but there are also strange

117
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,570
things going on by the way they started

118
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,250
to build this after ash alone was

119
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,970
revealed so your interesting interesting

120
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,190
approach instead of of stopping this

121
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,660
kind of stuff they just said oh let's

122
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,670
build our own stuff yeah if you look it

123
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,070
at an email context let's say you have

124
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,310
your original NSA slides as leaked by

125
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,950
Edward Snowden showing how mass

126
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,930
surveillance on let's say linguistic

127
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,910
basis is done so you with you if you are

128
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,880
I mean a CBS advanced conventional

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
weapons or VM days weapons of mass

130
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,010
destruction golf torques is the dets

131
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,510
attack for government organization so

132
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,840
you can you can you can search in emails

133
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,760
with topics there are lots of methods of

134
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,620
text mining machine learning to do that

135
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,330
kind of stuff and we should just encrypt

136
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,860
everything so this stuff cannot be done

137
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,010
anymore also if you look at a little bit

138
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,960
more general so for written digital

139
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,310
communications what we are doing I mean

140
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,290
PAP is about encrypting text not not

141
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,930
voice yet so if you look at it in this

142
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,510
more general sense yeah you see that

143
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,670
they just scan everything like HTTP

144
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,950
request calendar bodies archives

145
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,800
document bodies chat bodies email bodies

146
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
so this stuff we just have to encrypt

147
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,500
everything so this stops

148
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,990
how does PAP I said we start with email

149
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,460
so how does we differ from open PGP

150
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,320
because there is already open PGP or

151
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,190
implementations around RFC for 880 so

152
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,090
PAP doesn't use doesn't use key service

153
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,770
by default because the social graph is

154
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,910
disclosed

155
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,250
either by queries or if you sign around

156
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,340
and upload your your public key signed

157
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,300
everyone can see with whom you

158
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,650
communicate of course you can do key

159
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,140
signing parties and and try to to

160
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,540
dissipate a little bit stuff but still

161
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,010
it's a little bit problem also you have

162
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,849
a key or a encryption problem a problem

163
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,860
by the way which all this platform

164
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,889
centric solutions have like what's up so

165
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,629
you don't really know with whom you're

166
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,080
communicating as long as you didn't

167
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,550
check the identity with fingerprints or

168
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,279
whatever the sender's public key is

169
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,929
attached by default to to add to any

170
00:06:57,929 --> 00:06:59,759
email you can also switch this off in

171
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,229
certain contexts or in companies

172
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,119
organizations if it's if it doesn't make

173
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:03,719
any sense

174
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,719
but yeah for the for regular users it's

175
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,110
like this the subject field gets put

176
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,749
into the into the body and then mapped

177
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,669
by the by the male user agent into the

178
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,830
real body so graphically it looks like a

179
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,459
real subject but but it's it's in the

180
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,979
body in fact instead of fingerprints we

181
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,929
use trust words are just mappings to

182
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,879
natural language words like English

183
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,599
German whatever and this is this we do

184
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,279
because we don't believe that people are

185
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,409
able to compare a hex finger

186
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,709
fingerprints very efficiently especially

187
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,749
if you take into consideration that you

188
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,189
can do that you should do that

189
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,229
why a site channel like phone or

190
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,110
something so we just use your trust

191
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,459
words that I think there are from

192
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,360
LibreOffice with real words removed by

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,899
native language speakers Peppa's also

194
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:57,709
rating systems we rate how secure

195
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:01,379
communication is on a user basis or in a

196
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,019
message level basis and this is shown

197
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,659
with traffic light semantics that means

198
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,189
with colors I will show an example

199
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,569
afterwards so for example s/mime with

200
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,999
commercial CAS we consider as not secure

201
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,079
so we won't show that encrypted

202
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,069
plaintext message of course also not

203
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,209
secure but PGP would say is secure and

204
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,240
author sentence of course - so here is a

205
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,189
outlook example that's paid for Outlook

206
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,068
that the source code is exists so you

207
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,389
can also compile it yourself and check

208
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:33,990
if you want

209
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,719
there there also author projects for iOS

210
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,370
for Android for any main so if you if

211
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,670
you write you your your first email or

212
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,790
usually you don't have the public key of

213
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,920
the contact so down here it's shown

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,529
unsecure then you just write your your

215
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,480
plaintext message of pop public key is

216
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,370
attached

217
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,160
receive an answer from your from your

218
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,680
former body then probably you can import

219
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,620
also his public key and as of then the

220
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,570
communication is shown secure but then

221
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,250
of course you still have to mitigate for

222
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,140
the man in the middle attack for that

223
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,270
you can do these trust words comparison

224
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,790
there you see you can just call him and

225
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,089
ask if if the same trust words are shown

226
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,480
on both devices for that for that to

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,100
work with common trust words you of

228
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,779
course you need to put the fingerprints

229
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:29,260
together and and map them to towards I

230
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,260
can afterwards I can I can bring details

231
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,730
at the stand for exam because we think

232
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,880
time is running away when you when you

233
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,070
did that so when you contact was

234
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,440
verified it shown secure and trusted so

235
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,660
you can be quite sure there is no man in

236
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,040
the middle attack possible anymore if

237
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,450
something happens if someone is

238
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,220
tampering around with your with your

239
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,140
communication channel then it will turn

240
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,850
red and then it's written under attack

241
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,650
so you can you can you can still

242
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,029
communicate that's the most important

243
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,980
thing in pep people are never never

244
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,690
stopped from from communicating but you

245
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,459
at least should know that something is

246
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,120
possibly wrong so what is coming next we

247
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
are we are working on fixing hissing

248
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,670
hissing is it's a bit is a protocol to

249
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,520
transfer private key material through

250
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,709
your different devices where the common

251
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,150
identifier is for example or email

252
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,790
address for that to be secure you need

253
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,060
of course or trusted at least you trust

254
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,390
an insecure sorry you need you need to

255
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,830
make your channel green so you need to

256
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,810
check again your trust words on both of

257
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,000
your devices and then you need to agree

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,920
on on a key to use for the future so

259
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,860
we're that's cloudless

260
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,680
platform-independent key synchronization

261
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,010
protocol we will also add more

262
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,270
transports here with other crypto and

263
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,970
blue net in in with will also be added

264
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,790
in 2.0 monitors completely erratic 'el

265
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,700
they want to just replace the whole

266
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,320
internet stack so no fee should new

267
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,529
project and yeah synchronization of

268
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,330
fourth data can be done like calendar

269
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,600
and contact data and we of course we are

270
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,579
community focused here we want us to

271
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,370
make this an Internet standard so we

272
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,310
drafting internet drafts for ITF and

273
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,080
yeah politically we also want to fight

274
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,340
mass surveillance

275
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,190
so we also we are really political so we

276
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,510
are not just doing techniques here for

277
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,450
the some no to the foundation which I'm

278
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,370
representing here the foundation Swiss

279
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,560
based tax free non-commercial and the

280
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,890
controlled by by by by by radicals in

281
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,530
the area of digital rights so there

282
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,630
there's no compromising here so we have

283
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,370
to replace us if you want to change our

284
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,910
what we are doing what we're doing here

285
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,990
the foundation holds ownership on the

286
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,120
core technology on the GPL foundry and

287
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,740
those are the trademarks this is to make

288
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,590
sure that no one that people don't

289
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,990
really software called quit easy privacy

290
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,720
which is back a tort also to avoid

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,020
backdoors we require everyone who calls

292
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,510
their stuff kept pretty easy privacy to

293
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,640
to to run a code out it but we don't

294
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,610
force them to open the source code so

295
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,080
it's just someone has to independently

296
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,700
look if there are no backdoors I mean

297
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,140
what's that for example it's also clear

298
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,540
what these two is doing in the end and

299
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,640
we also do political very supported

300
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,320
referendums in Switzerland against mass

301
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,970
surveillance we felt a little bit around

302
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,020
but we will continue on other ways there

303
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,340
we also collaborate with certain

304
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,020
projects already like any men so any

305
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,730
male pepper will come out I think from

306
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,540
the bird 52 that's March April this year

307
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,760
if we manage to do everything we also

308
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,260
collaborate with can unite and with

309
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,790
Isaac Switzerland that's probably

310
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,040
interesting for internet standards and

311
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,110
we are open for more collaboration so

312
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,520
it's not about competitions about

313
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,830
collaboration here I think that's all

314
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,810
and we don't have time anymore probably

315
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,700
but you can come to the stand otherwise

316
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,829
[Music]

317
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,720
what do we have time I mean okay to life

318
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,630
yes he asked for HTML males with pap

319
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,690
what is done in purpose in the engine

320
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,240
there is something which converts HTML

321
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,210
to text and then you have a text file in

322
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,420
the attachment and the HTML file and the

323
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,310
subject line which we encrypt is in the

324
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,860
text so we can map it back again

325
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,690
enik mail had issues with that kind of

326
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,190
stuff where I was involved in this

327
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,170
discussions there so it actually works

328
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,450
but of course there will always be some

329
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,040
box in some us and stuff or they will

330
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,500
fix at all of this yeah
