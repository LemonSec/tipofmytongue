1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,050
so hello everybody

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,380
I'm going to present you a video game on

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,460
synthetic biology just to present myself

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,000
a mafia gooje I'm a computer science

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,820
engineer I've worked on commercial games

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,890
and then on scientific games and I am

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,610
doing a PhD on learning with video games

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,760
I come from the center for research and

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,750
interdisciplinary T like Jessie when we

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,660
are based in Paris the tower on the left

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,199
my palace tower I invite you to go to

12
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,570
the website creeper s dot org and

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,609
especially on the game lab page

14
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,070
it's a lab in which Jesse and I are

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,280
working we are working on any sort of

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
game that can be interested for

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,819
education and digital technologies so

18
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,159
our Center is specialized in education

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,909
digital technologies and life sciences

20
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:02,339
that's why it makes sense for me to work

21
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,830
on a videogame on biology educational

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
video game on synthetic biology I won't

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,909
make the same presentation as last

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,610
year's so if you want to know more about

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,670
the game itself and the thought process

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,579
to create such a game I invite you to to

27
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,610
to watch the video that is on last

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,509
year's website the main idea is that

29
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,740
video games are based on profit

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,880
problem-solving and therefore learning

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,840
okay it's not that I French it so you

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,329
have complex games like this it was too

33
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:39,719
fast

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,899
too bad for you and next one is a bit

35
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,189
more easy so you see that there is a

36
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,289
whole range of games and a whole whole

37
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:50,850
range of learning and in no words this

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,320
is something that I have taken from a

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
research paper it its focus is impress

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,380
eyes aspects precise features that video

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,109
games can enhance so motivation

42
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,390
interests retention collaboration and

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,409
problem solving

44
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,509
this transition going to be a bit

45
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,628
academic but my try not to bore you to

46
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,150
death

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,310
so yeah divert I move it should be the

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:23,709
only balance Academy thing alright so as

49
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,080
you saw when I prepare my stuff I'm

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,629
going to play in a 640 x 480 and it will

51
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,900
be awesome and I think it will resize

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,310
anyways yeah because because why would I

53
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,190
choose I it's awesome it's asking so as

54
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,079
you can see it's exactly the ratio I

55
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,920
wanted and but the version on the

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,629
internet that you can play right now is

57
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,430
the old one that that was presented last

58
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,709
year and this version is the next one

59
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,090
that will be online next month so what

60
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,510
we've changed since last year is the

61
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,959
tutorial aspect last year's version was

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,329
kind of discovered by yourself and

63
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,660
understand by yourself now it's it's

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,940
more juicy you see bubbles and it's cool

65
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,420
and the algae are waving like this it's

66
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,579
it's way more entertaining there's still

67
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,440
a nice scenario that we have not touched

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,319
and we have also introduced some

69
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,280
cutscenes because here I don't

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,900
understand I cannot move what the hell

71
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,910
I'm a bacterium and I cannot swim what's

72
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,859
going on and then there's another

73
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,889
bacterium that comes and as what is

74
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,410
called a horizontal transfer of genes so

75
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,810
it gives me a gene for me to be able to

76
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,079
move so you see I introduced a story but

77
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,090
at the same time I'm introducing a very

78
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,250
interesting notion of genetics and that

79
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,500
organisms can exchange DNA and then it's

80
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,660
it's a tutorial like you can see in very

81
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,090
annoying games like Zynga games etc but

82
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,889
it's very necessary just for the

83
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,870
beginning its it stops after a few

84
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,730
minutes so it shows me why I have to

85
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,620
click and what I should do and what's

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,230
going on so it go very quick if you want

87
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,769
to understand in a few weeks go to the

88
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,109
website and undo it yourself so it shows

89
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:15,010
me where

90
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,160
my genetic sequences that are active

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,668
right now so you have one which is

92
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,669
making my bacterium move I very quickly

93
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,360
show the interface is very complex just

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,000
stay here keep the room and I choose me

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,639
what is relevant here it shows me with

96
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,370
what I can interact because the tests

97
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,419
I've done with the previous version

98
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,470
showed that everybody rushed to play but

99
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,300
did not understand what was going so now

100
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,280
it's very guided I see what I have to

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,039
click so that I can move yay so now I'm

102
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,410
a bacterium is a flagellum I and I can

103
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,010
move like this

104
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,740
alright so later on in the game I want

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,270
to show you everything you you'll see by

106
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,669
yourself there are all the notions that

107
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,820
are showed to you for instance it shows

108
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,180
you that cells can divide so here I

109
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,280
divide and it gives me a checkpoint if I

110
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,560
die we'll go back here so if I even eyes

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,289
myself proof then I reappear here ok no

112
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,169
Timo effect thank God

113
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,449
then you have you can find all the DNA

114
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,080
sequences and I will stop the demo here

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,280
all right so let's go back to the

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,310
presentation

117
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,990
ok nice frog there was a plan B which

118
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,289
was trader but it has worked somehow so

119
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,220
you won't see it so what you've seen in

120
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,449
these few minutes of demo is that we've

121
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,180
tried to incorporate real game features

122
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,699
to make it entertaining so it's a real

123
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,710
game with challenges there is stealth

124
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,180
learning the idea that you're not taught

125
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,160
something is something that you absorb

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,750
from the game you know that there is a

127
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,760
reason don't transfer you know that

128
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,130
there is cell duplication but never have

129
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,280
I showed you a book with ok this is the

130
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,930
reasons are transfer this is cell

131
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,970
division then there is also staff

132
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,039
assessment it means that when you're

133
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,570
playing you're being evaluated but you

134
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,520
don't know that there is no cucm I mean

135
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,690
a multiple-choice question

136
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,880
so you don't feel like you're being

137
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,890
judged so you play and oh everything's

138
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,350
cool cetera you've seen tutorials we've

139
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,110
seen some feedbacks there is on-demand

140
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,420
science it means that you're not you

141
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,580
don't have to read a full chapter of

142
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,310
science and you can skip most tutorials

143
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,760
anyways there's a little Texas possible

144
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,930
and so on so what am I doing here

145
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,360
why am I at was done with my educational

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,770
video game is because it's an

147
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,460
open-source game the shop code code is

148
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,550
on github but it's unity so sorry

149
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,500
genetic sequences come from an online

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,450
registry which is the BioBricks

151
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,120
foundation so it's open registry it's

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,150
also open source analytics that's JC

153
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,370
Himmelstein here which sorry you're

154
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,470
eating open source analytics and there's

155
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,510
open data too so if you want to see how

156
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,730
the game is being used you can go on

157
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,610
read matrix that IOC the pure color

158
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,410
version you want and see how people play

159
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,350
so you can do your own science on it and

160
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,790
you can control that I don't extract

161
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,200
personal data too

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
and where does it all come from why why

163
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,220
are we doing this well Jesse and I have

164
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,789
written an article and published it on

165
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,400
open analytics and it comes from a whole

166
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,770
whole process first there were games I

167
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,870
don't have to present them to you I mean

168
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,949
there are games and educational games

169
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,539
there is a whole range like games in

170
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,970
which you learn nothing like the mobile

171
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,740
game I I showed in the first light and

172
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,720
games in which you learn almost

173
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
everything there is to know like a

174
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,849
couple space program on top then there

175
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,060
were there was proprietary user tracking

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,110
so it's when you incorporates a program

177
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,800
that extracts data from from user user

178
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,240
actions and for instance if you see if

179
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,340
you search for application in science

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,349
there was a coated blood outbreak in

181
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,539
World of Warcraft maybe you heard of it

182
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,460
but there was a huge epidemic and a lot

183
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,190
of people died and for players it was

184
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,349
kind of fun but kind of annoying for the

185
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,870
people but Ryan scientist it was pure

186
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,700
gold because it was the first instance

187
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,799
in which they could simulate what people

188
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,929
do during an epidemic but the thing is

189
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,240
that the user analytics were not

190
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,610
developed to study this so lots of data

191
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,200
have been lost actually and that's very

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,440
sad there is a paper that I said here

193
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,350
that talks about this problem I've put

194
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,850
that just to tell you I know that it's

195
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,920
not World of Warcraft is just to annoy

196
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,720
gamers it's also because in Warcraft 3

197
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,680
there is also used on oolitic s' there

198
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,089
was because I think it's not playable

199
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,120
anymore and a better net and you could

200
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,500
see what people were doing when they

201
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,209
were playing there were stats on which

202
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,029
heroes were being played so that's also

203
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,810
interesting it's also user tracking

204
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,920
and then up two games and up to

205
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,540
proprietary user tracking there was

206
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,210
crowdsourcing of science I hope you

207
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,480
heard about folded the game that's

208
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
presented here

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,360
who hasn't who has never heard about

210
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,900
money okay lots of people cool so it's a

211
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,570
game in which you take a protein and you

212
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,570
try to find the more stable position so

213
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,310
protein is a chain of amino acids and

214
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,320
amino acids are kind of magnets you know

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
and they attract each other at some

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
points and they repel each other at

217
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,590
others so you imagine a string of

218
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,070
magnets if you you are you just shake it

219
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,130
and it will it will reach a stable

220
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,260
position and in the game we try to do

221
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,690
that it's too complex to to solve using

222
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,460
a computer because it's a chain of three

223
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,230
hundred amino acids with standoff

224
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,940
magnets everywhere so it's impossible to

225
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,710
to solve the communitary all

226
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,620
possibilities are exponential so what

227
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,440
you want to do is to start from here try

228
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,140
to tweak it and find the stable position

229
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,060
which is kind of compact as you can see

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,690
so people try to rotate parts of it etc

231
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,140
so these kind of games was created by

232
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,970
the University of Washington in like

233
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,830
2008 to solve a problem about proteins

234
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,410
on HIV or something and a scientist were

235
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,080
stuck on this they had been stuck for 10

236
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,330
years they couldn't manage to understand

237
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,550
what was the shape of the protein but

238
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,930
gamers in a few weeks

239
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,110
solved the problem just using this so

240
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,120
the results were published in their in

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,150
the paper I showed here it's a it's in a

242
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,090
very serious journal Nature right but

243
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,910
you can see here players so it's the

244
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,530
first time that science and video games

245
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,150
were brought together

246
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,029
and from that it was demonstrated that

247
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,250
games can be useful for science so in

248
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,020
the next step I want to do that with

249
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,339
Hiro could i but I don't have time to

250
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:12,760
explain

251
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,820
maybe risk questions so then next step

252
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,320
what is it it's to users are tracking

253
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,520
for science it's a kind of logic logic

254
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,860
step so that's what your Cola is doing

255
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,440
we want to study how people learn so we

256
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,480
use a game we use user tracking and you

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,450
use that for science alright so inside

258
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,970
the game we try to put some tracking

259
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,350
tracking system and from that we can

260
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,870
plot how players are moving through the

261
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,900
game and we can plot what evens happen

262
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,029
where in the game so if I see that

263
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,670
people are stuck here I will understand

264
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,130
that they die a lot here Blackie's is

265
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,770
death here if they are stuck here it

266
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,690
means that maybe the notion that I try

267
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,970
to introduce is too complex so I have to

268
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,650
work on that and I know that it's hard

269
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,680
for people to learn this notion but of

270
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
course I can do way more science I mean

271
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,440
power here I can do a VCR vlogs on the

272
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,779
top left I can do graphs I can do by

273
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:17,730
chance I can do everything yeah

274
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,200
so I can I can do all of that then I

275
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,640
study what people understand what they

276
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,650
don't understand you think yeah this

277
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,430
kind of forms yeah it's like Andre was

278
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,720
presenting just before our pretest

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,089
post-test etc

280
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,599
so what's the next step next step okay

281
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,369
it's going to be a bit more meta so

282
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,459
please please don't collapse it now we

283
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,979
try to do crowdsourcing on user data for

284
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,589
science alright so now we take user data

285
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,439
that were gathered on top left here

286
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,269
under what people were doing on the on

287
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,329
the game and we give it to people for

288
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,309
them to analyze right so it's not just

289
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,649
scientists it can be in this case it's

290
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,579
therapeutic games so we ask patients

291
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,949
what they think about the user data

292
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,549
we've gathered on themselves okay

293
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:11,139
so they can say well the doctors have

294
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,209
given me some treatment but it's not

295
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,859
efficient I can prove it from the user

296
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:17,739
data on the other hand they can say it's

297
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,629
very efficient look I can prove it from

298
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,379
user data

299
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,139
I mean people using this game and this

300
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,079
protocol are more supple and they they

301
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,969
can move for a more easier alright so

302
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,699
then there is another next step towards

303
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:36,309
a bit more meta we want to automate the

304
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:38,439
process we want to make it possible for

305
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:41,999
everybody to gather user data and

306
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,909
provide it on the Internet as open data

307
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,659
so that's what Jesse as Jesse

308
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,939
Himmelstein has developed and it's a red

309
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,549
matrix and it's open source as you can

310
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,679
see you can walk it on github and it's

311
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,149
ready to deploy you to start to deploy

312
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,729
in our on server and then and then it

313
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,379
just works okay so just to wrap up of

314
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,269
what you've seen forth there were games

315
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,189
then they were user tracking

316
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:12,459
then there was crowdsourcing then there

317
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,449
was a user data for science

318
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,819
then crowdsourcing user data for science

319
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,519
and then automating the process alright

320
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,979
and actually I'm already done I was so

321
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:27,099
fast yeah so maybe I can play again the

322
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,620
game or

323
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,080
and I can I can show you more things and

324
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,270
then then we will go to questions all

325
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:40,530
right so like what I can show you is the

326
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,990
simulation parts that we've introduced

327
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,390
in the game

328
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,320
because it's been shown that it's it's

329
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,250
more efficient for a running game to to

330
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,930
use simulators okay it's resizing all

331
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,200
the time so you'll find since here I

332
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,970
have my little bacterium that can

333
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,580
approve I will give it something to move

334
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,850
so I create a genetic sequence it seems

335
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,600
complex because it is a sandbox that I'm

336
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
showing you it means that it's

337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,640
everything is available so of course in

338
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,440
the game you discover everything step by

339
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,640
step here is everything simultaneously

340
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,140
so here I'm searching for the sequence

341
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,690
which makes which creates a flagellum

342
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,870
now I have it my bacterium can move yes

343
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,700
I know I can divide and I can show you

344
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,400
something that's very useful for

345
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,020
geneticists it's a sequence that make

346
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,590
bacteria appear green bright green it's

347
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,940
a gene that's extracted from a jellyfish

348
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,610
that transformed blue right into green

349
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,690
light so here but TEM takes blue light

350
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,360
and makes green light with it and if you

351
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,150
if you think a bit you can create more

352
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,630
complex systems here it's just if there

353
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,310
is blue eyes then I create green light

354
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,210
and so genetic sequence is always active

355
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,790
but you can create toggle switches so

356
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,220
that like on/off buttons but are

357
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,440
triggered by some external event so you

358
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,420
can do that on a bacterium and say if

359
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,540
there is such molecule then the

360
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,600
bacterium will be in an on state and it

361
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,190
will be blocked in this state stuck in

362
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,730
this state and if another event happens

363
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,490
specific events then switch to the off

364
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,580
state what I will show you is an even

365
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,760
more complex system which is to make a

366
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,600
bacterium blink so if you put these four

367
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,270
DNA sequences

368
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,540
okay I first have to kind of kick

369
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,850
started then the back jam will be linked

370
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,640
and this is not faked it's is there is

371
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,620
no system that says if there are those

372
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,930
four sequences then it will be you know

373
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,880
there is a food simulator that computes

374
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,949
molecule concentration so that's what

375
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,199
you see on the right side molecules

376
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,959
medical concentrations and they interact

377
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,569
with DNA sequences and create these

378
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,839
complex systems and from that you can

379
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,880
imagine that you can integrate this game

380
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,589
as as a practical during a course in

381
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,520
genetics

382
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,100
instead of having chapter one to study

383
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,679
or exercise 1 through 12 to you for

384
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,990
tomorrow you can say oh I finished the

385
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,080
first level of hero coli or try to

386
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,240
create something that makes the

387
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,110
bacterium have a different amount of

388
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,679
flagella so here I'm create something

389
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
that makes the number of flagella

390
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,120
oscillate so I can do this we'll have a

391
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,960
bacterium that that has an oscillating

392
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,050
speed you see because it's creating

393
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,050
flagella they string it creating etc etc

394
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,620
so you can you can from that create

395
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:30,919
exercises for people yes

396
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,960
so the question is am I thinking about

397
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,149
supporting the game to a number of open

398
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,309
source engine the thing is that I don't

399
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,399
have much time when I'm on my PhD year

400
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:47,220
last year so I have to to make

401
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,200
experiments I don't have time but if

402
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
anybody is interested in porting it to

403
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,259
an open source game engine yes

404
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,360
definitely the source code is already

405
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,190
here the thing is that it's in c-sharp

406
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,070
and I don't think c-sharp is most

407
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,889
optimized language for that but why not

408
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:08,269
yes I'm completely open to their chance

409
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,809
anybody else

410
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:26,210
the genetic functions this the question

411
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,279
is are the concentration kind of

412
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,830
realistic they are kind of realistic

413
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,679
because yeah yeah I I solve differential

414
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,019
equations and I use DNA sequences that

415
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:45,409
are extracted from the internet from the

416
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,049
very foundation that I show you so if I

417
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,109
look at some bricks I can see that it

418
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:54,679
comes from any lab so the lab of Drew

419
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,619
endy or Jeff piece from Stanford

420
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:00,649
University and you see all all these

421
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:08,299
like wavelength and length in a base

422
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,919
pairs everything is extracted from the

423
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,649
internet it's real data but the

424
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:16,039
simulator is a bit simplified so it's

425
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,289
really stick to a certain point for

426
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,269
example there is no simulation of

427
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,889
glucose intake you know here there is

428
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,619
hundreds you have hundreds energy and it

429
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,749
will go to zero and if you put a lot of

430
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:33,320
genetic sequences is not completely

431
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,960
realistic there should be something that

432
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,340
computes metabolic pathways and stuff

433
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,119
but I've asked specialists and they told

434
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,029
me you know specialists like those who

435
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,609
created the whole cell simulator they

436
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,619
told me no it's it's you can't do that

437
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,139
in real time because you have to compute

438
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,519
like a thousand genes similar to

439
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,649
simultaneously and not yet

440
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,830
yes French and English but I'm searching

441
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,300
for translators so if you're interested

442
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,270
to put it in Dutch German I don't know

443
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,500
what have I done to facilitate the

444
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,490
translation not a lot

445
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,530
now I've just I've created a Google

446
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,550
spreadsheet so it's I'm really at the

447
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,350
face of thinking about making it

448
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,530
possible to translate it I have not

449
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,750
advertised the possibility of actions

450
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,440
taken you know there is no tool for

451
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,130
translation I know that there are open

452
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,630
open-source tools but I've not spent

453
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,040
time on this because on unity there are

454
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,700
tools to enable quick translations and I

455
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,220
didn't want to spend time on trying to

456
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,800
create a bridge between such a tool and

457
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,960
unity tools so I had to choose between

458
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,990
working on the simulator working on

459
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,800
gamification sort of and making good

460
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,790
translation system yeah there are unity

461
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,280
tools to do that here but they are not

462
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,790
open sauce

463
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,010
the question is are the pledge inserted

464
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,230
when there is a sequence or if there is

465
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,520
a mechanism on the level below that says

466
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,980
there should be a flagellum the thing

467
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,390
that's I compute a concentration of a

468
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,980
molecule that controls the growth of

469
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,270
flagella so it says if the concentration

470
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,400
is above this threshold then there is

471
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,530
one fragile on then two then three and

472
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,450
four but it's it was retitled to make it

473
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,730
possible to play this part is not really

474
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,190
sick at all because otherwise if I had

475
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,370
made it really realistic the bacterium

476
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,520
would would go in random directions and

477
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,260
it would have from them concentrations

478
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,080
of such molecule so it would be

479
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,600
unplayable and that's why also the the

480
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,560
bacterium has eyes you know some aspects

481
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,930
that are it's supposed to be a shaker I

482
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,370
II cry but equalize more like a rice

483
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,400
grain a grain of rice and it looks like

484
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,850
a tadpole like a small frog you know so

485
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,770
yeah we've met with net choices

486
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,340
No

487
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,820
another question

488
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,030
okay well thank you

489
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:06,149
[Applause]
