1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,780
okay so we're gonna switch from a very

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,570
small and device to much bigger device

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,490
with the octo I am the French I am

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,340
French

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,200
embedded unique developer a writer and

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,560
teacher and currently I am a CTO for a

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,710
company called small DCs it was open

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,470
wide before us now it's my pcs which

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,600
been embedded and connected systems so

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,660
we we I will talk about using York to in

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,980
or IOT Walda with the first use case

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,489
with the sensor based on your small

13
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:49,730
Raspberry Pi zero and the stuck on sugar

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,620
an example would be an example from

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,340
people from togusa

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,630
that's my GCS and using a Raspberry Pi

17
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,100
runny yolk too but just for a body alter

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,939
so yeah oh sorry

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,200
Facebook is everywhere so there are

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,780
several kinds of objects we talked a lot

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,390
about the basic basic objects such as

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,280
sensors with micro controls and

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,260
sometimes the software is very tall so

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,930
I'm lightweight such as a Kentucky where

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,130
we talk about riot

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,400
there is another operating system very

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,290
very famous and quite all which is

28
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,650
called Kentucky and the second class of

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,590
object is a it's a computer it's a kind

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,410
of computer with high speed CPU set N n

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,050
OS the charger Linux Tizen or on Android

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,820
though they are some example this one

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,240
it's I go to if it is famous all out of

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,270
friends it's a palette from all right

35
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,420
it's a sensor for the closet pants for

36
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,710
for the flower so I use it on my flowers

37
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,350
in Paris but all the flowers are dead no

38
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,810
not because of the sensor but because it

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,610
was very cold and the second class is is

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,680
it Tesla Motors car and they say the

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,090
Tesla Motors is a kaku

42
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,570
is a connected computer on wheels it's a

43
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,840
kind of connected object and this is an

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
example of of coffee machine I didn't

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,570
test because I don't like coffee but so

46
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,450
I'd like you up tonight it's it's run in

47
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,839
New York too

48
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't know if it is really useful to

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,470
react to on the coffee machine but it's

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,910
fine for the demonstration so I will

51
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,270
talk about Linux and IOT and well it's

52
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,100
not a universal always for so for the

53
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,440
IOT and for the embedded but them there

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,630
is a document called a IOT develop a

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,080
survey last year and the they say the

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
73% of IOT devices run Linux and the

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,590
second one was bare metal which is quite

58
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,130
amazing and the Shah was FreeRTOS and

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,330
the sixth the fourth was Kentucky so

60
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,630
it's all except the army Tories all for

61
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,170
us that's a good news and but when you

62
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,010
talk about Linux as low as don't forget

63
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,390
you you ever so it is a a bunch of

64
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,330
distributions and you can put Linux on

65
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,910
the web without using a distribution so

66
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,650
the distribution such as do be unable to

67
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,680
Exeter is fine for for developing but is

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,170
not fine for it is my opinion for

69
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,660
embedded system and for embedded system

70
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,810
you use build systems such as October

71
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,840
root of some kind of windspeed system

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,489
but so you have to and we lose our most

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,700
famous

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,350
so you know what is a Linux distribution

75
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,900
I hope so so it's it's big and so that

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,330
got so slow but it's it's quite bigger

77
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,110
and now there is another problem most

78
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,970
distribution such as the one to on

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,880
Debian they run on armor so it is it's

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,280
easy to take a wrong way so we have loss

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,270
of course to know by an embedded border

82
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,550
they put the two on the board or Debian

83
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,530
and they say well we change it in the

84
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,750
future as I never change it except when

85
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,430
there is a big problem to the chorus and

86
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,460
a good way for one of the good way in my

87
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,460
opinion from running Linux on embedded

88
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,160
and IOT is to use a real system so what

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,500
is a build system it's not a

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,510
distribution it's just a tool to to

91
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,350
create the distribution from the sources

92
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,670
and most of time it does not provide the

93
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:07,390
sources but only recipes and system you

94
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,850
have to be binary Fry's to be installed

95
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,100
on the target so bootloader or Linux

96
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,410
kernel etc etc and you can provide

97
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,810
additional information such as or

98
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,540
licensing issues or dependency graphs

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,990
etc so it smell it's much better for the

100
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,620
footprint for the boot time etc it's

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,620
quite the same is Android Android user a

102
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,620
bit systems but they provide sources so

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,820
it's a 40 40 gigabytes society's 40

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,830
gigabytes that the provides all sources

105
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,190
and they are their version of external

106
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,370
sources and specific build system which

107
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,310
is based on a script but it's open

108
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,880
source it's a or a USP

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
so the most famous built systems there

110
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,770
are doctors the first one is Yocto as a

111
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,230
student one in my opinion is built-ins

112
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,810
Assad is open wrt which is based on the

113
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,690
road and two major difference between

114
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,030
balut and open to be RIA the value of t

115
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,370
is the packaging support on the unopened

116
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,090
evaluatee

117
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,000
so open the value at which is famous for

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,580
photo for the route or for this route or

119
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,670
bat so it runs and so on and such some

120
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,460
device small device for IOT this is the

121
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,910
we are you it's an IOT device develop in

122
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,250
Paris but she's not very famous because

123
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,050
because in front we are not very good

124
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,320
for all for selling things so it's

125
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,400
famous inside Paris and it's it's a

126
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,940
quite it's quite a good device with

127
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,680
dependability lots of sensor and very

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,970
cheap but well not very famous so it it

129
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,030
was a project from microsleep see and

130
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,230
now it's a real project with quite

131
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,150
simple it's based on makefile it's based

132
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,570
on you make and you can't reduce not not

133
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,430
really or Linux distribution that only

134
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,950
live CD ephemera because there is no

135
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,340
packaging support you know you will be

136
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,580
wrote you get an image and you Pete you

137
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,230
put it on the target and you can change

138
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:23,410
anything so where the problem was what

139
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,590
the first project before Yocto it's a

140
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,250
composition framework it was started for

141
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,680
this device which which is quite old it

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,990
was the first as far as I know it was

143
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,830
the first

144
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,150
PDA for for running Linux and cute and

145
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,740
it's quite famous too

146
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,870
well there is a Linux distribution for a

147
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,970
device most of people's I want to

148
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,120
develop another one not for using it but

149
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,300
for the pleasure to develop another one

150
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,550
that what that was was because the

151
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,159
people there walking over an open source

152
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,659
but they develop the to Jewish and

153
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,300
embedded so open embedded is based on

154
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,870
recipes with specific tool called beat

155
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,560
back and all the components are based on

156
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,710
recipes from the award to the world

157
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,150
distribution and that's quite different

158
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,919
from from the our classes he does

159
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,319
configuration files you can inherit from

160
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,190
classes you can derive a recipe which is

161
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,029
very useful we'll speak about it and the

162
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,779
file are organized videos and packages

163
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,240
first it was I PK which I which is a

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,060
very small packaging system but now the

165
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,890
default so the packaging system is happy

166
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,100
n because it's rare that put some money

167
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,950
into your top projects or well and lots

168
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,410
of people use write that way that you

169
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,110
know in industry so so Yocto is you need

170
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,209
prefix for the metric system so it's

171
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,640
it's a very small distribution not

172
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,700
really the size but it's just smallest

173
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,370
contra fix so it was started started

174
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,500
seven years ago by the Linux Foundation

175
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,920
and in order to integrate all the

176
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,810
project flow around the pan embedded

177
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,450
because the documentation the current

178
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,670
documentation of the sub-project around

179
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,160
the pond openembedded was awful

180
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,140
there was nothing except to be done to

181
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,010
be done to be done so there are lots of

182
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,440
documentation so it's quite complicated

183
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,930
to use your to but now you have a very

184
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,329
good with documentation so and lots of

185
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,240
embedded the companies including other

186
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,779
lawmakers and device makers software

187
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,360
details there are members of the Yocto

188
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,600
project and there is a guy which is the

189
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,460
chief

190
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,100
of the project such as enforcer Linux

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,500
development and for us it's very

192
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,690
important as a as a service company it's

193
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,580
very important to New York to and for

194
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,980
the customer to because the most of

195
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,620
Linux BSP to do today if you buy a

196
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,839
module you have the Linux BSP's New York

197
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,420
to layer openembedded layer so if you

198
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,970
don't know your to are open embedded you

199
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,050
can build your system you can't build

200
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,640
your system so it's one this is a

201
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,959
classical workflow as the main

202
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,350
difference between between built and and

203
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,410
yocto openembedded is that you you

204
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,470
generalize the pkg the packages even if

205
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,270
you don't put the packages on the on the

206
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,850
board inside the system there are all

207
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,610
the packages so if you you just have to

208
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,680
add an option to put the packages on the

209
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,899
on the board it's quite interesting it's

210
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,040
system based on layers so you have the

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,150
this yeah you have the basic layers the

212
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,830
Correa's and the you've to layer and

213
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,260
then you can put your layers so

214
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,459
additional layers upon the previous

215
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,740
layers the first one is a BSP of course

216
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,470
if you don't want to run qmu your basic

217
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,680
PC and then you can add anything you

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,020
want and for example you we can you can

219
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,050
write you can add a iot layer you can

220
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,430
below or get from external sources so

221
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,940
some colder if you want to build a yoke

222
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,670
to distribution for our raspberry pi you

223
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,420
to first so first step is to clone the

224
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,520
right branch it was based on Cugat but

225
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,029
now it so there is a new version you

226
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,900
plunge the metals built by layer you

227
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,380
start to build directory you are the

228
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,990
layer with the script you set the

229
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,600
machine name you build the basic

230
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,570
distribution and then you generate

231
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:17,830
for the SD card it's quite simple when

232
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,610
you know how to do so the first use case

233
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,100
was the last sermon as we were

234
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,040
integrated with with a smile company in

235
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,310
smile company was involved in open

236
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,970
source but in very open source in web

237
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,580
server etc not embedded systems so that

238
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,090
was I wanted to get a demonstration so

239
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,490
something like that

240
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,350
sorry it's in it's in French

241
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,550
something in French I mean in English so

242
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,410
they have some some some demonstration

243
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,000
just like yeah and they need a sensor to

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,260
get some data so they called me to build

245
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,290
a demonstration in one day about one or

246
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,040
two days and it was a demonstration

247
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,320
based on always berry pie it was not

248
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,510
raspberry pi 0 at this time but for so

249
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,790
for the first time I bought already Phi

250
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,250
0 because it's very smart and with

251
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,340
percent so I square C temperature and

252
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,070
pressure sensor I got from from Adafruit

253
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,960
by the food that I don't know the name

254
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,010
yeah I left in front

255
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,520
Wi-Fi USB and we use the HTTP protocol

256
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,460
because it was very simple so that was

257
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:48,190
nice so my my I I decided to start from

258
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,010
the smaller distribution which is called

259
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,220
coinage mini-mall and to add the right

260
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,680
package because you can you can build a

261
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,080
very complicated distribution with lots

262
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,180
of packages but I would start with a

263
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,000
very very basic distribution and the

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,950
basic distribution without the packaging

265
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,370
system is about 15 megabytes it's not

266
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,760
very big for Linux system and then then

267
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,010
I added some some options package

268
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,680
management stand out or

269
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,990
recipes and new recipes for example to

270
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,019
control the sins oh and I put everything

271
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:31,300
in a meter IOT metal T layer with script

272
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,339
you up to layer on on your toe you have

273
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,529
a local dot Cove which is your local

274
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,019
configuration five to build on your on

275
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,079
your build directory that is it's only

276
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,000
for the test because you can add lots of

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,790
option on a local the truth but if you

278
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,949
give the distribution to another guy

279
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,259
should not do the same thing so you have

280
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,680
to to build a dedicated distribution at

281
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,229
the end which is called a RPI IOT image

282
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,680
the derivation was very interesting in

283
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
New York oh it is very interesting in

284
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
your toe so the principle is quite

285
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,290
simple you have one recipe which is that

286
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,889
BB where you define how to build the

287
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,220
component in a for example and you write

288
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,500
a new new recipe not a new recipe recipe

289
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,680
which is called to VBI pen in the nozzle

290
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,470
layer and in the second recipe you can

291
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,139
change at files change files etc but you

292
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,720
don't change the main the main part of

293
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,579
the recipe it's not that's that's the

294
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:45,550
best interest and so from for example

295
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,180
for the example we modify the network

296
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,990
configuration which changes one-liner

297
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:58,439
eth0 to the wlan0 is well very difficult

298
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:04,269
we add HTTP cell our light httpd we

299
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,779
activated i square c in the config file

300
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,069
of the raspberry pi and we add to draw

301
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:16,500
the eye to eye i square cedars module

302
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,770
so for example in the basic distribution

303
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,390
for the Raspberry Pi on these eight

304
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,820
units HFS started so we have just to

305
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,710
switch from at eth0 to wlan0 we had some

306
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,580
additional packages we imagined sell

307
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,420
happen for so iw exit 2 etcetera and we

308
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,250
update the network interface five four

309
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,670
w10 and we use a manually we start the

310
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,430
network configuration with with urban

311
00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:04,190
area WPF pass for us starting hi

312
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,200
scratchy for a sweet rice quite simple

313
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,140
is not activated by default so we are we

314
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,680
up to to modify the the configure the

315
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,720
configuration file which is config dot

316
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,609
txt and to two other function which is

317
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,349
executed after of the deployment fossa

318
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,750
so it's called you deploy happened and

319
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,070
to modify the the file and then we we

320
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,790
add the two Sforza rice classy and a our

321
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,100
modules because the basic distribution

322
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,879
this doesn't include some illusion

323
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,530
you look like you snake you're grinning

324
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:53,170
and then you you you modify the kernel

325
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,310
you modify the kernel recipe just to add

326
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,150
this liner to activate the automatic

327
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,150
loader for I I square cedar and you have

328
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,050
to write control room the basic C

329
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,590
program there was a basic C program from

330
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,720
from the internet it was based on

331
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,500
writing tried for impiety library for

332
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,070
for pi players and it was a it was

333
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,420
packaged in the metals very pile there

334
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,790
and we started the service very basic

335
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,750
service which are on just like on all

336
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,620
good all Linux and good all UNIX without

337
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,340
system D just is a script which which

338
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,770
means the sensor every 20 seconds and we

339
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,780
have a class to build such a service so

340
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,850
I can show you some some piece of code

341
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,870
maybe higher

342
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,939
[Music]

343
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,330
so for your toe just an example with IOT

344
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,420
you can you can put a tool inside of

345
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:27,520
recipes call for example in in order to

346
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,780
to change

347
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,658
and

348
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,050
another to

349
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,950
and then you had a new new new file with

350
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:07,240
with automatic starting and wlan0 issue

351
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,750
develop discrete to program so it is the

352
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,940
program to control the I square C Center

353
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:24,820
is one C program and you add some fries

354
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,010
- to write a simple script to build a

355
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,920
dynamic dynamic webpage is very

356
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,860
old-fashioned it's just for the demo but

357
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,730
I like the old-fashioned things I'm

358
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:49,190
Dino's also okay so you can also is it

359
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,350
possible to get okay so unruly dots but

360
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:57,280
we can start the demo demonstration

361
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,430
I hope so

362
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,970
so we can you can see the GP the p0

363
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,600
booting

364
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,019
it's quite fast for linux should be

365
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,230
without the network it's faster but

366
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,450
without the network is difficult to get

367
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,380
IOT one yourself

368
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:46,040
okay it's okay so it's okay for well I

369
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,150
have a problem with my my PC it's okay

370
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,740
on the board but not on the PC no

371
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,900
because I need to be under Android that

372
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,330
spot that I don't know why he doesn't

373
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,659
walk

374
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,639
what I'm not sure pocket no not for

375
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:12,090
dinner

376
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,490
not for them no no meant to dream okay

377
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,480
okay but it's not a problem

378
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,690
hmm so-so yeah so it's 20 20.7 degrees

379
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,280
yeah I'm not sure

380
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,530
so it's under the tire

381
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,029
the count was income

382
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,490
sounds like that way 150 yeah

383
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,630
okay okay

384
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,429
and it should change you to changes you

385
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,570
put your your finger

386
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:36,299
you should change ways you change yeah

387
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,950
refresh them but there is a there should

388
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,330
be an automatic refresh button

389
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,740
[Laughter]

390
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:06,279
so we have 36 seconds so just to talk

391
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,600
about another use case he is just some

392
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
so what's about to a walk was done by

393
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,270
Nicaragua in Toulouse it's more complex

394
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,659
demonstration based on unreal IOT device

395
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,909
with 6lowpan and we use the Raspberry Pi

396
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,960
as a bodnariu to run in New York - and

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,730
it's a based on a center of tag it's

398
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,860
it's device from texas instrument with

399
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,500
the cortex-m with the mop overwrites

400
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,620
kuwaiti it's it's really it's a VR ilt

401
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,630
device and we use a software which is

402
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,980
called 6lb are other software so you get

403
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,260
the data from the tags you send to the

404
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,010
cloud with MQTT etc etc and you can you

405
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,000
can use profanity to Caesar the values

406
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,120
with the web web browser he's very

407
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,640
famous today - everybody speaks about

408
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,270
graph on R so it's much its finer I I

409
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,070
don't understand how or we could walk

410
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,549
that it's fiber is fine ok if you have

411
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:20,129
some question one or two questions

412
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,140
or no question is better no question to

413
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:31,750
get the time yeah one question project

414
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,919
you can change it yeah the question was

415
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,130
you say you say use the RPM in the in

416
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,950
the distribution you can change it in

417
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,100
your configuration you're configuration

418
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,049
that this is the default if you want us

419
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,539
a smaller distribution you can use ipk

420
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:54,669
and it solves the size but I use the RPM

421
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,090
as a test but you can use IP k it's much

422
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:09,039
but not much better for unbidden was

423
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,059
about using missile GDP GDP by default

424
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,179
or Yocto I don't know if you can build a

425
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,320
cross compiler with with musi on Yocto

426
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,659
you can do it on balut but I'm not sure

427
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:35,340
on your toe okay

428
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,419
you
