1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,860
hi everybody I'm happy to see the room

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,280
full again thanks for that so it's our

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,180
last talk and it would be given by hen

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,880
yoke is from Bessette Brazil but he

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,420
lives in in u.s. he works for now for a

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,210
nonprofit organization providing me

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,270
literacy to students and he will talk

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,330
you about oh you can do home monitoring

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:40,980
with Raspberry Pi and Ruby hello

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,950
everybody so let me get started

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,980
and a little bit about myself my name is

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,290
Hayley and I'm working a nonprofit

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,180
organization called commonly it we do

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,850
free literacy tools and student tracking

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,850
tools Muslim students in teachers

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,739
empowering teachers to improve education

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,450
for kids I've been doing software

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,730
development for about 16 years and being

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,930
working for Ruby on Rails

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,520
for about seven years roughly so the

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,229
gender of my talk is gonna follow these

22
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,170
kind of kind of follow these major steps

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,289
which is why help verify parallel ax or

24
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:19,289
micro pcs what is available for you guys

25
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:23,490
to poke around buying stalls set up your

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,190
development environment and the motion

27
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,869
sensor app that I use to more enter my

28
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,690
house when I was on vacation so before I

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,369
started let me just ask real quick

30
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,599
questions here that I think there is

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,750
three main topics in my talk one of them

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,759
is Ruby the other one is Raspberry Pi

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,280
and parallel and the other one is ghost

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,119
stories

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,590
so with here who who is with these wrong

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,739
reads like Ruby on Rails developer can

37
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:50,660
you his rent

38
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,229
who is raspberry PI's kind of like stuff

39
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,550
and how about goes to stories all right

40
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,840
cool

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,250
so let me get started so why Raspberry

42
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,959
Pi in parallel is so there's not a lot

43
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,669
of thing here in these like that's kind

44
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,800
of serious but I was curious

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,260
I was not bored and I was indeed doing

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
some renovations in my house and pretty

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,130
much all these restarted

48
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,740
because of a high tower I saw one he's

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,120
like even talking a conference a couple

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,490
years ago talking about parallel it's

51
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,470
like oh yeah there is parallel and now

52
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,120
and there is raspberry pie I've heard

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,980
about these things so one day I'm gonna

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,320
poke around that so that's that's how

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,240
these these next sharp returned my

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,120
career started so what is available

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,310
let's talk raspberry pie you have pi 0

58
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,270
pi 1 mod away pi 2 model B by 3 model B

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,550
these are the ones available now and a

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,700
little bit of video for you guys by zero

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,150
by one all of them they pretty much look

62
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,880
like the same difference in size

63
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,010
together a little bit of perspective

64
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,340
these are pies you and that's 1/4 so a

65
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,170
PI 0 is probably the size of your thumbs

66
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,630
like it's like this pi 3 raspberry pi 3

67
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,540
cases like this so that's is this case

68
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,160
over here so this is pretty much the

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
size the PI 3 which is the one that I

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,940
bought and I've been using it is the

71
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,770
size of a credit card and this is that

72
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,090
that case it's a plastic case for

73
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,490
Raspberry Pi 3 a little bit of the

74
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,120
differences between them so you see

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,270
mostly what's matter to me is CPU and

76
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,190
RAM so you can see pi 0 which is

77
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,530
seroquel gigabyte by a PI pi 1 a plus PI

78
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,020
2 pi 3 their quad-core processors

79
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,790
already and the PI 3 B which is the

80
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,490
latest one that was released maybe your

81
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,040
so ago it's like 1.2 quite quad is the

82
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,020
one that I've been poking around and

83
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,130
this was also the first one to have

84
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,640
wireless and Bluetooth there is one

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,710
interesting thing about these PI 1 a

86
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,380
plus which is that is the low power is

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,160
like 1 watts and half a watt and usually

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,779
they recommend this if you want to

89
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,548
wonder the scenario that they describe

90
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,080
that this is useful for is for if L

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,580
button or something that is gonna fly

92
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,050
around and is gonna collect some data

93
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,900
you really need no power because

94
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,910
is up in the air is not in your in your

95
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,770
desk that's the one for it but it

96
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,860
doesn't have that an ad so it is for

97
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,509
embedded stuff not for you to poke

98
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,190
around in your basement as far as price

99
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,130
goes the pi zero is five dollars freakin

100
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,810
cheap the pi 3 goes to $40 about

101
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,139
dimensions of them in some GPIO s all

102
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,380
the latest ones they have followed GPIO

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,300
pins for you to plug senses and whatever

104
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,780
you want so now moving on to parallel

105
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,940
parallel a is a pretty much another

106
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,410
Raspberry Pi board and they have these

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,720
three options so Microsoft desktop an

108
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,110
embedded although they are pretty much

109
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,300
the same close to the same size they are

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,900
quite different in price in power all

111
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,410
the parallels they have 18 cores and

112
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,440
they start the starting price is $99 in

113
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,800
the embedded one is it tooth to 60 so

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,699
they all comes with one gigabyte of ram

115
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,500
the desktop independent has HDMI the

116
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,620
Microsoft doesn't and they have only one

117
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,260
USB port so you need to plug something

118
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,210
else if you want to poke around if that

119
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,669
mouse keyboard you're not that kind of

120
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,889
stuff and the desktop has 24 ports

121
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,599
embedded 48 I haven't bought one of

122
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,449
those yet but it's not my to do this as

123
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,280
soon as I finish all this stuff that I

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,010
want to do with the raspberry PI's I'm

125
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,840
kind of cue to see what these 18 cores

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,430
is really going to do and compare with

127
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,669
the rest berry pie for whatever

128
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,169
application that I usually that I want

129
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,930
to do and to do my homework there are

130
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,780
all the things so Intel as is always big

131
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,940
PC

132
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,240
companies they have their own version so

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,650
this Intel Galileo

134
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,220
Intel value seems to run Linux but the

135
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,949
the answer's no it does and in that one

136
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,740
over here this one it does not come with

137
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,630
a processor you have to buy separately

138
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,090
and there is also these

139
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,889
stick pcs much you've has anybody here

140
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,580
ever used one of these okay two people

141
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,660
all right three so this is mostly

142
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,540
windows-based in the way this is Intel

143
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,520
one and this is an Asus one and the way

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,470
these stuff is you plug in the back of

145
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,850
your monitor and then you have a windows

146
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,270
and that's it

147
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,500
so goodbye install and setup solo now

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,889
let's start getting into into the PI

149
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,880
stuff where to buy element14 other food

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,490
Amazon or anywhere you find these these

151
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,080
micro centers near you so of mine from

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,180
Amazon now what did you buy

153
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,889
that's a good question because depends

154
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,840
on what you're gonna do if you like

155
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
balloons and you want to put you you're

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,500
buying a balloon you have to go to PI

157
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,539
one because that's the low-power and

158
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,330
that's the one you need if you're not if

159
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,889
you're gonna do these stuff on your

160
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,010
basement in your house then you probably

161
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,430
should go with the PI 3 which is the

162
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,039
latest one has Wi-Fi in at a net that's

163
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,280
the one I started in for you to find

164
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,650
these starter kits which comes with a PI

165
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,039
3 PI a key is a power supply heat sink

166
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
and you're going to need to buy these

167
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,030
stuffs up these SD cards that's the

168
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,210
basics with daddy you can have a Linux

169
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,639
running on your machine on your home in

170
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,250
poke around with that you plug in a

171
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,410
monetary not only the TV and that's it

172
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,440
you don't need much more than that

173
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,099
extras on these cameras sensors in a 7

174
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:32,589
screen 7 inch touchscreen display all my

175
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,659
first with my static kid I also bought

176
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,190
some sensors because I want to do a home

177
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,200
pointer in a motion presence app so I

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,059
bought that at the beginning and then

179
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,190
later on I did bought the camera in the

180
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,370
7 inch display 7 inch touch screen which

181
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,890
is this one this is the 7 inch with a

182
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,900
case in the Raspberry Pi is here the

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,709
back there is a board in this is the

184
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,080
Raspberry Pi board over here

185
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,690
so let's keep going

186
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,890
installing setup so depending on what

187
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,990
machine use at home Windows Linux and

188
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,740
Mac these are some references if you do

189
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,440
use Linux as your main laptop at home or

190
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,410
work I suggest you go for the second

191
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,060
reference which is from Ubuntu mate

192
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,640
they're just gonna fuse at home to you

193
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
the other one is more perhaps for

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,360
Windows or Mac users and now I kind of I

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,550
am added a third of my talk and I want

196
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,960
to kind of breathe here a little bit and

197
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,300
I want you guys to look at the slide if

198
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,680
there is one thing that I want you guys

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,420
to remember is what is written on the

200
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,560
slide so if you were very start and

201
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,660
start working with raspberry pi for the

202
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,279
first time because you came here and

203
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,740
listen to me this is what I want you

204
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,580
guys to remember so my tip to you as

205
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,100
soon as you start installing OS is in I

206
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,750
mean I'm talking about Linux not talking

207
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,120
about Windows but the system you sign or

208
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,960
installing a Linux OS that's what you

209
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,620
end up execute a couple of commands that

210
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,140
will have some of these ones in one of

211
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
them is BS equals 232 m and the other

212
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,040
one is BS equals to 1 a.m. and I hope

213
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
that you remember me about these and you

214
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,540
for the first time you use BS equals to

215
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,810
1 M because if you use the other one and

216
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,270
you happen to follow the steps I

217
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,210
followed you're gonna miss a lot of

218
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,280
hours of your life troubleshooting

219
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,270
something without finding a solution and

220
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,330
and I think it's related to that BS 32 M

221
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,300
which is kind of box size 32 megabytes

222
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,440
versus block size 1 megabyte so I spend

223
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,410
I bought this stuff as a Kuto I comes at

224
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,180
home you're going to the family go to

225
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,339
sleep and you go to your office you do

226
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,930
some walking to poke around if your new

227
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,779
toy and you spend 5 hours in there

228
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,580
trying to install a freaking Linux on it

229
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,970
and it doesn't work then you go to sleep

230
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,980
really sad because your new toy doesn't

231
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,620
work so that's kind of what happened

232
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,209
with me from 10 a.m. to

233
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,768
3 a.m. the morning something like that

234
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,399
download so these are the three main OSS

235
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,040
that I'd like to try and that I picked

236
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,410
at the beginning so quois just a plain

237
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,529
linux core there is no graphic interface

238
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,129
open Tomb 18 another one that has a nice

239
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:34,679
a nice set of installation steps pretty

240
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,089
cool and in there is these things with

241
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,610
no windows thing for IOT core like what

242
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,720
I like

243
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
ok I mean you decide to try so when are

244
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,079
you starting I bought on one of these

245
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,660
that's the cards and then I bought two

246
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,959
mores and this is automate this is

247
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,480
Ubuntu core this is what I've been

248
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,970
trying to do with Windows so it's still

249
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,199
my to-do list so there's still the

250
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,110
package so if you are a Mac user and

251
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,970
you're gonna install one of these Linux

252
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,540
machines in your SD card you mostly

253
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,610
gonna run these three commands a DD

254
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,730
lives in those references you have more

255
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,040
step-by-step on how to execute in these

256
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,619
and what to do and I have one is light

257
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,029
at the end with all the references then

258
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,889
I'm gonna publish these after the talk

259
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,410
and you guys can look around but

260
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,149
basically you're gonna run these 3d

261
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,089
released to find you're gonna I mean I

262
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,410
mean let me go from the beginning so

263
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,029
you're gonna download an image you're

264
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,399
gonna own archive and you're gonna stick

265
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,980
SD card in a Mac and then the source

266
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,029
that is done and you're gonna run your

267
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,619
detail list which is just gonna find

268
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,079
what is your SD Drive you're going to do

269
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,600
a disk you to you to amount my desk to

270
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,249
and then you're going to do this DD

271
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:00,600
which kind of which kind of installed

272
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,069
that Linux distribution on your SD and

273
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,869
the third one is the one is going to

274
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,920
take a little longer maybe 20 to 30

275
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,110
minutes and then as soon as you have

276
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,029
your SD card all done with your

277
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,589
the ox on it and you're gonna put on the

278
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:25,750
pot on the on the rest bury pipe plug in

279
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,330
the in the power put on a morning tour

280
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,020
and or a TV or anything like that and

281
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,390
and you're gonna put so the first boot

282
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,480
will take a little longer and you're

283
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,520
gonna be sweaty because you want these

284
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,180
to work and sometimes I depend on the

285
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,830
open to that you decide it all so much

286
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,570
gonna extend a file system if you use

287
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,040
the wood to mate you have to manually do

288
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,570
that but there is a simple command in

289
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,940
there in the in the installation

290
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,770
procedures that you just need to run and

291
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,850
is easy and fast you may need to do

292
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,260
something else so just follow

293
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,209
instructions on the display you may need

294
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,459
to configure a network and create an

295
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,709
enemy an admin account the first one

296
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,110
that you have and this is a little

297
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,890
picture of my Raspberry Pi my TV and a

298
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,500
keyboard so if you look over here this

299
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,279
is more a small display here is exactly

300
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,339
these boards which is the seven-inch the

301
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,730
7-inch display with the of the pile back

302
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,220
and that's my living room TV and a

303
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,760
keyboard and mouse that I was using

304
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,829
that's what I use for all the stuff that

305
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,690
I did for the testing program my TV

306
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,829
because I don't have a HDMI monitor in I

307
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:45,640
have the TV so in disease the Raspberry

308
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,890
Pi this is exactly this box in what you

309
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,070
see over here is these emotions infrared

310
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,380
motion sensor with a black tape on the

311
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,170
kind of covering tube to minimize the

312
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,810
noise and so I could test so this is

313
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,430
actually what I end up installing in my

314
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:07,329
house and that I did my experiment so as

315
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:14,110
soon as you get so you can use your TV

316
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,990
to TV monitor a keyboard that you use or

317
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,480
your Raspberry Pi you can use the seven

318
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,110
touch seven-inch touchscreen or you can

319
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,209
just access H to your chilliness machine

320
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,370
for whatever laptop you have so as soon

321
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,880
as you do that then you have your Linux

322
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,220
the rest by the Raspberry Pi is done

323
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,920
the installation is done now it's just

324
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,200
another Linux machine that you are

325
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,550
poking around

326
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,500
so now as soon as now then you have that

327
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,140
Linux machine in there let's do some

328
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,460
development right so my main developer

329
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,050
environment is playing old Ruby style IV

330
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,290
my being v post which PG atomy and text

331
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,620
editor browser and I hook these up on my

332
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,140
TV and then I have it I kind of talk

333
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,780
about it even the keyboard and just SSH

334
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,000
from our Mac to there to the to the PI

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,850
and then do some stuff in there using

336
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,640
vim but but you can do whatever if it's

337
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,430
better for you

338
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,980
the playing Ruby on Rails development

339
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,120
environment as you get as as classic as

340
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,750
it gets so this is a seven inch touch

341
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,000
screen there is a reference in there

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,630
it crosses twice close to three times

343
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,890
more than the pie itself so but if you

344
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,020
plan to do some infotainment system or

345
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,580
do anything that requires some kind of

346
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,950
display for someone else or then you do

347
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,500
so you may need that it does not look

348
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,180
well and does not play well if you want

349
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,550
to poke around the Linux itself because

350
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,220
the screen is too small for you to to

351
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,740
open a terminal to type a bunch of

352
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,110
terminal commands but but it it can be

353
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,170
used it can be used as well and this is

354
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,339
an image that is started I just pull it

355
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,140
up that will you see my login page my

356
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,530
login screen this is a terminal screen

357
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,349
my my keyboard and a mouse somewhere in

358
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:17,760
there

359
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,619
these diesel-engine screen also have a

360
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,199
soft a soft keyboard that's what you see

361
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,449
in the bottom and then you can type in

362
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,780
here but it's small you're not going to

363
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,770
be able to type you're gonna need to

364
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,690
need some some pins to do like you do on

365
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,460
a tablet you're not going to be able to

366
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,010
use that to type anything

367
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,680
softly follow related I wasn't able so

368
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,630
now let's moving forward let's go to

369
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,160
your motion sensor app that's what

370
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,460
wanting to do from the first place

371
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,320
so that is my hello world for Raspberry

372
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,090
Pi that's the one that it said to do and

373
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,160
basically what I want apart from these

374
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,550
motion sensor app it's pretty simple

375
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,620
detect a movement in as soon as you

376
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,170
detect a movement you do something which

377
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,080
is and then if you go into the Ruby on

378
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,910
Rails Ruby world is calling an API it's

379
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,730
pretty simple sounding alarm then you go

380
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,670
back to the PI and maybe you can use an

381
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,030
external buzzer to do that turn on the

382
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,740
lights and play the music again you go

383
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,020
back to the PI interface out tone of the

384
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,460
camera record something make a video

385
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,080
from from what I what are your

386
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,830
surroundings are in in stop when there

387
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,870
is no more presence and then you report

388
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,490
an event in the video so those are the

389
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,559
kind of stuff that you can do the idea

390
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,850
of that is a very simple code to do this

391
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,790
na over here don't detect presence

392
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,210
turn on the camera record and then turn

393
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,550
off the camera on the Raspberry Pi

394
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,320
website I can probably try to find that

395
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,929
that link and putting the references

396
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:04,750
it's 20 lines of code and you can do

397
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,320
that in Ruby in Python and my motion

398
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,090
sensor app is started very very simple

399
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,410
because I don't want to build a motion

400
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,710
sensor app I want to build I want a

401
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,630
point to the sensor but if we look at

402
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,850
the data model just users has location

403
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,840
sensors events and data if you wanna

404
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,670
locations in sensors can be kind of a

405
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,980
bundle together but if you want to have

406
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,160
separate my living room or one house a

407
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,260
house being house EU user can do that

408
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,030
and then each house has a bunch of

409
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,010
sensors and each sensor has the events

410
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,559
and integrated at a-- which is the video

411
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,170
or whatever else data you capture sound

412
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,070
or anything and I wanted to build these

413
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:53,130
basic happy because I want you detect

414
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,140
presence of my house and I want to be

415
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,990
able to see that from my cell phone from

416
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,820
outside my house you

417
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,430
and I use one of these aluminum rails to

418
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,250
build it is very simple app they just

419
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,420
create a sensor and allowing you to log

420
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,640
in and deployed it to here oh cool and

421
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,470
that's what it looks like that's how

422
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,740
it's always monitoring my house and that

423
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,230
you do in an hour or something maybe a

424
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,790
little bit more you build that that

425
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,220
that's simple app for you to to collect

426
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,290
and store the data that's that's been

427
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,860
generated by your sensors in by by

428
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,690
monitoring whatever environment you are

429
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,630
in now comes back now to these infrared

430
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,400
motion sensor this is the one that I

431
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,190
used his digital one that I tested that

432
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,560
I left in the cap the black tape in

433
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,030
there just to minimize the area and try

434
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,030
to get less noise but basically these

435
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,740
these are all the same this is another

436
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,980
one that I bought in this is a zoom

437
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,120
version of the end it's just infrared

438
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,700
infrared motion sensor and basically

439
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,160
there is a nice reference if you occurs

440
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,380
about infrared motion sensor I strongly

441
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,590
suggest you to read this PDF it's pretty

442
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,620
cool and that's where I got this picture

443
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,190
and basically the infrared sensor has

444
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,070
two areas the red and the green which is

445
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,990
the hot in the cold so when the heat

446
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,270
comes through the to the head to the

447
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,060
heart area the pi the sensor is going to

448
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,340
generate a high voltage as soon as you

449
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,140
leave that and you go to the cold and

450
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,090
you leave the area the the sensation is

451
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,270
a low voltage that's pretty much roughly

452
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,100
from what I understood that's how this

453
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,110
sensor works but in that PDF there is a

454
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,430
lot of a lot more information about

455
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,270
these and but that's what I thought I

456
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,430
was smart enough to share with you guys

457
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:56,440
and now motoring essential so this is a

458
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,150
little bit of code I use this gem called

459
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,420
Pied Piper and the reference is theirs

460
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,430
and github is open-source and all of

461
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,940
that and this is a pretty simple Ruby

462
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,170
code that actually does my monitoring

463
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,610
because the one thing that I wanted most

464
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,350
used to get these stuff working my heart

465
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:21,230
so you run these on on your that's

466
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,190
what's gonna be running on your

467
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,220
Raspberry Pi and basically what it does

468
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,700
here is I have my pin 14 my P 14 it's I

469
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,140
don't think I'm gonna be able to show

470
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,539
this but it's a GPIO pin where you just

471
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:37,070
put some jumper cables and these cables

472
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,220
here this connects to the to the sensor

473
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,230
and the other side goes directly into

474
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,889
your pie so in that P 14 that's where

475
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,559
the motion sensors connect the data is

476
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,480
the other two cables of the motion

477
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,269
sensor one is power grounded in data and

478
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,740
the data goes in the 14 and then you say

479
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,130
hey as soon as 14 goes high throw me an

480
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,659
event and then I'm gonna do something

481
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,429
that means that I detect the sensor

482
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:07,820
detect the presence and and then

483
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,350
basically I do a little bit of logic in

484
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,299
heating all right I don't want to

485
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,059
generate every single little thing going

486
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,269
on through my living room so if if the

487
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:20,750
the burglar or my wife or whatever else

488
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,179
goes to my living room within the same

489
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,700
60 the same unit I'm gonna consider that

490
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
as a single presence I don't want to

491
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,730
have 5 5 motion events within a minute

492
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,220
for the same person walking around and

493
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,899
that's the life that I do on current

494
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:38,120
presence and last presence and these

495
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,639
simple mapping here are to do that and I

496
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:42,529
suppose I do that then I'm reporting I'm

497
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,889
gonna call my their API that the videos

498
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,870
up that I have that has that crud app

499
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:54,380
and also very basic API in it does not

500
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,919
use any common products of API because

501
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,250
this is a post not I get but 3 a.m. in

502
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,460
the morning I I didn't get to reported

503
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,880
sensor and everything is hi decoding

504
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,919
here as soon as I started doing this for

505
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,409
real I had recorded a hero clapping here

506
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,110
on the hero coop the sensor ID is 1 so

507
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,399
these scripts is all going to work for

508
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:23,029
that senior because I didn't have much

509
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,340
time and I just experiment and playing

510
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,029
with it so

511
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,410
and that's how you more into infrared

512
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,080
sensor and one interesting thing in here

513
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,140
now is I'm gonna I'm gonna I think it's

514
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,030
really on four let me make a side note

515
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,260
here I think it's really important that

516
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,480
now live in a world that I cannot travel

517
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,520
we've noticed that with all these

518
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,610
electronics I I wasn't questioned I have

519
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,220
to board an airplane coming from us to

520
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,340
to Europe bringing all these electronics

521
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,460
is the maximum that I bought was these

522
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,500
but I'm gonna but but there is one

523
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,820
interesting aspect to all these things

524
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,280
who use every single scene so regarding

525
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,900
weather is an infrared sensor or

526
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,630
whatever the sensor if they walk in a

527
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,730
high/low then your code is pretty much

528
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,370
the same you know what you have to know

529
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,270
what the binding between these data up

530
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,650
in chains and the field in the raspberry

531
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,450
pi in whatever your cloud system you

532
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,460
have is which sensor goes in which pin

533
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,340
and that is a lot of the deal can be

534
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,559
used to make sure that your PI it's his

535
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,150
leg and you pull the data from the cloud

536
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,700
but to do that but there is nothing like

537
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,580
that and on these de l'ordre hats so let

538
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,950
me show you a little bit of sensor let

539
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,650
me take you on a seesaw journey and show

540
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,480
you some of them so that's the classic

541
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,670
one that I showed you guys the motion

542
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,030
sensor this is a smoke and combustible

543
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,880
gas I think they actually st. is wrong

544
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,500
to me because they seems to be exactly

545
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,920
the same

546
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,200
and but they came as two different

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,059
sensor in this one just guess which one

548
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,510
disease

549
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,370
I'm not sure if I own anything but this

550
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,490
is just a buzzer if you want to want to

551
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,070
play some sound off you detect something

552
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,049
this is a carbon one excited in these

553
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,500
these all for example these also have

554
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,409
the trapeze the power ground and data so

555
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:31,179
it will walk the same way that that the

556
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,380
the deep fried a chance to walk so

557
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,299
you're gonna st. 0 1 and that's gonna

558
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:42,549
drag on a bus or stop buzzing so come on

559
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:45,070
oxide how about this one

560
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:53,019
guess which one this is kind of pressure

561
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:55,630
is a digital touch if you touch your

562
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,309
hand in the air it's gonna throw an

563
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:58,620
event

564
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,929
these are flame alright so I don't want

565
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,330
to check whether Mike houses on fire but

566
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,789
it came on a board and that's fine I

567
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:09,250
have in there this is a vibration these

568
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,470
temperature humidity that that that one

569
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,110
I don't want to poke around and this one

570
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,490
is sound that's interesting as well but

571
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,600
it doesn't seem this one is going to

572
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,429
give you the sounds just gonna say hey

573
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,230
there is some sound level over here and

574
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,470
what this is the coolest one that came

575
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,269
in the box and also the biggest can you

576
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,659
guess which one is this water level

577
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:36,039
exactly

578
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,380
oh man I never could get anybody would

579
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,990
find out that this is a water level

580
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,789
these are water I wanna play around with

581
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:49,690
these so much so my home monitor system

582
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,370
so let me go through now my experiment

583
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,049
that I did on my house this is what I

584
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,090
actually installed on my house I

585
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,149
deployed these these that that app into

586
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:00,000
Heroku and it's going to they're running

587
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,970
and I went on a vacation and a very long

588
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,179
vacation so all my family waited on a

589
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,809
vacation for two months sometimes I

590
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:12,909
remember the simple as to you in our

591
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,549
contractor was he was going to come to

592
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:18,519
the house regularly excited note on this

593
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,710
contractor he he's been doing all the

594
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,000
renovation that we doing the house for

595
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,980
the last four or five years and he was

596
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,840
just they're gonna go to the house walk

597
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,269
through and make sure it's not on fire

598
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:33,399
when we are gone so and I asked him hey

599
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,379
there will be some fish stuff some stuff

600
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,000
during the living room so every time you

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,529
come by you walk around the living room

602
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,389
a couple times as you're doing your

603
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,179
choice but do that for me because I have

604
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,370
this thing that probably you're gonna

605
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,139
have to install my house next to you and

606
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:52,210
I'm gonna test it so and and that's what

607
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,409
happened so we we flew away and November

608
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,029
1st and we killing back and the

609
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,769
experiment was planning to start off

610
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,289
April 1st which is the day that we leave

611
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,490
until you 21st which is

612
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,809
the last day that the contract is

613
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,030
supposed to go at our house before we

614
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,840
come back and I left - honey

615
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,030
I left early stop running look that

616
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,760
seems to on my living room connected the

617
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,460
sensor is there and let me show you a

618
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:25,960
little bit of the log of that so so here

619
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,480
we go it's running localhost but these

620
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,760
oh sorry that is not me

621
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:47,149
okay that is a display

622
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,220
there you go so this is that this is

623
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,030
that rails app that is owned is running

624
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,010
on my on my Mac but it's a backup

625
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,310
database from from what I got reported

626
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,000
on here oh cool

627
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,660
and during that time I got sixty six

628
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,840
hundred seventy nine reports of presence

629
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,940
in my house and I was like whoa so

630
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,500
everything started around there you see

631
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,770
October 29 this is probably some test

632
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,980
the first one I do want to eat you so

633
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,960
November first was the data I was trying

634
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,140
to finish these stuff and get it working

635
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,030
so I had to stay late at night and I was

636
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,000
testing to see Twitter and this is

637
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,360
Twitter

638
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,430
in my time whatever time zone in us 3:45

639
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,560
and the test keep going you see here's

640
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,110
where I realized that you see three

641
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,940
forties when I realized that I need some

642
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,230
kind of timer because I don't want to

643
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,860
see twist three prices because I just

644
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,940
crossed my hand in front of the sensor

645
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,150
that's alright maybe five years or one

646
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,890
minutes is the time that if you pass

647
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,690
he'll detect presence five times in a

648
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,640
minute I just want to find out that that

649
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,370
happen once so that's what I did that

650
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,870
the two minutes the one minute so

651
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,580
November first I kept walking 350 55 4

652
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,510
a.m. for him in there for 20 and then I

653
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:32,290
went sleep and 70 you know my wife my

654
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,600
kids I don't know what happened he is

655
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,150
probably going packing up and going

656
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,900
going on vacation November first then

657
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:48,580
the vehm 5 p.m. and let me keep going

658
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:56,159
here so oh so I went too fast

659
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,210
no we were first 5 p.m. this probably is

660
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,940
packing up and going going traveling and

661
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,429
then here we left the house somewhere on

662
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,009
these but I don't know what happened at

663
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:14,789
that night at my house and it kept going

664
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:19,619
you see it 3 a.m. I know the contractor

665
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,299
that was going to my house pretty well

666
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,830
and that is extremely unlikely was him

667
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,359
so but I have to make a side another

668
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:37,080
side note here and he this guy in the he

669
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,549
he believes in ghosts

670
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,149
he believed in ghosts once a couple of

671
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:43,979
years ago and he came back for another

672
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:46,529
for another round the renovation of the

673
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,409
house and he said we're talking about

674
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,749
something like hey there is a lot I see

675
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:54,089
a lot of noise in your house there's

676
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:55,919
something going on in here and again

677
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,479
he's scared of that so but anyway and

678
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,369
that happened way before I started

679
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,200
working with this pi stuff he we had

680
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,549
this conversation and so my sister kept

681
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,690
going the my sister kept going the

682
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,210
infrared motion sensor cap detecting

683
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,719
infrared where that is and this was

684
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:24,559
installed in my living room near my TV

685
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,320
it was winter in u.s. so the house was

686
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,830
the the the heating system was coming

687
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,039
and going as is too cold and heats up so

688
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,989
it's possible is that I don't know but

689
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:40,469
there was no direct air going into the

690
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,629
scene so again I had the black tape on

691
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:45,179
the sensor so I wasn't trying to catch a

692
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:48,659
lot of his Maltese I just want to see

693
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,809
this walking and this kept going

694
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:57,960
November 3rd four five six at all times

695
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,059
of the day during the day at night and

696
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,369
afternoon some of these days I've really

697
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:03,749
my contractor here come to the house and

698
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,339
check it out make sure that everything

699
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:11,760
is fine November 8th and then they kept

700
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,770
going so I'm not gonna keep going

701
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,949
here but if you keep if you scroll to

702
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,679
these that's gonna keep going and I was

703
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,060
gone and you see every time in the from

704
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,690
2:00 to 4:00 every time between 1:00

705
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,668
a.m. and 4:00 a.m. there was some event

706
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,790
and even if my contractor went to my

707
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,380
house to throw some parties when I'm

708
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,630
gone he didn't do that every day

709
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,370
so and that kept going kept going then

710
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,610
one day I called him or he called me and

711
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,290
I told him that this was happening and

712
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,969
he told guess what he told me I told you

713
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,719
that he's a ghost in your house

714
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,320
around November 19 I asked him to shut

715
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,480
down because when I when I said that

716
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,760
this was happening in the house you know

717
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm not going there you know in this all

718
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,180
right go power off that stuff go that

719
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,980
unplug from the power and that's it

720
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,940
I'm done of my sensor with my my

721
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,870
experiment and it was plain to to lesson

722
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,180
to you December but it just took a

723
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,920
couple weeks now let me make this play

724
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,150
off and come back to my presentation

725
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,870
so there are also my experiment and so

726
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,030
here goes here my tear is right so what

727
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,990
happened in my house so what I think is

728
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,900
there is a ghost in my house it's it's

729
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,810
possible that that's happening and that

730
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,940
ghost is generating so infrared in my

731
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,100
scene so ending the suit as soon as the

732
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,960
gold wakes up and walk to my house it

733
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,760
that takes place in my system as my

734
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,040
sensor is detecting that my infrared

735
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,080
sensor is detecting that so the other

736
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,690
theory is there is a infrared noise near

737
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,740
my sensor which is I don't know which

738
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,860
one is more likely but it's a

739
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,440
possibility the other possibility is my

740
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,120
sister is broken that's another thing

741
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,090
hard to test that's not like pushing

742
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,590
your code to github and let you see I

743
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,330
run your test that's not how you test

744
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,600
sensors you know it's it's hard to find

745
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,030
out what's broken or not but I do

746
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,350
suspect this one is broken can be a bug

747
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,080
in my code I walk on the cold every

748
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,460
night from 10:00 10:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.

749
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,860
not every night but I didn't have a lot

750
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,310
of time before I travel and because I'm

751
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,350
one of these to leave these were running

752
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,720
on my house at my house when I was gone

753
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,880
I didn't have much time I had to finish

754
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,370
by the time I was always leaving and so

755
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,390
but the code is pretty straight for

756
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,030
almost like the sensor is broken all

757
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,340
these some noise I don't know maybe

758
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,460
there is a ghost

759
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,370
so here all the references that I read

760
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,950
throughout the code the presentation and

761
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,840
that's what I came up here to talk to

762
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,700
you guys so thank you for your time

763
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,459
if you have any questions I'll be more

764
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,979
than happy to answer we have 10 minutes

765
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:39,669
for questions

766
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:52,359
no questions can you repeat the

767
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,019
beginning of the question okay so the

768
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,509
question is if I have multiple PI's or

769
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:04,119
only one part multiple files at to the

770
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,720
house right no I only have one so far I

771
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,269
only bought one and in my idea from my

772
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:15,099
next renovation project the house is you

773
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,799
can install maybe two one in the front

774
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,739
door and one on the back door the house

775
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:42,759
I'll program try to do that sometime so

776
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:44,049
the question is what are the bugging

777
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,730
tools that I used to troubleshoot the PI

778
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,519
and if I if I put this D in a boot up

779
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,910
and it doesn't run what I do so that's a

780
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,599
good question

781
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,140
I didn't use any fancy tools the problem

782
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,880
that I had was that block size 32

783
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,880
megabytes I Google the heck out of that

784
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,499
to see if I could find anything I

785
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,390
couldn't find nothing explaining work

786
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,480
why I was breaking why my PI was not the

787
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,180
land closing stocking up for the sensory

788
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,839
stuff

789
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:13,869
that's a simple script and so there is

790
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:17,049
not a lot of I never really came across

791
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:19,180
any to to test the sensor itself but

792
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,390
it's just logging and so didn't will use

793
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,779
any any debugging tool other than trying

794
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:29,700
to find an answer on the Internet

795
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:40,460
any more question zero

796
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,089
okay I'm not sure for follow question

797
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,890
okay so the question is if there is a

798
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,130
way to measure how hot is the sensor so

799
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,340
this is infrared so just give you high

800
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,860
and low but I do believe there are some

801
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,110
temperature sensor that can give you

802
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,850
like the water layer the order level is

803
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,200
going to give you something else other

804
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,110
than two of us it has to give you 10 20

805
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,720
30 whatever percentage on that level so

806
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,670
that's gonna vary by sense of icing

807
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,250
answer most likely since like that you

808
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,250
may need more than three pins or maybe

809
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,690
is gonna find everything I everything

810
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,790
changes I give you a number so I'll give

811
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,490
a 1029 in that case only one pin should

812
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:46,720
be enough so the question is if I if I

813
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
for looking to change my protein use a

814
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,300
camera to detect that's that's an

815
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,780
interesting question

816
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,600
yeah so instead instead of the technique

817
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,460
for red in the cell there is any Friday

818
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,730
here you yeah you keep you keep taking

819
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,040
pictures and then you detect movement

820
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,480
and you compare you can compare images

821
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,240
in see if there's anything else I think

822
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,120
the one reason why I would I didn't go

823
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,000
for that is because I wanna test the

824
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,520
sensor itself the camera is just soft

825
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,140
when you put a camera in the USB and

826
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,150
then a bunch of software doing that the

827
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,620
seems to know the series of you so hard

828
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,600
that you have to jump in and your cable

829
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,140
into the pie and do that so that's why I

830
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,690
decided to do that but I do want to

831
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,240
extend that to use that or the code that

832
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,790
detects the presence in light up the

833
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,460
camera record because if there is a

834
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,770
ghost in my house maybe the cameras will

835
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,490
tell me something

836
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,619
any more question do you resolve the

837
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:57,220
case I know no I have not I have not

838
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,360
resolved the kids what about the mouse

839
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,160
it could be a mouse that only gets in my

840
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,840
house when we are gone because I never

841
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,180
seen a mouse living there for five for

842
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,890
four years I had never seen a mouse in

843
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,170
the house so but it could be is that

844
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,280
maybe it's math mouse and it only comes

845
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,260
fly the one reason that I put that tape

846
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,290
in there is so the the infrared sensor

847
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,470
has two tuning parameters one is

848
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,480
sensitives in one it's timing

849
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,570
I told that really down but to the

850
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,700
minimum sensitivity possible and I put a

851
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,340
tape to try to go around that so if the

852
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,200
fly goes around is not gonna hit the

853
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,880
sensor but it could be so maybe the

854
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,290
camera was going to help me to find out

855
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:47,830
if there is a fly and mouse thank you

856
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,990
for for asking this question so the

857
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,000
question is why do what do I use the

858
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
rack for I mean the question is I still

859
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,250
don't know this is a freaking cool toy

860
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,480
this is a this is a Raspberry Pi cluster

861
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,900
so over here we have five boards one one

862
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,800
two three four and five on top this is a

863
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,990
switch that connects all of them at a

864
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,109
net arm and you can get out to the web

865
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:22,090
and at the bottom is a 500 gigabyte SD

866
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,480
card in all these spies they have Linux

867
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,690
using NFS so that instead of using the

868
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,119
SD card this study to give is SD card

869
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,730
using Linux an offense on the SD on the

870
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,080
on the SD Drive on the SSD drive and I

871
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,040
got this picture from the references

872
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,780
here this is a guy from Google that make

873
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,300
this presentation in DC couple months

874
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,910
ago and he found out this conference

875
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:53,020
here in UK in Europe and you can buy

876
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,880
these and you can buy a camera you can

877
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,570
do that yourself but this cost like $600

878
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,140
so

879
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,720
is not that cheap and I'm still trying

880
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,250
to find a use for that so if you guys

881
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,230
have any idea let me know because I

882
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,210
really interested in buying one of those

883
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,890
but for that kind of money I need to

884
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:14,170
find a better usage or than in hunting

885
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:23,800
ghosts so the question is if the pie can

886
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,780
boot directly from the NFS I don't know

887
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,820
I that's a good question but on that

888
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,440
link there is a whole article that the

889
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,960
guy did he it is possible that he did

890
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,220
something but it's possible that he he

891
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,860
might have an SD card in here I'm not

892
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,540
sure if we can put directly from the NFS

893
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:53,970
but it's all UNIX we tried using NFS

894
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,870
okay yeah you may need SD because you

895
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,910
need to get the Linux something the

896
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,770
Linux in there the under Linux no that

897
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,820
needs to go to the NFS

898
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,649
[Applause]
