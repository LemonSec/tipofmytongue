1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
I'm going to introduce our next speaker

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,870
[Applause]

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,940
[Music]

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,089
[Applause]

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,190
[Applause]

6
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,248
[Music]

7
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,060
yeah

8
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:37,670
so that's great fullscreen made in 500k

9
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,410
nice to see you my name is Pascal as he

10
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:46,830
told you been in the project fall on the

11
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,380
nike reboot project how many people use

12
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,270
Firefox night in the room just that I

13
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,560
know okay so that's a third so I hope

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,479
that at the end of the talk like the 2/3

15
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,759
that don't use nightly we'll try it

16
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,580
people that don't have it

17
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,959
that's Firefox the code that was just

18
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,370
checked in so that was the code from

19
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,030
yesterday and the code from the morning

20
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,830
that's the six full weeks of our train

21
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,070
model we have we release every six weeks

22
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,280
a new version of Firefox and first it

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,810
goes through the nightly stage and then

24
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,690
Aurora and then beta and then release so

25
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,510
that's not final work that's working

26
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,940
progress their bags it's expected and

27
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,459
that's why we need you

28
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,570
many experimental features so so the the

29
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,610
thing that is not so nice it's like it's

30
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,310
pitched more crushing it's not as stable

31
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,860
but the nice thing is that you get to

32
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,360
experiments all of the new features in

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Firefox weeks months and sometimes even

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,239
a couple of years before some because

35
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,670
some some features take a very long time

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,160
to to get in a fire in the final release

37
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,230
like your multiprocessor example so use

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,769
it why do we need the Firefox nightly

39
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,400
uses so basically this is a community

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,209
talk

41
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,060
we need Firefox nightly users because we

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,519
need your feedback we need to know

43
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,730
what's broken we need to know what was

44
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,830
working and is

45
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,080
no longer working we need to know which

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,580
websites are no longer working with

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,250
Firefox before it reached which is the

48
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,250
big audience the the hundreds of

49
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,010
millions of people we don't have many 90

50
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,170
users and if we had a lot more mighty

51
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,250
users that would definitely help us that

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,730
would help us prioritize and work on

53
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,800
crashes that will help us find

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,380
regulations that would help us having a

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,260
better support for Mac OS and Linux

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,600
because we have so few users on these

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,960
early pre-release channels on smaller

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,200
platforms that is hard to find to detect

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,430
all the bugs before the heat release is

60
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:18,738
that we merging some features from into

61
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,490
geckos experiments on rendering engine

62
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,480
it's great it allows using multiple

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,540
cores to process ESS it allows using the

64
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,910
GPU it's much more modern but it's not

65
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,710
the end user but there are some parts

66
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,600
that are really cool and we want them in

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,140
Firefox so currently we are merging this

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,700
code yesterday the server repository was

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,060
put into the gecko repository has a

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,990
vendor branch that means that by the end

71
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,760
of the year you will have a brand-new

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,370
Firefox with a new engine that means we

73
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,830
are going to break a lot of stuff so we

74
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,640
need a lot of feedback a lot of what was

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,260
working my website is no longer working

76
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,640
the CSS is blocking this this is bad

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,380
this is a regression this is faster this

78
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,800
is not faster and so this is also why we

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,870
need more nightly users because all of

80
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,910
this work is going to happen on nightly

81
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,750
so for many months nobody will know

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,780
about what companies like in real life

83
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,930
except nightly uses people that compile

84
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,520
it and very important thing is that I

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,870
think that nightly is a great vehicle

86
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,740
to get all technical community involved

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,720
like we have a lot of people involved in

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,870
Mozilla but I think we didn't create

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,200
such a great job involving the technical

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,290
community that we have there are tens of

91
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,780
thousands of people that use nightly we

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,220
don't have tens of thousands of people

93
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,350
that report bugs on the daily basis that

94
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,810
write patches that talk with the

95
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,780
developers and that brings us their IDs

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,060
so so there is something that has to be

97
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,490
fixed there and I really hope that we

98
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,280
can grow the size of this community yet

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,260
the people already using lighting more

100
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,970
involved and the people not using

101
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,590
lightly involving Mozilla so who are

102
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,170
they so usually when I talk to my

103
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,240
colleague they tell me that's Linux

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,700
crowd and the people that go to France

105
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,230
them and that's not true we have Linux

106
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,580
users the Mac yeah but but that's not a

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,350
majority of the people a majority of the

108
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,210
people that use my t-there on Windows

109
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,190
there is a difference with the release

110
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,560
channel like we also have a majority of

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,480
people on Windows except that we have a

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,850
lot of Windows XP on the on on the

113
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,440
release channel and a lot of Windows 10

114
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
on a knife-edge channel so of course

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,920
these people are not totally

116
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,200
representative of what we have on the

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,050
release channel but it's not that far

118
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,790
who are they what language do they speak

119
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,400
so it's interesting that we have Firefox

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
users all around the world we don't have

121
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,050
Firefox nightly users all around the

122
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,220
world it's only a few countries 15

123
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,640
countries do like 70% of our user base

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,360
and that's mostly the US Canada Western

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,400
Europe Russia is the big one and Japan

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,910
so that's that's not create there's a

127
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,350
lot of people that could give us

128
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,720
feedback that could tell us their bank

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,420
is broken in Cambodia and we don't know

130
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,760
about it we know about it can be filed

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,020
backs

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,180
when it's based on traditional so that's

133
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,580
not great the other interesting thing is

134
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,370
that most of the 90 users use the

135
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,139
English version it's not because you can

136
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,139
hear me so I'm not created English it's

137
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,479
just that for years it was impossible to

138
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,550
find the localized versions people

139
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,860
thought that didn't exist but actually

140
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,449
they were there on lefty pieces use the

141
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,150
English version except the Russians

142
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:23,340
because they because so that's not great

143
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,979
because we also need a feedback on the

144
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,380
quality of the localization we need

145
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,930
people to use something that the end

146
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,580
user in their country is going to use

147
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,020
and most of the people they are not

148
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,849
going to use the English version so it

149
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,919
is some text that goes outside of the

150
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,529
box that is unreadable that just doesn't

151
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,469
make sense we don't know because people

152
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,070
use the English version so that's the

153
00:08:47,070 --> 00:09:01,080
map where my key users basically and

154
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,630
that's so that's really something to fix

155
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,230
it's not just countries that have

156
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,790
internet penetration people don't have

157
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,400
access to computers now we we have very

158
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,500
low numbers very dramatic numbers in

159
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,320
countries where there is a general

160
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,209
education there is good internet access

161
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,130
and we have lots of Firefox users so we

162
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,430
miss something there is something that

163
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,150
isn't it doesn't feel like eight months

164
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,360
ago I started the nightly reboot stages

165
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
as part of the release management team

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,520
and to see what what could we do what

167
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,200
could we do to get like Morpha and

168
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,880
ninety users what could we do to get

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
them like more involved to get more

170
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,040
information on crashes to give you an

171
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,110
idea we have so few crashes on the

172
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,990
nightly channel that we don't know if

173
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,700
the crash is going to weeks to become

174
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,589
explosive on the release channel or not

175
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,500
so when we have to prioritize work

176
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,720
between crew crashes

177
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,370
we don't have the volume to tell us oh

178
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,470
that looks that to class is going to be

179
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,940
a lot of crushes in the real channel or

180
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,100
or maybe it's going to be 15 crushes on

181
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,480
the run on the release channel because

182
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,980
some gaya is using Firefox on on app or

183
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,920
a PC on the RISC OS platform and that's

184
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,220
nobody we don't have the volume to to

185
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,800
make the informed decision to prioritize

186
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,120
the work for developers as I told you

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,160
that was not a big focus of Mozilla like

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,470
I think we always took for granted that

189
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,620
we had that was providing feedback and

190
00:10:35,620 --> 00:11:07,280
that was in this DP so so people thought

191
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,900
that even exists and there was a

192
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,390
separate download site that had been set

193
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,600
up in 2011 by the web dev team and

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,550
nobody was really updating it like all

195
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,340
templates it was not localized who had

196
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,480
no metrics it wasn't great and it was

197
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
the part of our main domain site so

198
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,760
people really had to I had to google it

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,620
they had to find it and of course there

200
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,480
was no SEO optimization so it was

201
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,340
actually even hard to find if you are

202
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,640
looking for it so now we have all of our

203
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,220
bills on modular dogs and that means we

204
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,880
change some infrastructure that we use

205
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,240
to ship Firefox to have lightly like has

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,850
a real channel there is information in

207
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,400
know tools that channels like doing the

208
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,339
nightly version is this one and we have

209
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,220
this local this local this local so that

210
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,580
was a lot of work and that's the piece

211
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,210
like 15 days after we put it up put it

212
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,940
upon Nagi that we had like 15 languages

213
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,350
that had translated the download page so

214
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,800
my teas also on the previous page we had

215
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,840
we have a previous page that talks about

216
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,120
the dev edition beta he wasn't talking

217
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,280
about 90 a 90 is its main pre really

218
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,320
channel the one that gives us the best

219
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,990
feedback because when people report back

220
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,030
for a regression that happened like

221
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,380
yesterday or three days ago

222
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,920
it's very easy to back it up back it out

223
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,190
if if it's like six weeks 12 weeks 18

224
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,990
weeks later can be like more typically

225
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,580
like just finding the regulation range

226
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,160
and sometimes mechanically you can back

227
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,480
it out because the code has changed too

228
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
much around so it's very important for

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,130
us to get this feedback very early and

230
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,960
it's great that we have download pages

231
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,470
like bookmarks for nightly where the

232
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,750
same as the release channel so they were

233
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,510
telling you do utilize are you looking

234
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,850
for others I think the people that went

235
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,270
to the FTP site to down lightly we can

236
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,050
find a dunce

237
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,320
and and that's that was really the same

238
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
bookmarks for the general public

239
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,390
platform for everybody they make sense

240
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,060
for the general public they don't make

241
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,010
sense for people that are very technical

242
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,320
sorry so we know that its contribution

243
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,050
to contribution they go to ioc channel

244
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,990
we created a noisy channel for nightly

245
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,750
we open the blog so go to a blog visit

246
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,360
let mozilla get get involved like we had

247
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,030
the same get involved link but instead

248
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,580
of going to like a general purpose yeah

249
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,370
get involved mozilla pratik stickers and

250
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,240
so on which is useful small like yeah

251
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,470
right patches

252
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,530
file bugs that's super useful that helps

253
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,480
us that's we don't want to change the

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,460
people that use nightly the people that

255
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,650
news nightly they are tech-savvy that's

256
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,150
great for us doesn't mean that your

257
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,560
computer scientists but that means that

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,140
when they open the bag it's actionable

259
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,790
we can do something about it

260
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,970
the they they can you can have a

261
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,590
conversation with the developer that is

262
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,360
going to fix the bag and the people they

263
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,860
understand each other it's not just like

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,959
as

265
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,690
so that's it's it's very important for

266
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,360
us we have a blog I mentioned it we have

267
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,570
90 users and the problem with 90 is that

268
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,880
it's not a release or actually it's a

269
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,399
release every day and so you don't get

270
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,010
like release notes and even more 90

271
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,329
users but did not know what was new

272
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,350
because if some new feature is in a menu

273
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,529
or if it's a contextual menu or if it's

274
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,570
not like obvious or if it's an option

275
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,970
you you're probably not going to miss it

276
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,160
and think like nothing is happening if

277
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,680
it's not like user facing but there is a

278
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,329
lot of cool stuff that is happening that

279
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,790
is not user facing so we open the blog

280
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,820
last summer and we are inviting

281
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,070
everybody to write to this blood like

282
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,709
that means volunteers as well that not

283
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,750
just until I employees like if somebody

284
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,850
is organizing and even support nightly

285
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,360
in Vietnam that would be great to have a

286
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,130
boss about it like there was a guy who

287
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,170
wrote an article on how to install

288
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,880
Firefox nightly and get it integrated

289
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,310
with Ubuntu unity that's great article

290
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,949
and you get developers that tell us like

291
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:32,630
I'm working on this feature it landed

292
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,240
yesterday give us feedback or you have a

293
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,790
developers that make a recap this week

294
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,699
in Firefox this lambda is dis news

295
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,910
feature this was fixed and so on so

296
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,779
that's that's external communication so

297
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,430
because we have to fix all of the

298
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,589
communication around 90 external and

299
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:56,029
internal the Twitter account is super

300
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,730
active now we have just reached 10,000

301
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,690
followers people eight months ago when I

302
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,430
to covered it with Twitter accounts they

303
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,389
we are like sending angry messages my

304
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,910
Firefox is not working what are you

305
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,310
doing and so on and now they really

306
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,199
interact like beta so I think this is

307
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,449
broken because of this bag can you look

308
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,459
at this because I think it was working

309
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,779
before or not now

310
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,360
so it's a very positive interaction now

311
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,790
and very useful

312
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,519
so that's external communication but we

313
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,410
have like we have set up great internal

314
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,660
communication in Firefox we had this

315
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,970
page about home with with snippets

316
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,030
promotional snippets at the bottom

317
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,060
we never used it for lightly of course

318
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,560
we're not going to tell people I go to

319
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,130
most fast maybe don't have the right the

320
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,490
right Road but if I tell them we have

321
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,280
this this problem and you happier to

322
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,990
have the same configuration and could

323
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,660
you have a look at this bag or if I tell

324
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,360
them like here we have a new menu in in

325
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,310
Firefox nightly to report a broken site

326
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,949
learn about it in this article that

327
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,319
brings the value to the user he

328
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,140
discovers new features that also brings

329
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,199
so that that improves retention like

330
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,640
people know that there is something cool

331
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,619
and they discover the way discover it

332
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,410
and they keep using nightly that that

333
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,260
also helps like growing the community in

334
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,990
the French version of Firefox so this is

335
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,650
this isn't the English version this is

336
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,280
the Spanish one so on this one you see

337
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,380
that's a link to an article about consum

338
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,710
that's the Spanish community panel has

339
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,360
translated this is the French one which

340
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,950
is talking about the needles that is

341
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,950
going to happen in the Paris office in

342
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,640
localizers difference like you can

343
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,140
imagine that somebody that is using

344
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,870
Firefox nightly infringe or in Russian

345
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,480
instead of English this probably

346
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,560
something that is very interested in

347
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
Mozilla and they're also interested in

348
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,010
their own language otherwise it would be

349
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,680
being using the English version so maybe

350
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,750
they could join your localization team

351
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,150
maybe they would be interested so that's

352
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,450
there is a way to interact with the

353
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,480
users and not just with the potential

354
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,980
users what's new page so since nobody

355
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,240
was taking the what's new page had been

356
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,580
deactivated

357
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,380
that's the page that appears every time

358
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,510
you change of cycle like when you go

359
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,040
from five 590 53 to 54 the day changes

360
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,900
that the day your version number changes

361
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,790
you have this page that that gets

362
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,200
displaced

363
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,620
that's very easy thing to set up and now

364
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,120
we have established communication

365
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
channel we've all users we are not like

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,370
spamming them every day within words new

367
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,320
page it's just like every six to eight

368
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,350
weeks we get a message like a nice

369
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,840
reminder a reminder you can get involved

370
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,060
in Mozilla here you can find more

371
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,670
information but more targeted at more

372
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,320
technical people like going to slightly

373
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,930
like a what can I do for Mozilla so I'm

374
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,540
a C++ person I could do that I'm a Java

375
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,710
person I could do that

376
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,840
etc instead of getting people involved

377
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,150
in in things we are already good at like

378
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,440
we are good at organizing events

379
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,300
everywhere in the world that's all for

380
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,060
the general public with we don't need

381
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,440
the help of 90 users for that so that's

382
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,720
the things that we did in the last

383
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,930
month's was fixing the download process

384
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,720
problem fixing external communication

385
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,090
but also fixing internal communication

386
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:59,330
so this is the most important for you so

387
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:09,050
what could you do to help I'm promoting

388
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,510
it in French empowerment in English I'm

389
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,220
trying to promote it in Spanish and

390
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,270
that's the extent of my languages so if

391
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,070
you speak another language than I do

392
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,410
then the three I have mentioned please

393
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,560
promote 90 we have a blog maybe you can

394
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,590
translate the interesting blog articles

395
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,430
we have evens maybe you could organize

396
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,150
events in your in your region focused on

397
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,790
on testing bacterial gene attracting

398
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,830
like a more technical crowd people that

399
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,960
will be able to find a great regression

400
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,090
range and say that dispatched caused

401
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,780
this back that that would be really cool

402
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,780
like make some buzz around it

403
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,650
and do you have a patch in nightly so

404
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,880
that's mostly for the people that

405
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,500
already involved in Mozilla like

406
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,660
employees but also volunteers that have

407
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,210
patches in 90 talked about it on the

408
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,360
Mozilla blog like if you do something

409
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,610
interesting related to 90 I will be very

410
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,580
happy to promote your work to promote to

411
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,960
promote it through the tools that we

412
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,250
have the external ones that I mentioned

413
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,620
that blog and Twitter but also the

414
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,990
internal ones like we can put it on on

415
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,420
about home which is viewed by the lot of

416
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,390
users we can put it on what's new page

417
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,400
for your language we don't have to have

418
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,650
the same words to pitch per language we

419
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,480
can can have different information sorry

420
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,590
that was the last slide if you use it on

421
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,980
the side is great that's cool knightly

422
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,650
has telemetry activated by default that

423
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,290
sends useful information to developers

424
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,260
send your crushes but if you can please

425
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,240
use it at you as your main browser not

426
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,300
your secondary browser try to connect to

427
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,190
your bank try to use all of your

428
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,740
websites that's and tell us if it's

429
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,160
broken if a website is broken like a

430
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,420
banking site it's very important to know

431
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:18,550
triage bugs that's we get an influx of

432
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,740
like lots of bugs every day and

433
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,930
[Applause]

434
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,280
employees through triage all the bags

435
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,870
that go to exceed imagine other people

436
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,900
not comfortable with English reporting

437
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,670
reporting backs that's what the French

438
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,730
and Japanese communities do people find

439
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,870
bugs but they are not comfortable

440
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:56,830
finding bugs in English so the idea is

441
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,360
to improve the quality from the start

442
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,990
like improve the Firefox if we can

443
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,700
improve the quality of Firefox

444
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,340
significantly maybe we could do that

445
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:55,210
like is useful but it's not giving us

446
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,649
the feedback that it should we don't

447
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:58,899
have a lot of people and this on this

448
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,309
channel and most of the people that are

449
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,260
on this channel used to be 90 users so

450
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,090
basically we get the back reports but

451
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,789
six to eight weeks later so that's not

452
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:07,380
great

453
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,330
also it's promoted as a web and we get a

454
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,210
lot of reports for the dev tools but not

455
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,880
for the rest of Firefox so it's still

456
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,740
useful it's it's a stabilization step

457
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,140
but it's not as useful as we hoped it

458
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,620
would be so it's not that great

459
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,870
the second thing is that we have a lot

460
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,580
of people that want to ship faster in

461
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,140
Internet in Mozilla and it's true that

462
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,450
some things like changing the size of a

463
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,799
button in in the UI it could be faster

464
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,870
so currently what we do is that we

465
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,779
uplift a lot of things to to aura so

466
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,789
that's work for the release management

467
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,950
team to approve lots of knots and lots

468
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,010
of patches to to or and beta-2

469
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,529
to go to go faster but basically it

470
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,140
could have this code ship faster so that

471
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,140
was why this channel is not that

472
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,899
interesting if we improve the quality on

473
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:08,679
nightly we don't really need the gyro

474
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,020
channel the other thing is that we have

475
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,059
we don't have a lot of people on nightly

476
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,620
and since a lot moved to the other

477
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,780
channel we don't catch the crashes on

478
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,760
nightly that means that were is not

479
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
stable it's not as

480
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,320
as you think you are it is it's because

481
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
we didn't catch the crashes that we used

482
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,980
to catch before so if we grow the

483
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,720
community on the nightly Channel we

484
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,970
don't we don't catch them on the honor

485
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,970
so it's faster then you talked about

486
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,540
automation a lot of the crashes that we

487
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,680
have they are specific to the

488
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,990
configuration of the people graphic

489
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,390
cards antivirals Adams terms of things

490
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,960
like the metric is gigantic so

491
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,210
everything that we know we test

492
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,640
automatically but what we don't know we

493
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,640
cannot have tests for that's what we are
