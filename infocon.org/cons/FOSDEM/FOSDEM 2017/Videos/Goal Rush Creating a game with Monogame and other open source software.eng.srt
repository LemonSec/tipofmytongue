00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,869
hello Deon

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm Benjamin is Gary we are game

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,980
developers some years ago we came during

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,060
a free time which has been posed for

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,369
some years because we had good jobs on

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,289
work and we decided like two months ago

7
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,629
to put it back on the same and to

8
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,359
open-source it so that's an opportunity

9
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,670
for us to to present it to you

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,120
specifically to speak about another game

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,699
which is the base of code we use for

12
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:59,499
full game on China so this is a little

13
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:03,999
presentation for game it's a 2d arcade

14
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:09,270
game maybe you can launch the video so

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,970
let's illustrate it so it's two versus

16
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,410
two robots who plays a game like

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,440
football so basically these are some

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,090
hour an hour we've like laughing like

19
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,270
this

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,180
you have about two or three minutes to

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:53,800
beat your opponents it's a game so you

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,979
can

23
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,190
[Music]

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,600
with you

25
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,169
[Music]

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,469
[Music]

27
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,680
[Music]

28
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,138
[Music]

29
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,050
[Music]

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,749
[Music]

31
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:37,669
[Music]

32
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,780
[Applause]

33
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,849
[Music]

34
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,030
thank you we kind of mopping later

35
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:11,460
okay so the main idea is to speak a

36
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,699
little bit on how we made this game the

37
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,639
point is everything we use almost

38
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,949
everything is we use this open source

39
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,189
and we could develop the game entirely

40
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,379
on a Linux platform and also on the

41
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,360
Windows platform because I'm a Linux

42
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,580
user is more Windows user and we could

43
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,419
collaborate both the game

44
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,639
we talk Gary's will talk a little bit

45
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
later of the technical blocks we use for

46
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,889
sunshine so I'm on a game and c-sharp on

47
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,439
mono the free open source documentation

48
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:57,629
for the assets graphic you just saw we

49
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:03,419
mainly use blender even it in 2d top

50
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,159
view we wonder it we made it there

51
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,139
awareness in 3d and whether it in 2d

52
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,979
hundred several layers to after change

53
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,219
the corrosion on some settings - and

54
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:21,979
those are graphics like more

55
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,899
2d sprites art were made in game we do

56
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,990
is also the city - edits and zoomed

57
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,939
effects and music was done with Windows

58
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,539
- sequencer which is repair because add

59
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,689
back in the time like four years ago

60
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,999
alder was not as good as today and was

61
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,409
garden either so but it worked really

62
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:55,009
really well with wine and it's pretty

63
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,119
cool to not be stuck and just stuck in

64
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,059
wanted to use only and polish

65
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,300
open-source solutions when you can

66
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,330
finally go further use popularity

67
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:20,089
software's when needed I will also speak

68
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,699
about more than developing the game from

69
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,819
how you can make an app as a game with

70
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,879
open-source tools on also publish again

71
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,759
if you want under person and open source

72
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,580
game and you can use the way you you

73
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,670
will use it if you

74
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,820
as you do a traditional any game like

75
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,450
you can publish you build on Steam if

76
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,890
you want to go to the mainstream

77
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,060
solution and keep it open source - and

78
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,150
your own github just maybe take care of

79
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,870
the license if you wish you use code or

80
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,230
art in creative comments for example

81
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,380
just take care there is no restriction

82
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,960
and commercial uses you can also use

83
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,950
like more indie like platform like each

84
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,550
but I actually use a game is we just

85
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,390
finish a game you need a new bundle

86
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,790
which has there are three options it's

87
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,640
less common that opens to specific

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,740
distribution like from a games for

89
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,539
example of store like web page with many

90
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,850
open source games if you need to

91
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,890
monetize your game even if it's open

92
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,490
source you still can with a traditional

93
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,790
donation button with a Kickstarter or

94
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,470
you will or something like this if you

95
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,500
need to raise funds to implement new

96
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,030
features or even to just make the build

97
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,830
they like in the store and keep the

98
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,780
source free someone want to compile it

99
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,930
by himself

100
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,520
okay so no we will speak of the reason

101
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,650
on why we opens of the game because it

102
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,530
was not at the beginning something we

103
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,350
just wrote about it came after some

104
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,030
reflection we add because at the

105
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,040
beginning mana games was free and

106
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,830
happened to support of XNA so the

107
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,880
Microsoft framework some tools to to

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,780
build game for Xbox and Xbox Live so

109
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,299
[Music]

110
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,230
said I was used to work with open source

111
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,750
tool in Linux so it was finally quiet

112
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,440
logic that's a game itself just come

113
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,840
upon us - we know the game is not quite

114
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
finished and we could add many more

115
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,610
features but we do not have time and we

116
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,950
have another project to work on so we

117
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,710
feel that community could also if they

118
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,460
want like it to implement new things

119
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,840
yeah because we on especially Gary what

120
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,450
a game engine built on many games and

121
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,590
there is no not so many 3d game engine

122
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,980
multi-platform available so could be

123
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,610
cool to people to just dig in it in the

124
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,290
source code everyone's finally because

125
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,460
we wanted to have a voice to make

126
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,200
manifest and promotes

127
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,130
Motors fancy a more open May didn't open

128
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,960
mind where to develop two things about

129
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,920
thing and just - yes tell people that

130
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,980
sharing it's a benefit for everyone in

131
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:32,800
society so that's why so often to Gary

132
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:58,750
to speak about game engine so the game

133
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,650
is made with money game with which is

134
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,720
open-source project which was

135
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,079
the goal was to replace XNA which was

136
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,029
made by Microsoft ten years ago

137
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,279
it's C shop game development frame

138
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,059
framework that in the beginning was for

139
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:28,399
Windows and Xbox 360 it is one of the

140
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,949
platform that kick-started the

141
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:33,989
interpolant game I think because it was

142
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:37,470
before unity and it was at a time when

143
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,819
games like braid Castle Crashers in like

144
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:48,029
this started emerging sermon again use

145
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:55,410
mono to run a C shop on any platforms so

146
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,480
we have a quick list of platform you can

147
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,579
use some games we have used in the game

148
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,240
so why I'm in the game xni is a really

149
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,750
really good solution it's really a basic

150
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,600
layer it's not a game engine so it's

151
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,610
take care of every complicated stuff

152
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,060
like direct expose sound every low level

153
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,980
programming is taking care of

154
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,420
so we're free to build on that and

155
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,110
because XNA is quite old for games game

156
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,990
development time it has a lot of history

157
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,780
and a good community and many liberties

158
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,140
have been treated for the tit for XLI

159
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,140
and money games there is a few game

160
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,380
engines libris for anything can speak of

161
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:02,700
physics asset loading sound input and

162
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,580
because it's fish up its share many

163
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,940
project with unity and many asset but

164
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,190
that were built for unity have been

165
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,710
ported will in some way or another

166
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:26,270
through minigame and why we use it

167
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:32,130
whatever fits much energy is proprietary

168
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,290
software and it's a thief aside it's a

169
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,720
closed box so when something is not

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
working for you or are not working at

171
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,810
all you can do anything and it's a

172
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,330
problem and there is lot of libraries

173
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,000
for unity but because they have a asset

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,510
store where you can pay for software

175
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,610
it's not as easy to to get what you need

176
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,510
and also for some historical reason we

177
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,880
started using the XNA games back in the

178
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,960
day I was a student and when again was

179
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,310
real easy to transition to open-source

180
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,310
code

181
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,150
so we would custom game engine on top of

182
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,330
minigame and because when the game is a

183
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,740
non opinion and opinionated which mean

184
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,510
it doesn't makes everything for you it

185
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,580
just provides functionality but you

186
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,640
don't have to do things in this way so

187
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,000
it's really easy to add some features on

188
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,810
it and you don't have to write a full

189
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,190
engine you just need to write what you

190
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,830
need like a creation and management of

191
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,340
game objects some in fruit or debugging

192
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,620
and that's it you can call it an engine

193
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,800
and because I have lots of open-source

194
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,440
libraries it was easy to mix and match

195
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,120
and use source code from everywhere so

196
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,710
it was easy to implement things like

197
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,720
take big datasets with you are passing

198
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,730
assets are at run times if you want to

199
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,920
try in texture you don't have to resume

200
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
and reload the good world game and we

201
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,460
use so other meta tools for remote data

202
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,110
viewing and editing at runtime which

203
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,700
can be seen

204
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,570
[Music]

205
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,260
there

206
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,550
I just

207
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,150
so this is the tough for another game

208
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,850
but you can have this little tool that

209
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,310
will interface from network to the game

210
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,280
and you can have feedback on variables

211
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,690
and you can input data change variables

212
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,780
so it's something very valuable from

213
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,339
quick iterations and quick game

214
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,669
development

215
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,490
yes it's some of the technology we use

216
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,900
for the game so money game can use both

217
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,020
direct except in GL for graphics but we

218
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,490
targeted the only OpenGL we use also

219
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,780
open air and OGG Vorbis for the

220
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,210
ultrasound Lua is used for text assets

221
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,260
and we have a very good physical gene

222
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,120
name Farseer which was made for XNA like

223
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,429
about ten years ago and still very good

224
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:45,320
and it's Phoenix so it's Benjamin yes do

225
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,450
we use any specific Linux distribution

226
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,550
like Ubuntu creative suit to studio no I

227
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,740
did juice

228
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,420
yes mind which is based on Ubuntu and I

229
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,650
don't notice the cakes to do packages

230
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,320
which provides more than I need to do

231
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,620
everywhere within this game but I think

232
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,740
he wanted to do cooled also much raw

233
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,280
needs I tried it back in the time

234
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,429
yes it was pretty cool but ice I prefer

235
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,419
the cakes it's more up-to-date no no

236
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,570
today wouldn't studio is my I guess so

237
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:44,360
quite bit outdated and some some of us

238
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,870
how long time it took

239
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,620
so the game started like about five

240
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,250
years ago and then we got what to do so

241
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,029
it was put on the back burner and then

242
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,240
yeah recently we got the time to finish

243
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,159
it and give it a proper breathe so but

244
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,889
most but everything was done five years

245
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,279
ago

246
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,760
yes is there a way to play multiplayer a

247
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,770
single together like by using the

248
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,220
keyboard because I miss these times like

249
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,930
20 years ago when you're working for so

250
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,930
the question is is there a way to play

251
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,059
the game with only the keyboard and the

252
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:38,690
gamepad and no we don't maybe shoot but

253
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,309
the problem with keyboard if you have a

254
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:43,460
limited input you can press then keys at

255
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,650
the same time and we are we did again

256
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,570
thinking about all the they call the

257
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,630
coach games couch games just sit on the

258
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,280
couch who grabbed pad and play

259
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,240
it's Christian

260
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,800
the question is because again were

261
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,170
started a long time ago would we do

262
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,140
anything differently I did anything

263
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,840
change

264
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,140
no I will do exactly the same thing when

265
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,580
the game is still very active still

266
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,950
implementing new platforms like the PS

267
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,600
PS first report was a result during our

268
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,290
poll the community is still there and

269
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,060
mana game is still good and unity'

270
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,360
didn't change much in the meantime we

271
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,390
have a new shiny renderer

272
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,030
bit.you wire from society but I would

273
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,820
say that's about it and so but I think

274
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,400
it's the best way to do to have your eye

275
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,650
on the code still mana game is still a

276
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,190
good solution

277
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,529
is there any of a good engine other than

278
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,799
unity and minigame but stuff one well if

279
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,909
you look and I'm game that are really

280
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,460
like on Steam or anywhere and you see

281
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,499
that many many games use energy and

282
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,779
apart from that you see people using

283
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,309
game maker with really good wizard and

284
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:47,570
couldn't make a again game maker is

285
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,119
interesting because you don't have to

286
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,200
give to dig too deep into a code so if

287
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,080
you're not a programmer about trade you

288
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,610
can use it again maker with good wizard

289
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,909
and there is many other engines I

290
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,039
account name them all I know there will

291
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,119
be a talk about good engine where is

292
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,299
love which is person you are which has

293
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,360
lots of good feedback you have ever

294
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,779
options

295
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,450
maybe we should stop there thank you so

296
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,430
much thank you

297
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:29,199
[Applause]
