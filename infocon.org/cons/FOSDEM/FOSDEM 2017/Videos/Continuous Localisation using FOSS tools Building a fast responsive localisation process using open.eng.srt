1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:46,999
[Applause]

3
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,300
in terms of power is down and many some

4
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,150
other things that we need to take

5
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,040
forward in terms of open source so just

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,830
a little background in terms of history

7
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,480
as an organizer

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:34,440
even in Berlin and translating an

9
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,840
open-source software basically because

10
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,930
it was the most powerful vehicle we had

11
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,210
to influence software and to change the

12
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,980
way software worked and that was a

13
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,670
critical thing to yes and I would appeal

14
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,590
by the Microsoft actually translating

15
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,420
software by read translated something

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,300
like and at the time open office network

17
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,820
looking at issues localization across

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,130
the continent and at the moment we focus

19
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,320
on kind of worldwide issues and trying

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,140
to help teams that are I think across

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,840
the world the reason why we're going to

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,030
tolls until in which we need to address

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,730
and some of the shortcomings we saw in

24
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,080
open source every tool that we developed

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,620
was trying to tackle something

26
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,790
specifically was designed because we

27
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,550
were struggling to get the tool since

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,690
the hands of local artists

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,200
they talk it's which look says quality

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,300
checks and us conversion so that was

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,690
also that how the enable roses we have a

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,190
total fatale which is an offline

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,640
translation tool and in our memo which

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
is a massive free and open source

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,120
software translation memory and my

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,490
daughter is young and now is my daughter

37
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:12,130
say it's strong as well an accidental

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,410
that my training is in mechanical

39
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,489
engineering but we've seen some of that

40
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,239
process event I'm not from the 80s for

41
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,880
the system

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,200
place and some projects are still active

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,470
it's it's a matter of getting work for

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,900
our email and translating and sending it

45
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,730
back to review sending it back to be

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,130
fixed and landing it and then a few

47
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,380
months later actually releasing but the

48
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,340
things we've changed over the years some

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,570
of the things that we saw the first

50
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,270
translation of Microsoft software into a

51
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,920
South African language would never

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,170
actually go be translated again - there

53
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,480
were mistakes and they wouldn't be fixed

54
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,490
if we just roll over to the next and

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,890
that's very much an old-school B and the

56
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,020
people that we had added in a space

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,810
where people were translating 1015 if

58
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,750
you were a very progressive organization

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,100
in probably 35 languages but the first

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,260
thing we started seeing and we we see it

61
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,238
happen even with impunity and just

62
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,670
exposing translations to to other people

63
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,110
and making a little bit divorced from

64
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,460
the actual release we see Microsoft are

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,350
they so doing language attack concepts

66
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,480
and getting that out and we see quickly

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,860
to Facebook and Twitter and doing

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,200
massive community-based vocalizations

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,760
and we're looking at things that

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
hundreds of languages so in the present

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,610
daily living yet we're looking at

72
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,080
translation processes that need to deal

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,790
with

74
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,160
languages and that's a reality we're in

75
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,560
the world's changing you having to

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
deliver rapidly you only think about

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,370
mobile and we're about to sit with

78
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,800
multiple different targets you've got

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,050
new markets 20% of the web native

80
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,340
English speakers and the rest are

81
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,780
growing all the languages of the way

82
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,020
growing in terms of multi-digit percent

83
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,570
of the year or regression Chinese

84
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,910
Spanish discounted there as well

85
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,710
English is growing but not as big as

86
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,380
these other languages and more coming on

87
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,380
board with mobile in fact that - 2013

88
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,630
was the year in which more people were

89
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,690
using mobile to access the web and we

90
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,750
need some desktops so very very dynamic

91
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,970
change and a very dynamic change in

92
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,220
environment that's kind of where we're

93
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,170
having to look at continuous

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,820
localization sitting in the open-source

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,200
space I just wanted to quickly

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,740
belleros and vocalizes and because I

97
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,760
don't think we need spend enough time

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,580
focusing on the bed they put in and why

99
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,930
we want to look into continuous

100
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,370
vocalization from that persistent often

101
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,110
localization processes are really built

102
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,680
around the developers and development

103
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:19,610
projects about advancing their language

104
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,520
and so that's some of the motivation of

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,020
why it continues localization is

106
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,880
critical because it's about how do we

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,290
make these people really really

108
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,940
effective some of the processes that

109
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,440
we've seen over the years that we want

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,480
to try look at fixing and rethink

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,270
continuous localization is part of what

112
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,380
fit asserts strange enacted if you're

113
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,030
looking at continuous vocalization as

114
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,330
things moving more quickly we feel that

115
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,920
some of the way you can approach

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,470
continues mobilisation will actually

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,639
effectively

118
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,669
so that translators

119
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,560
really focusing on would think which

120
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,819
things are more important than other

121
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,240
things providing maximum context in a

122
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,210
way of translators getting context that

123
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,310
they might not like easily do having a

124
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,409
strong focus on quality in the same way

125
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,509
that's continuous integration that

126
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:17,360
subjects having really quick processes

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
that can allow strings to be turned

128
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,810
around very very quickly and actually

129
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,969
breaking breaking the concept which I

130
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,520
think a lot of people to them string

131
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,050
increases that there's a deadline at

132
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,789
which you can't change things but

133
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,710
actually creating a system that is much

134
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,580
much more dynamic the key ideas for us

135
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,020
in terms of continuous localization

136
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,460
really try and look at reducing the

137
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,529
friction in the process so which are the

138
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,849
processes that require manual

139
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:47,949
intervention or intervention that is

140
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,479
unhelpful for the localization process

141
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,699
how do you how do you all as well

142
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,370
eliminate and reduce the cost in them

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,639
and obviously reducing and eliminating

144
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,860
manual processes because they become

145
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,520
blockers in terms of process

146
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,569
organizational memory as a critical

147
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,849
thing and reinstall much more to it in

148
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,039
terms of how do we learn and how do we

149
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,710
continue then with Anastacia translation

150
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,870
that's critical in open-source because

151
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,180
we have

152
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,240
no translators all the time the ability

153
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,130
of progress that people can see what

154
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,479
they're working on what they should be

155
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,090
working on the credible thing for me as

156
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,710
well as how and we empower the right

157
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,830
people expecting developers to make

158
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,810
comments about the strings that need to

159
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,958
translate where a translator might have

160
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,479
a much better context and an idea of her

161
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,360
language I'd rather hear empower the

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,410
translator in that context and the other

163
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,480
thing that we we see continues

164
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,149
vocalization hoping is that releasing

165
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,060
early and often so working up places

166
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,130
that allows to push languages are as

167
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,560
quickly as they're already and to do

168
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
that continually which is more

169
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,330
affectionate of the reality so it's fun

170
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,220
to quickly meet them say two things that

171
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,270
we feel that people should be doing

172
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,010
right now if you're not doing anything

173
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,279
around and continuously organization the

174
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,200
first most critical thing and we see it

175
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,660
and is that bad translations and broken

176
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,930
translations can break products so we

177
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,870
have a strong belief that translations

178
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,400
when it captures those problems earlier

179
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,530
but as a first there's nothing that you

180
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,360
send out as a product if it's

181
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,790
mistranslated in some way should be able

182
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,800
to break the product so I mean actually

183
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,150
physically breaking it did you get a

184
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,400
trace back or crushed and that happens

185
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,590
too often and we still live it we saw

186
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,420
our Guinness face internet and source

187
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,310
where we allow that to happen so we

188
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,720
break that if you are currently using

189
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,180
continuous integration and there's very

190
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,520
many people be don't do that it's kind

191
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,460
of critical that you starting to look at

192
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,920
localization being part of that caching

193
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,630
regularization related areas whether

194
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,120
it's very pages in translations that you

195
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,520
can actually automate and detect whether

196
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,990
it's extraction of strings that you

197
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,850
haven't done those kind of things need

198
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,580
to be put into your process right now

199
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,170
and I recommend people start looking at

200
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,370
to one of our tools which is the

201
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,050
translator toolkit and actually start

202
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,390
looking at how you can automate and some

203
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,710
of those in terms of the build

204
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,360
environment so that you're not actually

205
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,930
allowing and translations that break

206
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,470
products entering to enter into the

207
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,730
intangible

208
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,920
and to get out and I'm going to hand

209
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
over to Ryan he's going to take a look

210
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,190
at a much more from from a continuous

211
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,190
integration model for Johnny yeah hi so

212
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,890
we've worked with software for years

213
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,780
both waited myself and one thing we saw

214
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,930
very clearly was using continuous

215
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,360
integration techniques to improve the

216
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,520
quality of the software and speed up

217
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,860
that process and so the big question for

218
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,050
us really were can we apply those

219
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,880
processes to localization and I think a

220
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,140
similar question really that we've asked

221
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,360
is are there any processes in

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,570
localization specific to that could also

223
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,850
assist in terms of continuous into

224
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:20,630
integration and localization so within

225
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:29,100
so within them so within the

226
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,840
localization obviously we have quality

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,150
checks and as Ben mentioned just

228
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,920
previously the translator toolkit

229
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,080
provides many subjects

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,300
I think the IP ultimate aim is to

231
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,310
prevent the strings that were reaching

232
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,900
the build process so that they don't

233
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,720
break built and they don't break the

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,120
build product but I think with a

235
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,490
continuous entire integration it's not

236
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,800
just about fixing bugs it's about taking

237
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,630
the process so it's about stepping back

238
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,390
and saying you know what was the cause

239
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,250
of that bug and putting in place the

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,260
process to prevent that and then even

241
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,090
further taking a further step back and

242
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,250
saying what causes that class of bugs

243
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,380
and how can we prevent those that class

244
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,760
of bugs from happening within

245
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,850
localization is obviously already

246
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,770
the quality checks without also provides

247
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,930
metrics it's not simply about whether or

248
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,720
not bill can pass or fail it's also

249
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,330
about whether or not the developers and

250
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,270
localizers have sight have changed in

251
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,410
the in the process so I think one of the

252
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,640
things we've been really looking at

253
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,820
recently is really two different sets of

254
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,730
checks and if we use kip-up I think

255
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,700
other repositories have similar

256
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,410
mechanisms but it can show you basically

257
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,810
if your your continuous integration

258
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,050
tests are failing or other metrics about

259
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,510
any changes that you're proposing and

260
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,190
really what we'd like to do is to have

261
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,020
something similar so when developers

262
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,510
make commits to the branch they can see

263
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,520
this is added so many strings the

264
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,470
translators can can see the first things

265
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,630
have been added straight away and then

266
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,850
on the flip side where the translations

267
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,020
are being committed to the repository

268
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,970
the checks that are currently happening

269
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,240
in the translation environment could

270
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,980
also potentially be happening about that

271
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:20,420
point of change so another key aspect is

272
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,670
improving the communication for

273
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,800
localizers one of the most challenging

274
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,870
parts of their job is really getting the

275
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,470
context of what that string is used for

276
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,790
the same string obviously the same words

277
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,470
could meet quite different things in

278
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,720
different contexts so for translators

279
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,670
that takes up a large amount of their

280
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,580
time trying to get the context to give

281
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,520
an appropriate translation so one thing

282
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,960
we'd really like to look at is how we

283
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,630
can

284
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,430
that communications blow between the

285
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,460
developers at they're conversing back

286
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,370
from the developers to the translators

287
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,230
but there's also a lot within a language

288
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,620
team that that could be improved the

289
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,100
kind of checks that people develop quite

290
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,810
often specific to their language but

291
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,220
quite often they're not and they they

292
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,620
work with other languages as well so

293
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,760
really what we're looking at is how we

294
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
can increase communication within

295
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,050
language teams between language recedes

296
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,350
and with language teams of developers so

297
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,420
just taking a quick step back 10 15

298
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,520
years ago developing software if a

299
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,350
project was forked it was really seen as

300
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,790
the absolute worst thing that could

301
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,920
happen to the project pretty much the

302
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,590
death knell of a project and github came

303
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,870
along and basically started encouraging

304
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,610
people to talk and they kind of put this

305
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,770
ribbon on people put this ribbon on the

306
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,630
website saying you don't me on

307
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,660
github and that really changed the way

308
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,950
in which people saw software for

309
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,540
nowadays most projects will look on

310
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,250
their github page or what have you and

311
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,500
they'll regarded as a success metric

312
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,330
that more people are walking their

313
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,280
software quite quite the opposite is

314
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
what happened in the past in part that

315
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,900
changes come about just because of

316
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,450
distributed virtually it allows you to

317
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,720
have local branches more easily push

318
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,270
changes between those local branches but

319
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,730
also have a shared upstream or even

320
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,360
potentially multiple shared upstream but

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,710
I think the real change came not with

322
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,750
this to beauty firstly it came with the

323
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,370
pull request because the pull request

324
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,400
allows you to not only fork but offer

325
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,620
those changes back in to make it very

326
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,720
clear what changes you were offering

327
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,230
back to the

328
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,370
right so I think localization to adopt

329
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,040
some of those practices really the area

330
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,110
that we're looking at right now is how

331
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,180
we clean how we can branch and how we

332
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,460
can how we can do and how we can merge

333
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,500
those changes back how we can apply that

334
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,260
very successful process from software

335
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:00,230
into the localization process so I've

336
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,910
been weekly developers Oakland I know

337
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,710
that others are looking at similar

338
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,540
technologies I think a pretty critical

339
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,060
parts making it frictionless is that VCS

340
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,070
hook up - as soon as developers are

341
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,630
committing strings they're appearing in

342
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,610
whatever tool that you used to localize

343
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,880
and conversely as soon as you're making

344
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,500
changes or soon after you're making

345
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,780
changes to your localization those are

346
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,160
appearing back in there in the

347
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,970
repository pootle started out mostly as

348
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,060
a file-based editor and even now keep a

349
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,190
very large complex projects tend to have

350
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,880
a very far ways of localization and one

351
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,200
of the things that we're moving towards

352
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,750
as much more seeing localization as a

353
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,700
data source so we can work not just with

354
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,950
profiles what have you but directly with

355
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,810
databases or potentially even with

356
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,750
websites or other sources of

357
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,000
localization so as I said before

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,030
previously we work mostly with poem

359
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,270
nowadays the localization landscapers

360
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,640
drastically changed and even within a

361
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,010
single project you like to see more than

362
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,020
one localization format so that's what

363
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,609
that's a pretty critical aspect being

364
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,829
able to integrate with those projects is

365
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,290
being able to work with the variety of

366
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,460
formats they work with

367
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,589
so there's a there are some technologies

368
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,270
that are quite specific to localization

369
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,829
in a pretty relevant in terms of

370
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,720
building that organizational memory

371
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,429
I think translation memory being

372
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,179
probably the most obvious one for those

373
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:31,010
who aren't aware it allows us to see how

374
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,260
a swing was translated previously it

375
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,420
gives you some prompts in how you might

376
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,299
translate it the other one that's a

377
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,330
pretty significant aspect and

378
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,570
increasingly so is machine translation

379
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,500
historically received translation has

380
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,260
been pretty cool that's changing pretty

381
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,169
quickly but it's also useful as an aid

382
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,360
to speed up that localization process

383
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,370
even if it doesn't give you a perfect

384
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,809
string it can give you some pretty good

385
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,150
problems so just finishing up just

386
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,419
within translate house how main go on

387
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,630
around this is support more freely sort

388
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,510
of projects we're very much from there's

389
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,419
free and open source world and I think

390
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,429
for most of the now organization that

391
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,280
that's our our main aim is to see as

392
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,100
much open source software localized in

393
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,419
as many languages as possible but we'd

394
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,549
like to make localization in Germany I

395
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,260
mean walking around conference talking

396
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,620
to people even now many many big

397
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,510
projects just don't localize their

398
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,490
software and I think nowadays the

399
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,380
technology is there that makes it a lot

400
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,960
easier and the Internet has meant that

401
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,610
the market is so much greater this is

402
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,730
the need to do that is so much more so

403
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,260
fine I think just the same we're looking

404
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,330
for any while we're always looking for

405
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,100
localizers but we're also looking for

406
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,370
coders it might have a passion around

407
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,500
localization or you know widening

408
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,110
participation in the internet and the

409
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,770
web more generally so any any questions

410
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,740
hi so if you plan to use like a unified

411
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,510
the storage system for localization how

412
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,390
would you put it together given that

413
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,030
different localization formats have

414
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,000
different feature sets so some may have

415
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,040
laurels and may not have Toros some may

416
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,830
like al dente around and so lot of extra

417
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,770
features hold you that unified storage

418
00:19:51,770 --> 00:20:01,940
model I'll sing a specifically in terms

419
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,760
of 3 2 and currently purchase to use an

420
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,590
internal representation that's pretty

421
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,840
much like poem which gives it some

422
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,970
limitations but oppose a pretty robust

423
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,370
format so you can express most of the

424
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,910
other formats in that way but I would

425
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,380
say I mean for us the answer to that

426
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,270
question is always where we bring

427
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,340
localizations from different projects

428
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,960
from different formats and we put them

429
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,000
into one place where localized in season

430
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,970
the camera the different we don't really

431
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,640
want to see how the layout or the

432
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,590
formatting change we want to see the

433
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,620
contents during the change that's really

434
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,620
what we're wanting to see different in

435
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,120
terms of the differences that are coming

436
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,989
from different bases

437
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,080
talking talking about teens and building

438
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,230
up with localizations and what would you

439
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,070
suggest

440
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,769
there's someone showing up with a rare

441
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,950
language that's not in the local

442
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,940
database no Jim it sees or anything so a

443
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,639
new language do you do you recommend

444
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:39,700
they will start to say in the pool

445
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,809
profiles or go to the to the source

446
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:58,779
first so that they get support for my

447
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,999
question is to see even the smallest

448
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,379
language active and activated on a Linux

449
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,149
system not have any teeth lips either

450
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:09,399
Carol can be a bit of a barrier but a

451
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:15,700
lot of a lot of places it isn't well we

452
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,799
in the kind of African countries we

453
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,749
tackled the missing locale problem by

454
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:26,049
just making it go away and I would

455
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,549
encourage someone like that to look at

456
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,190
building in a cow I haven't looked at it

457
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,779
for a while whether they seal the

458
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,029
alligator is called direct you can see

459
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,159
that it couldn't be the most effective

460
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,769
way of actually doing they're not very

461
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,149
hard to do

462
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,940
in English documented at all but my

463
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,380
thing would be I think the critical

464
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,570
takeaway for me is I don't like seeing

465
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,370
any barriers prevent someone so I'd

466
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,470
rather help someone like their

467
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,460
technology let's see their power thing

468
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,930
because it'll go away once that's done

469
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,940
it's literally garden and they for you

470
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,510
to carry on

471
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,410
[Music]

472
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,440
I've worked together with asteroid OS

473
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,170
team two minutes translations there and

474
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,940
one of the troubles we were running into

475
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,510
is that we have the applications which

476
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,700
are all cutesy so we have the cutes

477
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,830
translation system for all the strings

478
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,260
in the application and then we have the

479
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,740
daesil files which which contain a half

480
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,570
name that also needs to be translated

481
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,450
we're currently using web late for that

482
00:23:40,450 --> 00:24:15,150
but we can only translate - yeah yeah

483
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,710
yeah which might be an approach because

484
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,150
I'm pretty sure then you could translate

485
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,000
her the other format okay thanks

486
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,700
you were talking about quality of

487
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
translation earlier what's your process

488
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,930
Church or that you have good quality

489
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,760
translations because presumably

490
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,300
different translators will in this

491
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,130
ignite which would have different will

492
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,230
say differently especially when you're

493
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,910
dealing with volunteer translators the

494
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,320
metrics that I'm looking at is making

495
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,280
sure that you've got anything on the

496
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,140
maturity of the language and looking

497
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,140
that you've got the resources that then

498
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,600
enhance translations so well defined

499
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
terminology followed by a translation

500
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,220
memory better be consistency the thing

501
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,960
that we want to see language language

502
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,090
team specifically do is actually build

503
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,540
quality metric tests that can actually

504
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,400
ensure that but the critical thing we've

505
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,560
found is that actually for translation

506
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,360
memory is to give you consistent

507
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,740
terminology that it relates to the

508
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,360
domain and they're translating and

509
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,850
that's the kind of first step of getting

510
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,899
of getting at consistency

511
00:26:36,510 --> 00:27:12,090
as a French English because I think

512
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,030
there are few approaches one is to

513
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,500
physically place them in some places the

514
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,910
problem with that is that you end up

515
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,550
with very difficult to understand

516
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,020
translations so my first thing would be

517
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,179
actually looking at how you can adapt

518
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,710
the UI that's a possibility in terms of

519
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,720
screenshots and that we've been toying

520
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,580
with a bit of those ideas and thinking

521
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,840
what we could do there the difficult

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,220
with screenshots is trying to figure out

523
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,800
how you could automate that a bit so

524
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,990
that you you can see when things

525
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:41,780
okay enough questions keep your head up

526
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,110
Thanks I have a question that what

527
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,630
filter data is usually available in

528
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,240
translation software it's about the

529
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:10,770
minority which say wasn't match so what

530
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,810
is the your your thoughts about the

531
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,910
censuses of terminology in order to give

532
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,500
the quality of translations I think it

533
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,670
depends a little bit was to be

534
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,120
translated last year I was in India and

535
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,130
working some government organisations

536
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,580
there and what they made is without this

537
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,830
technology even within a single language

538
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,530
again a continuously thing for me is I

539
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,780
think often terminology is is neglected

540
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,280
but it's really empowering the

541
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,650
translators a better be my passion is

542
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,890
seeing the translators actually

543
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,000
developing the terminology that applies

544
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,370
to the domain they're localizing so the

545
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,870
words they have problems with that that

546
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,840
becomes the ten dinars for that problem

547
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,260
domain

548
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,630
either you're talking about as a part of

549
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,300
continuous integration it's a good idea

550
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,970
to try to take broken strings for

551
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,820
example mm would you

552
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,309
concretely quote doesn't mean you create

553
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,809
a filter your software and then you have

554
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,520
to kind of start to help and run through

555
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,660
a bunch of fixes it's

556
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,559
Sivas the software doesn't crash for

557
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,910
example because of a you know weird

558
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,850
string or do you do screen chalking or

559
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:28,809
this kind of thing or is something a bit

560
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,490
like a pull request when something makes

561
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,500
changes you could see that

562
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:25,470
one of those you're looking at defense

563
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:44,039
the one was we call that English thing

564
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,720
this is not ideal in a UI but it's

565
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,360
better than crashing or breaking so then

566
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,049
a defense I think with the continues

567
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,519
vocalization is trying to bring Nana

568
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,559
forward so a simple one would be is even

569
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:08,370
using and you're not pushing which is

570
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,850
possible

571
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,249
and when you not necessarily get text

572
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,499
directly and then the times they talk it

573
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,029
will do things that we actually do the

574
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,059
four variables we can write test

575
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,769
variables are broken and an XML becomes

576
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,499
quite a problematic one we're especially

577
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:28,330
doing some kind of interpretation aren't

578
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,129
you expecting the XML to look a certain

579
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:33,309
way you've used names that look given it

580
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,460
be translatable by page or color and

581
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,649
people then translated so just building

582
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,479
those checks and so that they they call

583
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,519
right at the beginning and those are so

584
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,619
critical thing in build is thank you

585
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,479
and the problem with some of the water

586
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,039
main in Texas that they do need to be

587
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,440
kind of a hundred percent accurate

588
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,710
you don't one you can't really deal with

589
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,479
there's another they're not checks that

590
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:59,129
you can build to catch those right there

591
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,119
Thanks

592
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,440
keep your hands up

593
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,550
hi sort of related to the same question

594
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,219
previously so if we already have say a

595
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,949
test suite that we put the localizations

596
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,960
through when they come in back from

597
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,418
poodle or transifex or whatever we might

598
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,600
be using at the time would there be

599
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,100
would you envision some sort of

600
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,880
mechanism or protocol whereby you could

601
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,469
integrate your own systems to report

602
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,010
back to maybe portal if say that the

603
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,490
translators will will make 20 changes on

604
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,270
20 strangely and somehow magically in

605
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,980
the background creates a pull requests

606
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,480
and the source control and the CIE tools

607
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,270
will come back and report on the same

608
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,580
right these two strings here failed with

609
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,170
this error message and stuff like that

610
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,830
and would you think of some some

611
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,040
administration tools to sort of limit

612
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,010
going back and forth and like helping

613
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,240
translate things quicker

614
00:35:34,920 --> 00:36:20,579
I think like the critical place cash it

615
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,619
is right in in the tool itself that

616
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,190
would be my ideal like reporting back at

617
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,490
a later date works but it does mean that

618
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,099
the translator then is part of the loop

619
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,720
they're not on that string anymore so

620
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,780
thank you so much

621
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,719
[Applause]
