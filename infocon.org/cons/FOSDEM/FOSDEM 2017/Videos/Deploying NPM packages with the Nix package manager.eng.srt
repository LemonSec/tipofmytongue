sander van

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,340
 per transfer at the queen pmh pictures to pin it actually melts

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,019
 ok thank you for the introduction so this presentation will be but something

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,660
 that i've been working and dressing changed to earth and this products

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,239
 syntax lisan tingri like that much doing so xlii and then the reason why and

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,560
 during this and at basically no king de npm there nothing integration

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,440
 cost lot you can do lots of cool links so with the members for

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,470
 a start my presentation how many of you leopard or the nothing package manager

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:50,180
 nothing like it search the wider view so nothing developer since 2007 and using it

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,980
 in my daily work as both my home computers and pretty much everything

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:02,750
 hells hike win then and the purpose of the nothing fekkes managers this knee the

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
 the nothing project is the family of deployment tools and what they all of

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,249
 income is that they support declared of deployment so the ideas you might what you

14
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:17,240
 lives in the the clash between the clare te specification and forms of single

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,189
 spécifications your car native feel the fold and process and the bases 17 is the

16
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,630
 nothing package manager at your father's approach x is seems like nothing oh he

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,350
 switches and linux distribution builder space concept

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,130
 has developed hijdra that she is continuous integration server image to the cenk

19
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,289
 us apps who is nothing that will be so product details

20
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,819
 cando dixons since 2001 you can turn the engine

21
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,719
 distributed systems consisting of microsoft office or other web services

22
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,609
 and deploy the mats with i not your network and so if nothing on switch i

23
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,469
 can use to deploy a network or nothing like machines in the cloud sets amazon

24
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,889
 easy to

25
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,000
 so besides autometer deployment the tools in an ex product like seven

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,610
 numbers interesting non non functional properties' as we are wrong this is already the

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,350
 nothing solutions ar jean-eric solutions so that nothing it student willy mather what

28
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,910
 technology here is the right siep also in line with cyprus plus program line it

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,840
 beg files' pearl stays and ruby ​​java

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,989
 it student mm you can they nothing package manager for all those

31
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,890
 technologically as any other proper import and property

32
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,720
 or the nothing package minute manager is reproducible deployment that's how nothing becomes

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,769
 trice de do something tries to height and many in pure artist het wild

34
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,900
 potentially in filling package image and sponge bulb and that typically queensbed

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,310
 has the inputs about certain image so there are that the 1000 mm where you

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,010
 distorted image the image felis loved so angry will be a

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,989
 other property of the nothing product is flyball deployment so in order to

38
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,560
 support for life' book that fold people nothing for shampoo and church that the

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,549
 penny's your zoal is complete and also offer sphinx like

40
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,230
 everything of course upgrades and robex

41
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,570
 and that's zinc that nothing tries to do with it tries to be

42
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,540
 efficient in the sense that i do and that carries out the activities that i do nothing

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,100
 to do and nothing more time to make deployment process and that a necessary

44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,370
 long

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,070
 this is your sample t acquaintances product in an x ​​product seems nothing ms has you

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,320
 because is nothing osn you might be this is this is the typical workflow zo

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,500
 luxury bid what can per conventional service solution 10

48
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,470
 solutions what you do nothing that's how you profit

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,740
 decleir the specification and whether your machine stretcher

50
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,880
 so many times sample this configuration in this light coat public send my my

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,269
 laptops coffee quraysh a solid describe things like

52
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,020
 he want the three hours back bootloader he want use this

53
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,340
 die style system partition from views die schop partitions and ze system

54
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,300
 server side on tour in open asses age 5 for die i sir permit decay die

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,900
 for desktop it can also provide all the end-user

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,710
 packages detail warms up bits 5 the firefox web browser in the with my

57
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,459
 commander and what you then typically shower their one

58
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,880
 single could it line instruction nothing lesson for your image switch force on

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,840
 top and what happens is nothing orangery image switch a lot deploy the entire

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,890
 maybe configure center rush if I want on t and all the necessary

61
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,570
 dependency nails sit want image and fortress of sjors coat worth a freak

62
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,430
 the walloon generate also considération at home and those and two will so yeah

63
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,240
 permit system with all your sust and service in share desktop from everything

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,270
 has that you won't commercial and as a do you can change

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,570
 this your specific you will find this on it

66
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,599
 is' ​​and is you we nothing ms reed switch gramm

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,400
 and the upgradeable hiss and then looked like toilets so nothing will never blow over

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,510
 anything would you can anything for samples your brake assist a switch back to any

69
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,830
 letter is configuration and that as a kind of samples ainsi que si in the group

70
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,109
 bootloader your whole issue

71
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,680
 call dead speakers for example if i ok de system used for temple system die

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,490
 term assistant service and did not stop the bie and who starts it and then you

73
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,560
 silent on server bit of downtime and yes system services there a available for

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,810
 well so for me strong pointer view your system is upgrade show clean what

75
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,840
 discussion still need to change things get real time

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,969
 yes so you lift a lot of side effects on server and that prevented from that intro

77
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,680
 which yes of course so this is what I want or pencils looks

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,699
 like yourself your blood nothing was at the falls in butcher lengths configuration with

79
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,300
 already priv is configuration and put you have garbage collector jets you can if they

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,830
 picked up so realized it great for his pol embarrasses you with display that mordicus

81
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,270
 by display driver broke you just had a cup of coffee and used

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,710
 and your saved game zo the critters or the nothing project and all it

83
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,008
 juice product is the nothing package manager like that has an i specs manager

84
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,669
 section that the bacon the organization metz luxe pitch gary and figuratively in

85
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,938
 this light and is carey partner spokesmen filenames

86
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,949
 zo de the nothing package manager storz everything in the so cult nothing thorin

87
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:29,370
 eye foundation and that you can see the first first component or the over the of

88
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,870
 or something place is a hash coach and who the stays the heathcote of all in follows

89
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,180
 want time the talent system image the place it so for sample the source code

90
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,750
 versions of the compiler sninkers the image scripps

91
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,680
 all who spoke who will reflect it in the house and I would I become often sample page

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,479
 i seek to a new fashion and he needs companion firefox ibm i want on here

93
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,688
 this point heathcote and that cash register free pack it would be esprit fix and unique

94
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,539
 take you can choose that storm blood test there a cils

95
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,349
 mary packages 17 next to each other death and interference

96
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,020
 but to come up with nothing package manager

97
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,560
 the nothing package manager looks like nothing all this tutorial done it is so

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,470
 the users can do nothing like this expression piece part viewers of sjors coat and is the

99
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,600
 pantyhose and in this light is nothing passion is used to compile open and she sure of

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,720
 sjors buys and is the tennant's is so in nothing expansion for simple the

101
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,710
 expression shown in this light is basically function and definition in in the

102
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,630
 purely functional programming language and the first line is basically the function

103
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,340
 an argument soviets and chen and decors points de te de bilt end tennessee put

104
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,719
 that you don't pockets the images so the first your argument de the std en

105
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,340
 so they voted it unix and violent providing come unix and tailpiece like

106
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,190
 at and ls and with fetch if something that can be used to download is dirty from

107
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,110
 remote locations and open ssl and put lipari quiet life reed pen cissé of

108
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,730
 also a swedish and what we do in the body is week already and make their passion

109
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,330
 function that's basically the nothing way of saying he because the image santing of

110
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,719
 sjors coach hyperlite with the details predators

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,919
 like to take fashion i download the the open they sick

112
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,510
 star bol of the open ssl server and what we do in the body is your provider number

113
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,740
 or image instructions the image is open and always from sjors cold so open and she

114
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,309
 sure users a car tools like per image

115
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,809
 serving door so this prince could make point arden tarball and their figure

116
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,260
 install'

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,080
 so at home was practical issues which this expansion to this expression these can

118
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,850
 describes how to build effect of source code a student cissé with who like it

119
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,000
 word sample not one oh which version of set mid to the ones you some which

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,770
 version of open and she so that sex not then in the sec the expression so the first

121
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,310
 expansion here is basically function and definition that you don't put it in focus

122
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,390
 function with function argument so turns on discus retire free sample

123
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,699
 is an import but expansion and letters slight a nas functions and parameters

124
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,030
 that perfect image time puts the pantyhose he lives you sit here that moment so that not

125
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,180
 a specific version or open ssl a specific version or set 0

126
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,319
 and when she opens all those packages ssl put member carried a living

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,090
 surgery and compost in the similar way and if you were to run for simple de

128
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,940
 came the lines instruction and disco me this

129
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,200
 this instruction here is it wants to do is I want to image all the image to the

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,430
 tights first and then the packet itself and that entry will be zult

131
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,280
 and I open the pest correspondent or and she is sharing something

132
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,330
 so using hash coach to isolate packet you always

133
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,400
 lost nys that in cosine is if you and end user and you live before your start

134
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,939
 sample firefox in stop at nothing there is no way you can remember

135
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,250
 heathcote so now not such a can your neck and is an image by making space

136
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,220
 packages more accessible zo for this nothing he introduces the concept

137
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,260
 of user and science so the idea is in view as an end user

138
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,450
 entry goodies what happens is it composé use and fire with if you can

139
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,020
 see in the top and that's basically your sim shines who's basically

140
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,610
 synthesizing the content will access the packets hjoed simplex friso dat die

141
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,760
 chance accessible for man single the location

142
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,750
 and then you will be them limburg in directions something like that time you instant

143
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,170
 software so a generations in link create that

144
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,640
 refers to war user environment and so as also us in link return to work

145
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,689
 you a set of entry-level treats and adding the location to that

146
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,500
 symbolism in the us aspects of you are variable is marriage sample

147
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,940
 time firefox from the command-line the coast this the interactive types here die

148
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,080
 being five with your kid starts firefox that's how numbers in directions become weekend

149
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,290

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,870
 software becomes the bar node.js is here anyone using node.js slack

211
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,390
 so evil view so it becomes happy worrying or so is the best best of both

212
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,360
 worlds right so the us know ts becomes vlc at the same

216
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:06,730
 dutch and testing yes yes yes yes and that paint a different products

217
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,320
 budget most people using npm so this video with your spaces what diploma it nt

218
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,550
 msnp and is the image add something will she we the pen that team manager and that actually

219
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,240
 conflict is nothing wrong with the penny's management features

220
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,500
 and if such a nothing keynes all the potential benefit from the gray het

221
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,060
 real words girls see the pens management and not good is your good

222
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,359
 bypass that's there then there's no point in using

223
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,930
 this is basically keep you should normally an eye catcher most of you could be

224
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,349
 your daddy know sports center you will be the cell with project your tip i do now is you

225
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,250
 provider package is a file that might look like this

226
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,400
 your prophecies at adt en foot sample your provider the penis is that you once because

227
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,810
 you then get through the jury and tea and in sales command line and it becomes mp en

228
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,140
 so it's all about the knowledge and brushing into the emergency folders of the same

229
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,380
 product

230
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,420
 now how can i share this is conflict de solutions actually quite simple

231
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,010
 formation kettle loses strength is dresses substitute the conflicts too

232
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,819
 manage manager at do this penises manage yourself in

233
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,800
 the nothing environment and if you some of vette de pen so den itself first

234
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,050
 distress and peanuts and find you in stop noor

235
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,700
 writers songs free sample so basically you can target something

236
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,030
 like this right would this is that mp and install' instruction in detail winning

237
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,629
 nothing expression and before that he somehow

238
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,820
 on toe and kill the penny they are because go there in the midst of emergency fashionable folder

239
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,530
 what recognition hassle is if you take a closer look at this expression honor and de

240
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,399
 packers jason you see the tea capture flight similar properties so

241
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,550
 easy can just automatically generate in nothing

242
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,030
 expression

243
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,140
 so and direction appears to be quite straightforward that's it willi

244
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,820
 betz fresh forward so has the tell you xlii much more much

245
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:13,490
 much much more complicated than just at en ja door xlii many reasons for dat en

246
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,250
 the first who she is do you have the counter the fok sample the pack jason dokumentation

247
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,830
 den de then you seen at nps medication or the pen and cheese for sample it it

248
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,730
 concept of the pens she bark minutes their garden the pens cissé

249
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:36,210
 with all so there is this notion or the field with the tights i am strong slow motion

250
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,500
 control their time the pins in the picture and the penis is in the sense that you just

251
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,980
 perfect the pens sea store builder and finance in the images [ __ ] figure out

252
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,820
 becomes the target

253
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,360
 npm as as peer detention' always busy glands stan they conflict resolution

254
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,090
 mechanism becomes that mp and archers don't seem to load him even whats the

255
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,840
 pose dominicus in older versions peer the penny's is red as

256
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,149
 set automatically will be later details this behavior to carrier check

257
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,740
 every six to buy ted difference in a generating and expression for temple

258
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,620
 and when it's off point on the tights so bundles knowledge is so busy 3

259
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,330
 note modules already in the packers that you then have permissions I know and if which

260
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,270
 supports on optional the tights in the sense that

261
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,470
 functional the tights arnoud too much and he has a lot more than the pockets insulation

262
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,380
 sale pieces something and just like there default incompatible

263
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,790
 there was nothing to fold with model is special you will call this the

264
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,399
 minister for sample picasso from network seriously to him

265
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,620
 but if i want to greater generator' what who basic that oil is your goal doel

266
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,250
 incense right counters the pennies in the field with the penis is in vs pin sequester

267
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,510
 and so who has abstract the optional the permissions and peer the penny stock

268
00:19:53,510 --> 00:20:01,640
 sample i don't have to do anything with him kissed by multiples so check this out

269
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,690
 another thing like that

270
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,430
 version number thin and pma basically semantic sweet brains so least sting

271
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,630
 consist of 2 version components charges specific opinion and various

272
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,300
 numbers but typically used to refer to package is in the and thee and registry wat

273
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,290
 you can users you can use precise version number stone refer to one specific

274
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,340
 vision in the mpm whether she put you can also use version veentjes sorry can

275
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,980
 specify things like a want the version of this practice to be one punch sharepoint

276
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,550
 one or higher or something like that the could if your stacks

277
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,570
 and text in the week lyrical or to version songs have sites and pm

278
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,750
 package the camp of the mpm which she can also use your own remote locations

279
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,440
 your channel series shirt will go through the pen so you are in your own home directory

280
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 you can refer to the cure els you can you enter your a repository is then

281
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,900
 gadget and bitburg it and she long now if i want to make a translation

282
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,000
 so in nothing bios flash coach tried dente fact packages and en mtm the username en

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,630
 the version number so how can i make a translation

284
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,810
 between these two major specify inversions

285
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,939
 and there such someone solutions for my perspective so on sample

286
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,600
 discount specific vision is easy because she know what you get film en pi en was

287
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,580
 stable diffuser version games for simple and i version higher than brandpunt ciro

288
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,699
 this became incompatible nick speakers is fox and satisfies

289
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,580
 we seemed to research the hashcode and be the least he has to download

290
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,210
 places studay my mind that person focal point shiro-an tomorrow and get

291
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,410
 version mind' point hot and he's still get so a hair shot as long as lucy je

292
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,910
 buttocks title cried so buy that oil solution this is us' snapshot

293
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,540
 basically the furchandise de ja that you won't you want to use

294
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,909
 are you a bit of a counter where so the verse was a race or to today

295
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,930
 announced at fashion and night generate and output hashcode one that's what a

296
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,400
