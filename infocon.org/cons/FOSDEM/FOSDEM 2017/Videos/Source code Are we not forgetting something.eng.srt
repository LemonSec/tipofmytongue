1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,069
so welcome to the father 2017

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,139
distribution bedroom we have who's

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,110
sleeping presenting source code are we

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,600
not forgetting something

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,180
thank you yeah

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,789
I'm a Debian developer myself but the

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,340
talk will be for relevant for any

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,480
distribution maybe also for people who

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,670
have their own upstream projects and

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,610
want to provide at our balls or whatever

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,629
for the people to use so I'm going to

12
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,750
talk about source code of course so what

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,910
is it and why do we want it I just

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,950
remind our things that we should already

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,770
know now I'll talk about different kinds

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,980
of files so when we talk about source

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,320
code we are usually thinking about

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,820
something within a programming language

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,050
like C or Python but there are many more

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,329
types of files and they all have their

21
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,960
own groups maybe hopefully I have enough

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,619
time then I can go in to the appendix at

23
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,869
the end and go through some file types

24
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,630
and more details but I will also talk

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,340
about the problems that we have with

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,200
work source code and some conclusions

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,900
that I draw from them I don't think I

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,180
have answers for all the problems but

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,630
it's just a wake-up call for some people

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,640
here hopefully so first I will talk a

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,790
little bit about what source code is you

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,830
probably all know it but sometimes you

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,080
want to have a good definition and the

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,360
one I think it's very good it's the one

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,640
from the third version of the GPL

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,979
because it's very succinct

37
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,860
so first it says that source code is a

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,540
work for the source code for our work

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,979
means the preferred form of the work for

40
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,610
modification and object codes means

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,710
anything that is derived from the source

42
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,850
work notice that here it says a work so

43
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,250
it doesn't really say specifically that

44
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,459
should be a program on executable the

45
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,549
GPL can apply on you can use it for

46
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,450
anything in principle

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,930
later on it has another remark it says

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,730
the source code for working object code

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,060
means all the source code that we need

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,390
to generate install and run or use the

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,850
object code and to modify the work and

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,540
this also includes scripts to control

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,270
all these activities so basically what a

54
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,040
what I mean here is it's not just enough

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,380
to have the source code itself because

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,500
you also need a sample compiler you need

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,910
maybe the the make files everything that

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,830
you need to produce the end result okay

59
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,920
but most of you are working on your

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,540
laptop or computer and then you're only

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,660
using the end product so why is the

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,950
source relevant

63
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,280
what happens here

64
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,120
so okay

65
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,040
sorry something goes wrong here

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,149
technology see

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,959
oh I see I'm missing a part of the

68
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,340
screen so we want the source code

69
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,950
because there are several reasons so one

70
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,370
is that we were required by the license

71
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,670
of the work to include the source code

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,840
another is that some distributions

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,940
require it and notably debian and fedora

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,140
and many of their derivatives but the

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,850
main reason why we have an open source

76
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,560
community is because you want to be able

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,260
to fix bugs and programs that we want to

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,720
add new features that we want to learn

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,620
from things so that we can make new

80
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,520
products for example so just an example

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,070
the Debian free software guidelines as

82
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,030
their second item say that every program

83
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,070
must include source code and must allow

84
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,750
distribution in the source code as well

85
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,040
as compiles form well it really says

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
program there but most of the Debian

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,580
developers they agree that this does not

88
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,770
only apply to source code it applies to

89
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,690
everything and of course as I said

90
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,700
before you also want to have all the

91
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,160
tools to be able to build the actual

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,979
actual program so Debian thinks these

93
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,950
should all be free and have their source

94
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,610
code those tools available as well so I

95
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,310
already said that one thing is that we

96
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,950
can learn from source code we can study

97
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,360
it we can fix bugs we can for example

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,590
port programs to different platforms one

99
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,110
of the great successes of Linux is that

100
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,130
it was one of the first operating

101
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,240
systems that was ported to 64-bit intel

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,460
architecture or in the architecture

103
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,490
because we just have a new version of

104
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,440
GCC which support 64-bit and we can

105
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,760
really compile everything inform the

106
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,910
source and took a bit longer for Windows

107
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:55,090
for example and noting is that if we

108
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,950
cannot do something ourselves if I'm

109
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,090
working with some program it's written

110
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,730
in Haskell I don't know Haskell it will

111
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,380
take me forever to figure out how it

112
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,150
works how to fix the bug but I can just

113
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,760
say to someone else who knows Haskell

114
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,470
here's the source code do you know what

115
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,350
is wrong and without the source code it

116
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,970
cannot show anything to anyone else so

117
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,530
so a list of file types executables

118
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,110
that's one that's a trivial one what is

119
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,090
a whole list of things so we have

120
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,830
manuals and you can think of okay

121
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,130
manuals just a piece of text but for

122
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,920
example manuals can come in a form of a

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,580
PDF file but nobody is writing the PDF

124
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,680
code directly in their text editor you

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,790
use a book or latex or something else

126
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,910
and then you compile it in a way to the

127
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:59,890
result we have markup languages CSS and

128
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,570
Glade so if you want to style your

129
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,420
website or you want to provide a user

130
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,160
interface for a program you have all

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,910
these languages that you do you can use

132
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,230
for that but sometimes you're also

133
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,840
auto-generated so for CSS you have this

134
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,580
what are the tools called what I've got

135
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,980
laid you some XML files but you have all

136
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,430
kinds of tools that can be used to

137
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,100
generate them you have translations I

138
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,450
think of well the cat text it's a very

139
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,189
funny one

140
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,090
because you have the adult profiles

141
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,599
which are the files where you actually

142
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,250
write the translation in but that is

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,169
partially auto-generated and partially

144
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,120
you edited manually and then from that

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,590
you generate the binary called the

146
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,689
ultimo file which gets installed and

147
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,539
used at runtime to provide translations

148
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,759
for your program fonts you think we have

149
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,819
TTF file true type font and doesn't get

150
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,520
contain all the nice factors to make a

151
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,800
very nice outline of the font and render

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,669
it well yeah but font designer actually

153
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,879
it doesn't just draw some lines he has

154
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,550
all kinds of guidelines and rules a

155
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,919
library of curves he uses to create a

156
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,909
systematic way of the glyphs of the font

157
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,799
you have all kinds of multimedia like

158
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:44,290
images sound music even movies databases

159
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,269
think of if you use a Stellarium for

160
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,890
example is a very nice open source

161
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,899
program to simulate a view of the night

162
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,290
sky it uses a database of star positions

163
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,269
and these were recorded by NASA for

164
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,570
example they are in a certain format but

165
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,490
they have to be pre processed before it

166
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,420
can be used so there's all these things

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,130
and some of them have source code some

168
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,630
of them are your own source if I just

169
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,440
well make an image in and you save

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,339
it as a xef that's or PNG maybe if it's

171
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,110
a single layer then that is its own

172
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,000
source you can say but if you have

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,750
something more complex like you have you

174
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,920
use Inkscape you know effector graphics

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,430
with many effects then the PNG that you

176
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,949
produce from that for example it's not

177
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,949
really a source again the source is the

178
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,829
preferred form of quantification that's

179
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,130
another issue because sometimes it's not

180
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,059
really clear what

181
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,469
preferred form is hopefully I will get

182
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:59,779
to that later but I have to go through

183
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,959
all the slides so this is a list of

184
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,249
problems so that the header was cut off

185
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,379
that you can have source code so what I

186
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,149
said it's not payable to preferred form

187
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,479
is sometimes it's too big

188
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,839
so for distributions we only have so

189
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,599
much space on our the mirrors that host

190
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:25,099
our packages blender as a competition

191
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,619
where people can make movies or they

192
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:30,529
diskette sponsors and they make them

193
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,589
these movies well if you download the

194
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,819
end result it's maybe a few hundred

195
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:37,519
megabytes that's already quite large but

196
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,529
all the sources used to produce that

197
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,389
movie Wow that's multiple gigabytes so

198
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,469
distributions cannot for example ship

199
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:49,549
this sometimes it also takes too much

200
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,189
CPU power to to compile something again

201
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,629
these movies they have to be rendered

202
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,489
for example they you need a compiled

203
00:10:55,489 --> 00:11:00,379
form and weeks of CPU time to to

204
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,609
actually produce the end result

205
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:07,309
sometimes the the compiler or effort we

206
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:09,679
used to go from source code to object

207
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,999
form is non-free sometimes you have

208
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,249
people who wrote something and then they

209
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:19,519
lost the source code and so you only

210
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,449
have the end result what do you do then

211
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,979
the agenda foods just throw it away and

212
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,919
say no we only accept things that are

213
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,079
that have their source code but

214
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,109
sometimes it's so useful and it was free

215
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,719
in a way so what do you do with this you

216
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,969
have issues where sometimes the author

217
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:45,249
says oh here I have something is GPL and

218
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,409
I throw it on some FTP server and it's

219
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,269
out of my hands and then somebody asked

220
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,459
oh and can you provide the source code

221
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,319
and they say no I didn't just read it

222
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,670
Oh kinds of things can go wrong

223
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,010
some authors they use the wrong license

224
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,840
case and points for example is West not

225
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,900
how many of you know this game okay whew

226
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,110
it's an open-source game it's a strategy

227
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,080
game turn-based that has a very nice

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,550
soundtrack and the game is GPL and what

229
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,280
is nice is that the author said okay all

230
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,100
the resources of the game should be GPL

231
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,470
as well so not only the executables also

232
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,070
all the data files images and so on

233
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,040
then somebody produced a nice soundtrack

234
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,920
they have the soundtrack in hope for

235
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,590
bass formats I think and there are no

236
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,020
source files for this the the soundtrack

237
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,090
is made using software synthesizers and

238
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,330
computers and it's rendered but the

239
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,610
authors of a large part of the the

240
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,200
soundtrack just don't want to give it

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,630
and they say no the orc file is the

242
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,540
source that is really strange because

243
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,460
this is not a preferred form of

244
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,410
fortification but the rest of people say

245
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,930
okay then it's fine so that's a big

246
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,260
program for for us for anybody who wants

247
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,240
to learn from from this and wants to

248
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,980
change something in music or learn how

249
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,210
to write music themselves sometimes

250
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,700
there is a dependency hell case in point

251
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,400
is the word press it installs some

252
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,530
minified javascript files that is used

253
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,900
when you give a wordpress site the

254
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,820
javascript files are generated from

255
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,330
source which is available but you need

256
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,990
grunts or some other tool to process

257
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,240
this and make the minified file it's

258
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,420
actually quite complex brent in turn

259
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,710
depends on no des packages so you need a

260
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,780
whole bunch of dependencies that are

261
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,100
well Debian had this problem

262
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,829
where somebody had to add like hundreds

263
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,050
of new Debian packages to the archive

264
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,810
just to fulfill the requirement that all

265
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,790
the tools used to build this minified

266
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,810
file are in the distribution so what

267
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,639
should you do either if you're a

268
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,529
distribution a package maintainer and

269
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,990
distribution or if you're someone who

270
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,670
project provides an abstract themselves

271
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,110
please sure that all the source code is

272
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,100
available if it's not then try to find

273
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,740
out what is not available file a bug if

274
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,490
you're upstream I just added if you're a

275
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,130
distribution package and then try to

276
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,529
work with upstream most of streams are

277
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,389
really kind and willing to help you but

278
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,009
if that doesn't work there really are

279
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,290
people out there who don't get it

280
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,839
then yeah you have to push back in some

281
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,550
way and maybe one option is done to just

282
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,019
say okay we're going to remove your

283
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,940
package from our very popular

284
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,170
distribution but remember so you have to

285
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,279
be really reasonable about this use your

286
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,160
common sense sometimes we have these

287
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,970
problems that I mentioned earlier that

288
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,029
maybe cannot be solved quickly or an

289
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,430
easy way but then don't you say okay I'm

290
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,110
throwing away all your work because that

291
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,759
is not helping anyone in fact that would

292
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,069
create forms for end users so don't do

293
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,219
this

294
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,100
well here have an example of an

295
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,290
executable I don't have much time but

296
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,190
I'll go through it quickly so here we

297
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,160
also have much more than meets the eye

298
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,260
so you think Oh executable I have some

299
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,760
source files in some programming

300
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,780
language like C I am compiler GCC and it

301
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,470
makes it into an executable simple right

302
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,970
no you have all kinds of things going on

303
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,200
so in the top left corner it's all the

304
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,450
build scripts so you have how to make

305
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,350
outer cone but you have the source files

306
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,580
for for your configure scripts you have

307
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,850
source file how to make this all gets

308
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,830
compiled by the auto tools but then you

309
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,900
have to configure script itself that is

310
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,420
run that's built time for your actual

311
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,970
program that produces the make file and

312
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,100
that one is then actually run to tell

313
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,520
GCC to call your C file but that pulls

314
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,470
in header files libraries your C file if

315
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,970
you have translations need to be pre

316
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,180
process to provide this Pio file for get

317
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,280
text then you have to edit it by hand

318
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,510
and then finally you get the binary

319
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,770
which is read at one time you have icons

320
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,380
images your user interface may be

321
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,459
written blade phones everything here is

322
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,199
needed to make sure that your program

323
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,780
runs and actually is useful so next time

324
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,180
you do you look at your own program or

325
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,130
your package then think about all these

326
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,189
things

327
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,200
so some other things sometimes it's not

328
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,760
really clear what is source of what is

329
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,940
not

330
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,580
sometimes things are the wrong source so

331
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,090
for C C++ breast and so on compiled

332
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,820
languages we are really sure what is

333
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,320
four scripts if something is between

334
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,600
Python or bash we think the script is

335
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,230
its own source but sometimes these are

336
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,490
both things are written by other

337
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,040
programs so they have lectures and

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,850
parser generators user interfaces may be

339
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,490
created in blade or QT creator that in

340
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,240
turn can produce CER C++ files sometimes

341
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,520
it's minified like already said so yeah

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,700
think about that I was already in the

343
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,890
appendix so documentation main pages you

344
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,990
can write many right to main page its

345
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,980
most mostly its own source but you can

346
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,080
also have it auto-generated for example

347
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,580
with proto you have taught to man you

348
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,890
have Corp and Ock that can translate

349
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,980
from one format to another info manuals

350
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,230
they are usually written in tech info or

351
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,140
they also produced by dog poop PDFs

352
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,990
nobody writes PDFs from scratch you

353
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,200
always do something else

354
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,790
HTML that's another case where it can be

355
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,800
its own source or it's generated by

356
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,290
something else and even if you write it

357
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,210
yourself then maybe it fools in CSS

358
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,110
files or other things

359
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:11,000
fons was also a big discussion debian

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,260
time some time ago mainly because a lot

361
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,580
of packages included true type fonts but

362
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,429
these ones are created by yugi phone

363
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,370
forge and they had the phone for files

364
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,920
missing butter other strange things one

365
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,960
thing is for example that phones can

366
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,950
contain executable code so there is if

367
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,260
you want to have a nice sharp font on a

368
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,440
low resolution display then you want to

369
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
make sure that all the pixels are not

370
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,630
blurry so if you have anti-aliasing you

371
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,400
actually want the pictures to be aligned

372
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,650
to the order the shape to be aligned to

373
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,270
the pixels because then it doesn't blur

374
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,450
it over multiple pixels that is a tricky

375
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,299
thing to do and the TrueType standard

376
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:04,290
has so-called white code that you can

377
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,059
include in the font that at one time

378
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,880
tells your font rendering engine that oh

379
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,809
you have to shift something a little bit

380
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:17,220
this can be written by hand well

381
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,850
probably in some programming language

382
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,309
or it can be automatically generated so

383
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,110
if you get the TrueType fonts from a

384
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,850
commercial providers usually they have

385
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,640
written this code for you but in the

386
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,100
open-source walls we have the TTFN how

387
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
to enter a package which nowadays

388
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,939
provides this bytecode

389
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:47,500
four images is also very interesting for

390
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,430
example if the lossy compressed images

391
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,640
like JPEGs versus mostly compress

392
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,910
envious big peonies and one thing I said

393
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,740
before be reasonable source code it

394
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,360
doesn't mean that something has to be

395
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,260
perfect

396
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,410
so a lossy image is perfectly fine a

397
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,020
source code there are actually people

398
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,160
who make their paintings or drawings in

399
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,080
a program like game poor critter and

400
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,760
they just save it like a JPEG and then

401
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,500
read it in and continue editing it so

402
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,790
there is no real lossy lossless source

403
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,590
for in for some images if you take an

404
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,340
image of your camera and then from some

405
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,380
kind of scene what is the source well

406
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,910
the source is not the scene outside

407
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,830
there that's the analog world we are not

408
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,110
concerned with the analog world we're

409
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,190
only talking about bits and bytes so

410
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,320
whatever the camera produced like jpg or

411
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,899
war file that is the source in that case

412
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,540
you can do destructive non-destructive

413
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,060
editing so if you use and just draw

414
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,150
some lines over some other lines then

415
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,800
what you safe and undo history is gone

416
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,310
then yeah you lost the history of the

417
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,950
whole thing but that's okay

418
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,950
of course if you have if you're working

419
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,470
in in something that stores all the

420
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,490
information so you can recover that is

421
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,510
nicer of course

422
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,640
okay for Sound of Music and I think this

423
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,350
last slide you have same as with images

424
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,200
you have boasting lossless formats if

425
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
you have recorded audio for example you

426
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,490
go to a concert and you get permission

427
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,940
to record the music they play then of

428
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,560
course not the the people were actually

429
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,780
playing artists wars but again the the

430
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,060
audio the recorded audio is the source

431
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,210
module trackers that's interesting it's

432
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,740
from the Amiga time it's a nice format

433
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,780
because it's its own source code which

434
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,450
is really rare for music because it's

435
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,030
kind of special but mostly nowadays

436
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,310
people are making electronic music with

437
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,710
software synthesizers so you have some

438
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,820
kind of music score then you have some

439
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,670
samples or instruments that are

440
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,480
generated electronically and the whole

441
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,390
setup of everything is connected to it

442
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,610
to each other and how filters are

443
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,040
applied for example is in some kind of

444
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,310
description file that describes how this

445
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,580
is done and then you compile your music

446
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,420
so to say so everything that you need to

447
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,490
do this is source

448
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:53,009
yeah that was it so I hope I made some

449
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:56,309
people more aware of issues around

450
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,609
source code and think about Oh what kind

451
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:04,799
of source code did I miss so do you have

452
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,309
any questions

453
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,419
well I'm guessing you can go to the Free

454
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,250
Software Foundation website and there's

455
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,409
a list of distributions that are

456
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,870
actually completely free and try to have

457
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,860
the source code of everything but those

458
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,659
are really small distributions most of

459
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,000
the time so I just mentioned the big

460
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,130
ones but I actually don't know why had

461
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,450
who else is working on this I think you

462
00:24:48,450 --> 00:25:11,460
were first sorry pre-trained machine are

463
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,049
you talking about like machine learning

464
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,419
neural networks that kind of stuff

465
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,360
aha okay so the what we have to repeat

466
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,299
question so what about when you have

467
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,679
neural networks that have to be trained

468
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,210
to prefer to perform some tasks for

469
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,789
example then what is the source code

470
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,470
that's very interesting maybe you have

471
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,309
some kind of seeds that you use to start

472
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,770
your training process then the compiler

473
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,049
is actually the the learning algorithm

474
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,399
that's running for some time and then it

475
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,200
produces a neural network as output that

476
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,840
that is the object code that is run at

477
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,560
runtime to do interesting stuff for you

478
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,410
the material change yes that can be that

479
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,250
can be huge

480
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,320
I would say most the biggest problem is

481
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,750
the CPU time you need for this because

482
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,670
even for simple things I know this can

483
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,450
take lots of CPU hours to produce

484
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:21,200
something that that works sorry thank

485
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,260
you

486
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:29,769
[Applause]
