1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,850
good morning everybody our next speaker

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,190
is from current to talk to us about

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,080
requirements bizarre please give a big

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,130
hand to it fun so hello and good morning

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,960
welcome to this talk about requirements

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,759
bizarre software that we have been

7
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,380
developing for 5 years now

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,989
the title is connecting end users and

9
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:29,050
developers so my name is istvan Koren

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,989
and I traveled here one hour from iwth

11
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,200
Aachen University in Germany my twitter

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,220
handle is aston here you can use the

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,350
hashtag if you want to take a pic that'd

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,100
be cool

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,060
and our organization on github where you

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,210
find all the code is here and this is

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,900
the URL of our tool so we're a Research

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,650
Institute and we in computer science and

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,470
we develop a lot of software in in big

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,820
projects and we are rolling out to a lot

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,640
of users and we always have the issue of

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
getting the feedback from the users and

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,350
I think that's quite a common problem

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,140
and this is how we how we tackle it so

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,540
well usual idea is just let the user

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,270
send emails or just make a forum a

27
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,159
discussion forum but that doesn't really

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,150
scale so what people in the open-source

29
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,240
will do is things like that so issue

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,330
trackers for example this is a

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,430
screenshot from in Bugzilla but well

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,350
it's not really end user friendly so

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,180
there are things like refactor string

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,310
bundle Jaso they are really confused

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,430
this is for the Android project but also

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,950
which write sending people to github

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,400
issues but then people they saw the

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,220
files and the code and they were turned

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,810
off and just closed that we also tried

40
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,540
sending them to JIRA with this form but

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,689
they were overwhelmed by the number of

42
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,419
fields you have to fill in here so what

43
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,939
people obviously like is when you look

44
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,690
at the App Store's from iTunes or

45
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,190
or place store is apps or comments so

46
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,320
this is for example from taking from

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,570
Facebook and people complain about the

48
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,340
software here because they like it's

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,920
just a single single text feel then you

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,090
just enter the the box there and yeah

51
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,250
but for developers it's really hard to

52
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,730
click through all the comments so yeah

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,000
what we want to achieve here is in the

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,830
pipeline from continuous integration

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,840
continuous delivery continuous

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,930
deployment what a lot of us already do

57
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,750
is another continues which is continuous

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,330
innovation so we want to listen to the

59
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,090
users and allow them to contribute to

60
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,670
send their ideas because we notice that

61
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,980
those ideas are often the best so we

62
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,910
came up with requirements Bazaar you can

63
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,610
find it under this URL requirements

64
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,060
passado

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,130
org and yeah it's a web-based to online

66
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,940
tool for continuous innovation so the

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,730
key ideas here are connecting the end

68
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,510
users the with the developers designers

69
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,680
but also researchers and other

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,780
stakeholders involved in the development

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,680
and you want to allow them to discuss to

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,340
post new ideas to send comments to

73
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,160
prioritize to vote to like just just

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,070
like on Facebook and also share share

75
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,520
ideas through to other social networks

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,860
another key aspect is making clear what

77
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,050
the developers are working on so the

78
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,060
users that they get notifications if

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,160
their idea was taken up and is currently

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,660
being developed and then rolled out

81
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,480
integrating on any context that means

82
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,239
whether we are on a mobile app or we are

83
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,260
on a desktop app where we're on your web

84
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,410
application

85
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,839
whether we're in the tram or sitting

86
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,180
here and we want to enable to make it

87
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,180
very easy to to submit new ideas and

88
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,919
finally the export options to both

89
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:29,910
directions

90
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,630
one is to social networks

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,240
or end-users to discuss further and the

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,270
other direction is to issue trackers so

93
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,790
things where developers can can work on

94
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,770
and discuss the technical details like

95
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,410
github issues or JIRA the before I show

96
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,960
you an example these are the details

97
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,960
that you're going to see it's a

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,960
progressive web app it's responsive it's

99
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,710
mobile first develop it installs on home

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,070
screen so when you visit it a couple of

101
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,410
times your Chrome browser actually asks

102
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,060
you on Android whether you want to

103
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,560
install it and then it feels like a

104
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,660
native app which is really cool it's

105
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,730
developed using polymer web components

106
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:18,040
and the backend is based on Java and

107
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,260
Microsoft's architecture we're using OPA

108
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,770
reconnect so we have our own provider

109
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,990
there but we plan to integrate Google or

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,140
other big providers as well it's hosted

111
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,240
on github and we use JIRA for issue

112
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,150
management and finally Jenkins for

113
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,340
continuous integration also the

114
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,740
continuous deployment on our build and

115
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,040
production environments and now let's

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,920
show you the software

117
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,840
well so this is it it's a requirements

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,440
passado org it's actually localized so

119
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
here the some languages of our research

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,660
group so you can switch over to German

121
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,510
very fast the responsiveness that I

122
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,450
talked about so this is it

123
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,939
all right so this is the domain page we

124
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,300
have some a lot of test projects

125
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,099
obviously and some popular projects then

126
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,960
you can click to explore the public

127
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,719
project so it's you can see everything

128
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:45,449
when you're not logged in so here is the

129
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,080
list of projects or the most popular so

130
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,389
that's - peer is a Java framework that

131
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:54,180
we develop in-house we also notice

132
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
people from outside of us that we didn't

133
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,409
know started using it for example in

134
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,250
Afghanistan 60 people are using it for

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,159
building their IT stacks it's cool our

136
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:11,189
own project and let's click here so then

137
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,219
you see the categories for example the

138
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,089
front end or the backhand and I'm just

139
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,180
switching over to the front end and

140
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,639
basically this is this is the main

141
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,860
interface so it's a card-based layout if

142
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,229
you know material design and let me sign

143
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,400
in here so that is our

144
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,189
open ID Connect provider yeah and now

145
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:47,090
I'm logged in and if I want to add

146
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,469
something for example I noticed

147
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,919
yesterday that the statistics on the

148
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,620
main page are not yet localized so stats

149
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,830
are not available in my language bad and

150
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,960
I can save it and it will just appear

151
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,240
here and then I can star it I can follow

152
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,449
it to get emails we have a nice activity

153
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,020
tracker

154
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,490
so you see what is going on so some of

155
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,250
somebody of you here or outside and the

156
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,560
Internet has already follow the project

157
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,370
cool Thanks

158
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:35,299
yes so that's basically the the web app

159
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,750
and I also want to talk a bit about the

160
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,578
future ideas

161
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,920
right so what we also have is we have

162
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,110
wept because it's web components based

163
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,090
it's very easy to actually export it to

164
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,970
other websites so we have for example

165
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,040
project that's doing augmented reality

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,860
learning we have the content the tiles

167
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,960
on their homepage integrated so the

168
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,370
people don't notice that it's actually

169
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,720
hosts and requirements buzzer it's

170
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,980
pretty cool it's so one-line integration

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,090
in WordPress

172
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,570
we have worked going on to gamify it so

173
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,430
you get badges and points and all that

174
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,980
we want to add design tools so you can

175
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,690
upload screenshots which you can already

176
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,020
do but also mark and annotate that and

177
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,560
very important thing that we want to do

178
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,320
it also embrace new communities outside

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,480
of software development so if we go back

180
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,600
you find a project a category here for

181
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,310
the requirements Bazaar which is target

182
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,470
communities so things like refugee aid

183
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,440
where people come to Germany or other

184
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
countries and they want something and

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,240
they just type it in here or

186
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,470
neighborhood assistance clubs and

187
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,900
associations a soccer club or and so on

188
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,440
so we think that we hope that this idea

189
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,140
could also help them or other other

190
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
fields so that they they learn actually

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,700
from how software developers work

192
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,530
efficiently one part of that is the

193
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,620
localization so I already showed you and

194
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,160
I have here a goodies so we already and

195
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,870
in the development branch we translated

196
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,089
it to Farsi so it's partly so there are

197
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,100
some some issues here that's why it's

198
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,650
not a release yet but very soon it will

199
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,080
be available also for in the native

200
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,000
language of the afghanistan community

201
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,089
all right so that was it so if you have

202
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,339
questions here and I will be also

203
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,740
available outside if you want to talk

204
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,860
with me afterwards thank you very much

205
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:06,720
is fund we can't please so I see a

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,310
question there back there

207
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,959
hi good product and is there M

208
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,970
management for duplicates no not yet but

209
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,910
we're working on social network analysis

210
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,870
tools to automatically get that also

211
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,540
something we want to add very soon is

212
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,350
tax so based on tag be hey tagging

213
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,220
behavior we could already well filter

214
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,700
out some of the duplicates any other

215
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,870
questions don't be shy

216
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,720
hi can we add attachment drawings just

217
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,780
to explain a little bit more so my idea

218
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:07,950
yes you can add attachments yeah so any

219
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,580
more questions another one over there

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
so the export/import that you mentioned

221
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,709
is it a kind of Excel export or an API

222
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,560
that I can connect well it's it's all a

223
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,910
REST API so today already can ask the

224
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,790
REST API we have axel export already so

225
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,910
C s comma separated values and github

226
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,889
issues export is also already there on

227
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:54,110
on the development environment so if

228
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,120
there's no more questions then I suggest

229
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,060
we wrap up began fresh fun

230
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,530
