1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,230
good afternoon

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,880
everybody welcome to this lightning talk

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,040
our next speaker is Hilda bathroom and

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,820
dancer talking about dosis give him a

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,299
big hand please

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,660
thank you I'm gonna talk about Aziz and

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,050
I have a very short presentation about

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,040
myself just to give you a hint I'm a job

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,650
I started my career in programming in

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,870
Java in 1998 and it was my first

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,629
experience programming and my first

12
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,649
program was a applet to show graph

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,460
shorts and I I've worked with Java since

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,870
then until I was hired by université

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,739
catholique de Laval to actually rescue a

16
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,730
project so I because of my background

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,090
with Java Java Java I I was hired there

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,490
to save this project so I worked very

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,400
hard for quite two-week quite sometimes

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,710
too we're working hard to save this

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,140
project from from failure and actually I

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,049
didn't succeed that's why I'm here and

23
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,560
the project was like working working

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,009
working no progress so what happens when

25
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,450
you don't succeed is these technical

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,119
decisions come up down so hierarchy

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,850
authorities try to push some

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,390
technologies so you do actually have to

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,240
listen and do what they want otherwise

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,659
you cannot continue so that what's

31
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,170
happened in our case hierarchy imposes a

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,810
technology and then was we we were

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,869
scared I've been doing everything our

34
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,659
Java stuff he write everything in

35
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,399
something new that's very scary so but

36
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,970
the thing is

37
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,260
lesson learned was that actually we were

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,090
quite happy with the new fee so the new

39
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,580
thing was Python in the whole platform

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,140
that comes with it and we actually are

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,510
doing much better today with Python than

42
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,209
with Java before so it was a good

43
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,790
pressure and what we are doing with

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,090
Python is actually a new open source

45
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,570
project colin aziz so oh this is an

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,760
initiative open source initiative from

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,400
université catholique de Louvain to

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,070
rethink how the university works I'm

49
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,040
talking about the administrative part

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,620
how to history students how to to

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,850
organize classes and teachers allocate

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,590
student in classes print the diploma

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,540
certificates and everything from the

54
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,459
administrative part so oh this is a

55
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,400
product open-source product to manage

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,680
universities or higher education

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,970
institutions so in order to replace the

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,970
old system we have to rethink the way we

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,810
work in the way to do that was to be

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,750
completely open so we could have in

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,329
contributions not only from our usual

62
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,549
members of the administrative and

63
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,370
bureaucratic members but also from

64
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,120
teachers students so now they can say

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,150
how they want to use their applications

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,430
they can we can listen to them and they

67
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,359
can contribute so all these opening the

68
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,590
door for students teachers in the whole

69
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,340
academic community what we are doing now

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,820
is modernizing how we work how the

71
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,760
process of the University and put them

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,350
into exists what is actually happen also

73
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,070
is oh this is actually inspiring

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,010
students and teachers

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,890
to provide some additional services to

76
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,430
students everything is happening at the

77
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,180
same time actually and also departments

78
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,210
of the university instead of asking

79
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,300
asking asking to add something new they

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,210
are actually doing it which is something

81
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,620
that never happened before we are

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,560
strongly investing strongly in open

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,410
source so the whole stack that runs all

84
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,060
this is 100% open source everything is

85
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,880
open source from OpenNebula and to the

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,340
user interface everything is open and we

87
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,860
desperately want to share it with other

88
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,950
university so we want to you may be we

89
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,010
profit from this experience for the

90
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,540
moment two universities are developing

91
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,140
and using this project is université

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,530
catholique deliver the main sponsor

93
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,020
University celui both University are

94
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,780
talking about merge and stuff like that

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,810
nowadays but actually the discussion to

96
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,720
contribute to this happen a lot of time

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,180
before so like one year and a half

98
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,410
before all these discussions so even if

99
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,170
they don't marriage so we will continue

100
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,270
in the project will develop will

101
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,630
continue contributing this is the user

102
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,990
interface and the first feedback we had

103
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,160
was it is clean it is easy to memorize

104
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,090
it is easy to navigate it is far easier

105
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,760
than the previous version that you have

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,700
to know a lot about the domain in order

107
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,800
to use it now we deliver only the

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,410
necessary only the service that they

109
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,490
need we don't do much more because they

110
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,130
assimilate easier if we do do it simple

111
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,360
this internal page that one of the first

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,770
implementations in the project was the

113
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,290
scoring code

114
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,350
so teachers everywhere in the world and

115
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,260
also in the university they encode the

116
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,890
scores of the student directly into Aziz

117
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,120
and that it saves a lot of time for from

118
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,660
all departments and teachers it was a

119
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,020
revolution in terms of scoring encoding

120
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,340
in the university

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,670
this is Aziz but we also have a port of

122
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,280
version so this is also available for

123
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,260
you know we have back office and front

124
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,280
office so we saw back office now we are

125
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,250
so we see the front office which deals

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,040
with in script so description and

127
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,520
register asian admission process and so

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,400
on so during this experience we actually

129
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,740
are moving from Java to Python and it

130
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,390
has been a amazing experience after

131
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,560
years developing Java in going to Python

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,120
I changed my mind like water it's

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,700
amazing I'm not saying that Python it's

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,910
a great fantastic language language I'm

135
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,550
saying that you get your stuff done with

136
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,510
Python that's it so we managed to solve

137
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,960
all our major problems Cal ability

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,600
problems everything we had in the past

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,810
with Java six months after adopting

140
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,890
Python which of all of them is we we are

141
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,100
stone it even more excited about jungle

142
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,220
because all the stuff we had to write

143
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,330
ourselves manually we had ready to use

144
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,160
in jungle so it was amazing so I really

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,799
recommend it and it changed the way we

146
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,179
think about software

147
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,130
so we've also had the transition from

148
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,559
proprietary to open-source and it was

149
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,680
not easy because people who used used to

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,890
develop closed code they keep thinking

151
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,130
like that so they started putting a hard

152
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,190
coded reference to internal services

153
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,770
they forget to come and forget to put to

154
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,310
remove direct code they forget comments

155
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,410
they forget the license so they were

156
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,130
working like before but now we have to

157
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,940
see the quality of code much more this

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,820
is much more important than before so

159
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,270
after some times the team was adapted

160
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,300
easily so it's another another

161
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,450
experience the code is much more clear

162
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,350
than before

163
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm not saying that the best code in the

164
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,130
world but it's much better

165
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,320
so people are learning how to code

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,640
better nowadays than before and the

167
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,910
motivation comes naturally so what

168
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,520
happens is people who are working

169
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,100
without no pressure

170
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,400
even during their free time and free

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,720
holidays so I I have commit during the

172
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,810
weekend I have comments all the time it

173
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,390
never happened before now they are

174
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,940
actually doing things that we never

175
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,570
expected and it's amazing they just

176
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,260
don't stop coding contribution is the

177
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,280
the main aspect of value so nowadays we

178
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,770
have four full-time developer five

179
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,410
full-time developers paid full-time and

180
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,570
then we have 15 additional contributors

181
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,040
students personal external people and we

182
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,580
need more two guys or two girls to join

183
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,450
our team in the as soon as possible to

184
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,070
help us to to do it faster than before

185
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,530
so instead of paying license we are

186
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,170
creating jobs that's what we think about

187
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,750
open-source we prefer

188
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,560
money in opportunities even a consultant

189
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,370
can come and help us to develop better

190
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,340
Python code jungle code so we are paying

191
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,550
someone for for doing the job not that

192
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,630
license that we don't see the the value

193
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,970
a group of faculties get together to

194
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,540
develop an additional application to

195
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,170
manage dissertations never happened

196
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,990
before so we had a huge contribution

197
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,830
from them Faculty of Medicine it lets in

198
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,610
contributed with a whole new module for

199
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,050
internship we had an administrative

200
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,080
department completely isolated from our

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,020
department who develop a model for to

202
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,480
manage assistants and we actually

203
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,520
finished a master tease this is last

204
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,610
year we have to master T's ongoing about

205
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,670
the whole thing of these community open

206
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,880
source and so on and we are riding up

207
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,300
right now a scientific paper with kyun

208
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,580
11 which is the other university from

209
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,350
the Dutch part so it's amazing just one

210
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,810
year actually the first release of of

211
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,530
this came out and 31 January last year

212
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,530
we are now celebrating the first

213
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,370
anniversary here in this talk so it's a

214
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,660
quite good result so far also there is a

215
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,000
product developed by students they

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,970
created this fin call it ingenious which

217
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,470
is on line coding tests so we are going

218
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,140
to integrate with Aziz so students who

219
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,940
perform tests using these two the scores

220
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,670
will be injected directly into aziz

221
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,540
automatically so the students are busy

222
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,330
developing the integration right now and

223
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,810
this is the first time we heard about

224
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,760
something developed by our student which

225
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,190
is actually going to be integrated with

226
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,030
the

227
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,660
the staff at the university it's really

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,160
exciting so in terms of architecture we

229
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,340
take care to keep all these completely

230
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,810
isolated so we don't make reference to

231
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,090
internal stuff so in this case here we

232
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,690
have the two systems all these days of

233
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,180
this portal and they are completely

234
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,580
independent so if all this goes down all

235
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,910
this portal keeps working before this

236
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,130
portal goes down this keep working

237
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,980
normally so they are isolated but they

238
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,760
share the same kind of data they use the

239
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,520
same but database but different data

240
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,280
sets and it's to improve performance

241
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,750
finally from the internal part the

242
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,440
internal stuff we have we use a ESB to

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,620
visual aid all the complexity inside and

244
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,180
avoid that Aussies get busy with SHP

245
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,020
Moodle and other stuff so we consume and

246
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,910
provide rest standard data so they they

247
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,550
can measure manage it without any direct

248
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,270
reference everything is open source so

249
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,970
we have some products here open source

250
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,390
products we are proud to use and we are

251
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,970
we would love to share the experience

252
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,660
with each one and they are really great

253
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,980
they are serving big problems and that's

254
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,710
my talk thank you very much and I'll

255
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,710
treat you

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:44,940
[Applause]
