1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Josh thanks for coming to my talk

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,260
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,720
control so I'm the CEO co-founder of a

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,060
company called poly sink LSCC

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,570
is one of our one of our various

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,179
products and and right now the only open

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,920
source one so we're sort of maintaining

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,480
that and giving that out to the

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,830
community so this matters to us

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,460
infrastructure layer for autonomous car

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,489
software applications so in fact you can

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,239
think of this as so the tolerance

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,489
concepts and safety concepts that are

14
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,890
the pioneered in distributed computing

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,050
systems to the car so we're kind of the

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,579
underlying of the structure that enables

17
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,609
a fault tolerance central compute

18
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,329
architecture in the cars so we think

19
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,269
this will be completely important and

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,789
critical for building autonomous cars

21
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,290
because of course they use very powerful

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,990
processors and very difficult to get to

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,759
safety certification with those without

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:22,240
new approaches an ecosystem around us we

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,040
don't actually do application software

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,200
so how do we build an ecosystem is a

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,500
question so this is what we built a sec

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,390
for so the first one is startups in this

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,250
space so traditionally automotive has

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,250
been extremely close to to startups very

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,290
difficult to build technology and

32
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,640
especially the commercialize technology

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,140
in this space because it's so

34
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,350
proprietary so what you're seeing with

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,759
autonomous driving is that there's some

36
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,560
there's some challenges to implementing

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,409
that there's challenges to the OEMs and

38
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,000
the two ones supply chain Auto

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
and in difficulty solving themselves and

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,280
suddenly this industry is open for for

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,660
startups like it hasn't been for in a

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,820
maybe like 40 years so that's pretty

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
awesome we want to know more of that we

44
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,669
want to see bigger fleets really about

45
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,940
achieving production and and scale and

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,870
so for us more causes is better

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,550
and then finally safer safer testing

48
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,370
we've seen a lot of different approaches

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,750
working at work working across this

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,460
industry for four years want to give you

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,260
two approaches to getting control of a

52
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,920
vehicle and some of them are sort of

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:39,350
much less safe than others so pretty

54
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,090
like hobby servos in your car and try to

55
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,430
figure out you know how to do this yeah

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,870
and the least safe action would like to

57
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,050
give you the easy entry to building a

58
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,050
safe and controllable car so we're not

59
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,300
usually started with this beautiful car

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,980
idea actually it's kind of stretched out

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,810
unfortunately it's not that long in real

62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,959
life

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:13,690
yes 500 us if you want to go sketchy

64
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,940
rebuild you know rebuild titles after

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,440
accidents and things you can get under

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,880
ten thousand dollars on this particular

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,920
car and the key to this car is that not

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,810
only is it inexpensive it's available

69
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,340
worldwide and basically its own

70
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,350
configuration it's very very simple so

71
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,000
it's really easy to reverse engineer and

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,910
importantly it has a electronic power

73
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,910
steering and my wire although everybody

74
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,299
has that so I'll explain that those are

75
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,799
you know the future so just to give you

76
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,239
an idea of what the state of the eye it

77
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,580
looks like in you know typical or

78
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,830
typically this is a this is a control

79
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,830
robot actually this is probably a

80
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,940
half-million-dollar rig that like I

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,060
think was at Ford for users to test test

82
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,470
their vehicles and it looks super

83
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,450
haphazard because it is it's all bolted

84
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,140
on to bolted on to the car

85
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,820
we've seen everything from from this

86
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,980
type of implementation to like the

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,930
hobby-grade version of this which is

88
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,450
super sketchy and then really really

89
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,800
nice integrated cars too so really

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,340
nicely they're great cars do exist but

91
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,209
they're still incredibly expensive

92
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,450
basically you can't get into this a

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,220
controlled car that's like done well for

94
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,000
under 100 150 grand so how do we solve

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,580
that

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,919
so it's our LSCC let me play this video

97
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:43,360
nope okay so into LCC so this is a 2014

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,160
Kia Soul under controlled by the SCC

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,950
it's using me it causes own systems so

100
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,560
power steering throw my wire and then we

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,060
have to add some other stuff for the

102
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,710
brakes but this is this is it so this is

103
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,770
a guy controlling this on I have a game

104
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,480
controller interface a laptop or

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,890
whatever but you can see there's you

106
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,780
know it's very smooth and and

107
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,250
controllable and is awesome

108
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,790
so that's a sec so how you do it alright

109
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,960
how much does it cost

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,570
so normally so normally it is this this

111
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,220
type of invitation like I said that's

112
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,690
hundred hundred fifty thousand dollars

113
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,460
you've probably seen if you've been if

114
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,160
you've seen the cars you know Mike

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,850
Nvidia you know

116
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,410
and you often see them in the news now

117
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,240
demo cars they're always a Lincoln MKZ

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,450
right we can MKZ costs about a hundred

119
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,760
two hundred fifty grand to get in fully

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,650
out weekly in the car and do it fully

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,020
outfitted by wire by wire system with a

122
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,630
sec you can do that for ten to fifteen

123
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,230
including the car that's awesome even

124
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,030
good it's safer did something funny

125
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,380
happen or is that just that's

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,890
hilariously awesome that's great so a

127
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,540
key part of this is that it's not only

128
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,310
and not only is it inexpensive to build

129
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,410
yourself you can go the hard way from

130
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,120
our side or whatever or from from github

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,910
but it's also all open right so those

132
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,470
are systems as I said hundred under 50

133
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,180
granted proprietary they're totally

134
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,980
closed you can't get into them they

135
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,000
often use like vendor specific IP like

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
interface files and things like that

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,820
that they can't give away to you this

138
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,670
one is completely done with Arduino so

139
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:30,530
how about it there's four major modules

140
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,410
to it to the to the LCC system there's a

141
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,690
steel module a break module a floral

142
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,090
module and then a gateway each of these

143
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,610
is connected up over a can network a

144
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,470
private can network and one knows what

145
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,360
can is okay and then there's an external

146
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,190
interface for control we just can

147
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,080
because it's fault on it is it is all

148
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,280
the wonderful things other than I

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,580
bandwidth things

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,550
it's its fault on and you know resilient

151
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,640
and and cheap so we use can to

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,170
communicate with the modules and like

153
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:12,560
other people get it so doing things the

154
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,460
the key one that is difficult to control

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,730
the Kia Soul is this is this thing right

156
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,040
here which is called a column drive II

157
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,140
pass system column drive electronic

158
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,480
power assisted steering system and then

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,030
in Kia parlance that's mdps motor driven

160
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,030
power power steering so kia is a really

161
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,409
great

162
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,229
they have an online site called Kia Tech

163
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,899
Infocom and for like $19 for 72 hours

164
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,869
you can have access to 100% of service

165
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:43,389
web service information about the cars

166
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,550
all the wiring diagrams troubleshooting

167
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,830
stuff like very very deep information is

168
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,110
that it's actually a very simple little

169
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,309
self-contained system when he has is a

170
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,389
brushless motor there's a motor

171
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,399
controller and then there's some analog

172
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,949
torque sensors which switch which sense

173
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,099
your hand on the wheel the oil works and

174
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,959
typical operation is that you put your

175
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,879
animal and if you've ever used an

176
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,379
electronic power steering system you'll

177
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,059
notice it has just a little bit of like

178
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,739
wiggle E&S to it like a little wiggle

179
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,019
replay that's a torque that's a torque

180
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,759
sensor in between the wheel and the

181
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,219
column that's sensing your input and so

182
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,860
it's job the the power driven electronic

183
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,809
power steering system it's job is to

184
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,749
decrease the force that you put on the

185
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:32,049
give it a little bit goes oh that's the

186
00:08:32,049 --> 00:09:00,850
control which is that we switch over to

187
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:10,300
the LCC system ads they learn a lot

188
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,699
converters so we go from you know pulses

189
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:18,160
to actual voltage control and then what

190
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,180
we've done and you'll see it in the

191
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,380
software if you get into the github

192
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,340
we've done is we've we've had do a

193
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,670
[Applause]

194
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,050
response to that system so all the

195
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,279
partners were power steering is that

196
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,959
it's try it for controllers trying to

197
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,519
make it feel a certain way write it well

198
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,290
nice dead spot in the middle it changes

199
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,519
the response depending on how fast

200
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,220
you're going we really want to keep a

201
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,449
light touch and say very much at the

202
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,309
edge of this system and so what we did

203
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,709
is we we were able to to linearize the

204
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,509
response of that using a velocity

205
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,279
control as opposed to a rotational

206
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,259
velocity control as to a as opposed to a

207
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,089
position control so the result of that

208
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,430
is that you can command an angle for the

209
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,500
steering wheel and it will go to it at a

210
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,389
specified speed and it does so very

211
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,809
smoothly and accurately and and that's

212
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,889
awesome so that's number one

213
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,740
shield so this you know and it has screw

214
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,420
terminals for all their relevant sensors

215
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,490
we provide all the wiring diagrams and

216
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,179
things like that

217
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,709
we don't specifically say we

218
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,509
specifically say a new Kia Soul there's

219
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,939
some other details that we leave out so

220
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:19,809
that it's a little bit more

221
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:20,649
generalizable

222
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,809
I should mention that the intent of the

223
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,610
LCC system is that you can apply this

224
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,519
general methodology to other vehicles as

225
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,230
well but that the key is the simple one

226
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,850
and it's cheap so we focus our efforts

227
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,110
there so that's part of why we open

228
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,480
sourced it one of the people to to move

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,490
things this is this is is that is that

230
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,589
we stay at the very edges of the system

231
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,980
so electrically well as close to

232
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,839
electrically will effectively a hand on

233
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,759
the wheel and in the case of this system

234
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,100
and so other approaches that you may

235
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,959
have seen on internet or whatever of

236
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,490
controlling the other and kazeer are

237
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,079
different things they often use a cam

238
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,429
based approach where you're spoofing

239
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,079
Kansas signals and the problem of that

240
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,639
is the way that's often done is

241
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,139
especially for steering is that you

242
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,149
spoof the power or excuse me that the

243
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,790
parking assist system which is the

244
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,050
system that you know you pull up next to

245
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,309
a parking spot and it spins the wheel

246
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,050
and parks you in it you get Diwali

247
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,519
really expensive car typically to do

248
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,509
that because there's only a few that

249
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,670
have that functionality but you also

250
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,199
typically you're telling this the car

251
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,120
that it's driving like under five miles

252
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,540
an hour

253
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,470
all the time and and and that's what it

254
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,089
basically gives you it gives you the

255
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,699
steering control so the our system

256
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,069
doesn't require that type of spoofing so

257
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,800
basically where the work

258
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,180
staying completely at the edge of the

259
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,040
system we maintain the safety case that

260
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,959
the manufacturer intended allowing their

261
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,850
around their control system so that's

262
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,000
key so so the redundancy in those in a

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,860
the redundancy that exists in us in

264
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,870
those torque sensors all the way back to

265
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,029
redundancies in the in the control

266
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,769
system for the for the wheel are all

267
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,480
maintained completely we don't spook

268
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
them in any way but we do get full full

269
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
control of this wheel and in fact the

270
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,250
steering wheel in this car you know can

271
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,350
hurt you it's so strong so as opposed to

272
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,670
other systems where you end up with like

273
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,430
I'm they artificially block or your

274
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,640
control for various reasons so yeah

275
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,690
that's doing control the next one is

276
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,029
long and it doesn't really require too

277
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,680
much more just description than what

278
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,180
I've already given you this throws the

279
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,680
same the same way although it's just

280
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,910
less it's just less safety critical

281
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,529
right because model response in the car

282
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,110
is less immediate than then a steering

283
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,630
response so this is a throttle so this

284
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,250
is just some examples followed by wire

285
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,680
images but almost every car like modern

286
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,720
car has gone to throttle by wire and

287
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,790
what that means is that your foot pedal

288
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,890
is completely disconnected from the from

289
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,270
the throttle body and the engine that

290
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,160
actually controls how fast it's trying

291
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,589
to rev so again this is just the same

292
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,270
type of analog spoofing attack and in

293
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,550
fact we we use the AI potion called an

294
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:05,010
attack approach board so to say it's the

295
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,600
same deal and then the kia you know it's

296
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,970
the same like though I miss the same

297
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,829
sensors kind of cool let's see

298
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:17,130
and then finally brakes so it breaks

299
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,299
[Applause]

300
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,750
with cars and maybe everybody has

301
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,000
experience is that there's no interface

302
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,610
to these damn things so you end up you

303
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,800
want to do something with a car you have

304
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,180
to hack it the only interface that

305
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,579
exists on most cars this is called obd2

306
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:41,459
and and so that is yeah everyone so the

307
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,990
girls are all car people this is awesome

308
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,660
I mean Susan seems like the only

309
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,820
standardized interface to a car and

310
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,060
there's been like this massive influx of

311
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,130
startups right that are creating around

312
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,990
not one interface so in some ways this

313
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,450
is kind of a call to action for a call

314
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,910
to action for the OEMs to open up their

315
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,200
cars and allow us to have like a

316
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,700
developer mode and there were something

317
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
like that we'll see if that like becomes

318
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,810
a thing but you know whatever we've been

319
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,130
able to do with phones for a long time

320
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,890
so and that's that's certainly the case

321
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,860
for breaks right break so spoofing the e

322
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,490
pass and the and the throttle a

323
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,260
relatively simple the brakes get into

324
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,640
something that's kind of ugly interface

325
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,100
but there is not the car itself doesn't

326
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,230
typically have the facility to break

327
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:44,830
itself so so the power so the cars to be

328
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,760
like an ABS unit and then roll this ABS

329
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,070
unit in the case of a log brake system

330
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,310
in the case of a you know of a skid or

331
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,120
something like that it's something to

332
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,100
modulate brake pressure that the driver

333
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,480
is providing and in some cases to

334
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,280
provide a little bit of your own but in

335
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,230
terms of control a car you have full

336
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,850
access you need to have full access to

337
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,680
the braking facilities of the vehicle

338
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,470
and as it turns out creating that

339
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,090
actuation in any meaningful way is

340
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,880
difficult right so we've seen anything

341
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,490
like you put a piston on the brake pedal

342
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,100
that's really so that's it slow and

343
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,270
dangerous we tried to design our own

344
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,520
sort of sort of form about once it was

345
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,100
really bad the way we do this is we have

346
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,340
to add an actuator so this particular

347
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,690
action later that we add is a better

348
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,160
picture this but this is it integrated

349
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,140
into the end of the sole is from a

350
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,410
Toyota Prius so this this particular

351
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,990
actuator is you can get from in a

352
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,610
junkyard it cost about 200 bucks if you

353
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,870
want to buy a new on the remand it's

354
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,960
like a thousand but it's a it's a it's a

355
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,900
Denzil unit it's rated for four

356
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,050
automotive duty cycle which is awesome

357
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,870
and the critical thing this one comes

358
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,340
from 2004-2007

359
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,590
Prius this one doesn't have any

360
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,510
electronics in it so it's just a pin out

361
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,850
basically to a set of solenoids pressure

362
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,470
sensors and a big pump this particular

363
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,230
unit has an accumulator high-pressure

364
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,900
pump has like five or seven pressure

365
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,960
sensors in it including all the safety

366
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,430
stuff around out so if you over

367
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,960
pressurize the pump it'll blow a seal

368
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,480
and things like that and then then it

369
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,950
has a set of solenoids that are rated

370
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,440
either for continuous duty or for PWM so

371
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,580
that's pretty great so what we did with

372
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,800
this you see is we created a board to

373
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,960
control this unit and I'll show you

374
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,510
hydraulic li how that hooks up so you

375
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,510
thought this was just a like total you

376
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,060
know electronics or you know code class

377
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,190
this is like not at all so this is

378
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,160
requires unhooking brake lines getting

379
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,200
covered in brake fluid and then hooking

380
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,060
them up to this thing and this the way

381
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,290
it works is you have your master

382
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,230
cylinder on your foot pedal you have two

383
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,940
outs this is typically than this

384
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,350
any modern air brake system there's a

385
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,760
there's a redundancy in the brake system

386
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,339
those two outs go instead of directly to

387
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,380
the the stock abs unit which is this

388
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,970
blurry word here that usually has two

389
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,430
ends so rather than again we can sort of

390
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,020
take the man-in-the-middle approach and

391
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,060
what we do is we just clip that between

392
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,010
the master we put this unit between the

393
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,599
master cylinder and the ABS you know

394
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,520
there are lots of different problems

395
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,610
with this that this magical box solved

396
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,170
so I would encourage you though this may

397
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,680
seem like a total hack this is for my

398
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
experience incredibly slick so let this

399
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,210
out what this does is two to two lines

400
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,160
come out and they come into these two

401
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
solenoids SMC to and SMC one there's

402
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
pressure sensors there and those are

403
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,910
actually continuous rated 12 volts

404
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,410
alright so what happens is you can power

405
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,930
those up and you completely walk out the

406
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,740
foot pedal you can't press that thing

407
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,080
down anymore but we can sense what

408
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,370
pressure you're putting into it the

409
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,690
first demonstration we did with this we

410
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,850
actually created a full detached brake

411
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,770
by wire system in the Kia so you can

412
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,380
press on the

413
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,300
and then we would actuate the brakes for

414
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,400
you which is kind of cool so in so now

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,380
the foot pedal is blocked off what we do

416
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,300
is we take a pump we charge up our

417
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,950
accumulator you see on the pressure

418
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,990
sensor there that allows us to that

419
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,430
allows us to modulate that pressure we

420
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,230
just put on a on a really simple loop

421
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,860
very simple or see they fill solenoids

422
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,140
and for spill solenoids so very simple

423
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,060
we just we can pressurize the the

424
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,070
outgoing circuits or we can release them

425
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,110
this is very different in those

426
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,940
automated braking systems this is very

427
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,530
atypical so normally they have these

428
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,890
crazy like eight to nine solenoid

429
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,600
systems with all kinds of crazy

430
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,330
backwards looping things that they're

431
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,190
very complicated and they contain a

432
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,570
bunch of electronics that are all housed

433
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,310
in epoxy and you can never get out this

434
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,530
one is just a pin out which is the to

435
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,060
these outgoing circuits we just block

436
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,440
off we don't need them and they only

437
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,480
truly pass through into the ABS unit and

438
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,230
by using PWM on the solenoids were able

439
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,390
to modulate the pressure going in now

440
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,240
and we have you know we've tested that

441
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
pretty extensively and it tracks really

442
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,220
well so that sounds complicated in it

443
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,760
and and maybe you know like overwhelming

444
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,830
but it's actually not that hard if you

445
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,570
put it in you look up our board to it

446
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,730
and then you you know run the code and

447
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,560
we taking care of the control that's the

448
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,910
prototype of the board it looks

449
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,700
gargantuan we shrunk this now in the in

450
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,050
the shipment that we actually ship SS

451
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,150
you see to about thirty percent of that

452
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,950
size that's where smaller does take an

453
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,800
Arduino the bigger one they got thank

454
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:57,040
you much powered power systems on it and

455
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,430
the MOSFETs that are you know cooled and

456
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,020
things like that so you'd have to do a

457
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,790
little bit of housings steps to keep

458
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,680
that in a good good shape we usually put

459
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,310
in the in the glove box

460
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,050
okay then finally we have two gateway

461
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,870
into the chassis so this is this is my

462
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,630
gateway icon

463
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,130
we actually just right now we're

464
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,450
building right now we just use a this is

465
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,460
our open source can shield which

466
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,840
anyone's played with cannon has probably

467
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,810
I was like five of these we just have

468
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,370
two of these one of them connects to the

469
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,590
private bus that we use to control the

470
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,300
control systems and then the other one

471
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,330
connects to the connects to the vehicle

472
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,480
bus and so what were able to get from

473
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,860
that is pretty cool but so we tweak

474
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,380
there's three can buses on the Kia Soul

475
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,510
there's a sea-can bus which is like a

476
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,730
chassis can there's a B can bus which is

477
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,710
the body can and then there's a media

478
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,260
one M can we in the body the body bus

479
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,480
but the the control one gives us access

480
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,330
we can turn on and off the headlights we

481
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,370
can we can do like diapers and things

482
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,410
like that the problem is we haven't

483
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,150
figured out yet how to do turn signals

484
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,910
we're getting there but basically you

485
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,890
know whatever turn on turn setting

486
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,620
yourself this is a it costs $10,000 come

487
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:21,600
on the car is is a pretty interesting

488
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,730
task there's a bunch of if you're

489
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,230
familiar with automotive cans systems

490
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,720
there's typically no spec to them but

491
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,420
they're super easy to you know to parse

492
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,120
off the wire so you know we the way that

493
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,060
we the only actually used for LCC

494
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,380
through the through the through the

495
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,210
Gateway is the steering angle and we

496
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,710
simply reverse engineer that from the

497
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,950
the can the can signals for anyone who's

498
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,870
familiar with can this particular Kia

499
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,270
Soul is awesome all the signals break on

500
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,460
bite lines there's no sharing of bytes

501
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,430
and it's yes it's it's super easy to

502
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,050
reverse engineer we just haven't haven't

503
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,340
done all of it so that part of my

504
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,900
opening of the community we'd love for

505
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,880
you guys to help us with with that

506
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,410
there's certainly people in our most

507
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,600
skilled at reverse engineering can buses

508
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
than we are we also get although we do

509
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,280
two PIDs and and

510
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,710
you know all the all the normal goodness

511
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,140
that you get off there other signals we

512
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,670
can have brake pressure we get

513
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,260
individual wheel speeds which is neat

514
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,720
and turn signal status there's a bunch

515
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,920
of information you get off the bus so

516
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,970
you don't know get off obd2 so I talked

517
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,410
a lot about safety I talked a little bit

518
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,940
about safety I

519
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,010
the overarching safety concept for this

520
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,770
particular thing is is that it has a

521
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,680
fail-safe mode which is that when the

522
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,030
whole system is powered off all the

523
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,930
relays default to a 2 ohm that goes

524
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,500
close to normal open status include all

525
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,180
that all the solenoids in the brake

526
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,730
system power open basically if you if

527
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,340
you hard shutdown power in the system it

528
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,940
returns the car to a stock state and so

529
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,500
that's the that's the overarching safety

530
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,840
concept we have implemented we have

531
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,580
implemented manual disables so you can

532
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,650
grab the steering wheel you can touch

533
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,120
the brake or you touch the throttle and

534
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,280
it will actually it will disable the it

535
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,660
will disable the system not in a hard

536
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,090
shutdown mode I will say that if you do

537
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,860
hard shut it down there's a disk you can

538
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,180
have a discontinuity in some of the

539
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,220
signals and you can fault these to use

540
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,960
on the car but that's there the other

541
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,280
great thing like it is that you can get

542
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,710
the factory reset tool for like a

543
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,510
hundred bucks on eBay so another reason

544
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,070
another reason to use that fabulous

545
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:33,720
little little car we have a coding

546
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:42,270
standard it's misra ish it's an Xuan and

547
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,330
impenetrable and we didn't want to place

548
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,650
that and we also can't distribute it

549
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,190
because it costs money so we kind of

550
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,440
been on version of that that's just

551
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,120
includes code examples and it's simpler

552
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,400
a little bit more approachable and exist

553
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,410
in our in our contributing dot MD fall

554
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,880
from a from a natural safety perspective

555
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,350
some of you may have alarm bells going

556
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,570
off and going this is not an acyl you

557
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,670
you guys you know let's see you would

558
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,820
say

559
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:17,200
and that's in fact true ISO 26262 the

560
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
automotive functional Safety Center does

561
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,070
allow for diagnostic based safety

562
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,860
systems it's not like we have not we're

563
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,010
not in any way claiming a Asil rating

564
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,960
for this system but we do implement

565
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,290
Diagnostics on all our outputs so

566
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,060
there's so we have Diagnostics I'm can

567
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,650
that's a keep all modules publish

568
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,110
publish to keep alive and if you miss if

569
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,550
we miss that first written period then

570
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,460
we then we disable control there's an

571
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,850
ADC and added a canopy and the PWM check

572
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,830
as well so for all signals that we

573
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,690
receive we check them identity for all

574
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,490
signals that we send we check them

575
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,890
redundant ly and then we have a and then

576
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,930
we do the same thing for PWM so it's not

577
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,710
it's not it's certainly not yeah you

578
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,920
know dual processor lockstep arrangement

579
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,590
however it's it's it is checking itself

580
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,340
and you have you have a driver there and

581
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,400
again the overarching fallback is the

582
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,580
the the driver that can disable control

583
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,500
of the system at at a time either

584
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,000
through a hard shutdown or through

585
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,470
grabbing steering wheel or those other

586
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,850
things we have a code review process you

587
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,830
can read more about in our contributing

588
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,140
MD we just you know it's a it's a peer

589
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,200
review process and we and we maintain

590
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,030
the the repo so that we have we actually

591
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,180
actually have ISO 26262 trained safety

592
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,030
certified individuals reviewing incoming

593
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,490
code and then finally we include some

594
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,820
unit and integration testing there the

595
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,780
important thing is that we actually we

596
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,299
actually do tests on

597
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,459
Karev's on functioning vehicles on the

598
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,289
road we make sure that you know

599
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,330
thresholds are correct and and you know

600
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,649
test past and things like that so we

601
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:58,259
have a four cent set of testing firmware

602
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,690
also when we build boards and ship we

603
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,580
end them through a set of testing as

604
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,289
well property based testing kits test

605
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,359
into this you know kind of in the next

606
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,049
few months

607
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,940
well part no cos CC for our company is

608
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,849
providing us kind of microcosm of

609
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:16,229
learning how to build a company that can

610
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:17,909
build safety certified codes so this is

611
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,820
a journey that companies take and this

612
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:36,869
is part of our part of our journey I

613
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,399
will say that we are the only people

614
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,469
contributed code so far but you know

615
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:45,629
it's early reduction so for startups

616
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:47,549
this makes a huge difference you can't

617
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:50,849
you know basically yawn to raise money

618
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:53,369
to go get your your algorithms on the

619
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,700
road so that's huge we've shipped sweaty

620
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,579
kits we had an initial buy of you know

621
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,169
boards that we built we've also had some

622
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:03,509
we had some guy in LA build like five of

623
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:04,859
them themselves which is pretty cool

624
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:05,279
feeling

625
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,039
and we've also built for cars for

626
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,809
different companies ourselves so we do

627
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:12,779
we do car building services for our cup

628
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,419
you know it's part of our company and

629
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,959
then we also do we also we also doing

630
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,049
locally guided builds so we'll have

631
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,459
companies come in this is we've only

632
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,139
done one but we'll company come in we

633
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:26,999
actually build their car with them for

634
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,159
two weeks they sit alongside us we teach

635
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,200
them you know all the water is how the

636
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,639
fundamentals of all the systems work and

637
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:34,440
that's pretty cool because that means

638
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,179
they can go home and and build their own

639
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,119
cars for much cheaper crossing we build

640
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,379
cars we charge a lot of money for it

641
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:45,899
because you know like it's work so we

642
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,589
feel safe in a safety case for for this

643
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:51,119
particular system which is you know not

644
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,849
only is critical it's like an industry

645
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,339
first but it's often overlooked and I

646
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,049
think one of the most valuable parts of

647
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:41,789
the system we don't have to add a brake

648
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,229
actuator anymore get our hands messy

649
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,969
with breakthrough you just send those

650
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:50,039
beautiful can commands into it it's

651
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,299
pretty heavily protected on the canned

652
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,789
side so if anyone's looking for an

653
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,919
exploratory project this is the one

654
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,599
we're poking into this ourselves and

655
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,269
finding that it's harder than we thought

656
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:07,229
but yes we think we can do the same say

657
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,690
the question was what's required what's

658
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,429
required is it just the same type of us

659
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:13,289
at reverse engineering on the can bus so

660
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,369
the throttle and the and the steering we

661
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,559
think are basically the same as the Kia

662
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,089
Soul so we can use the same approach

663
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:22,499
which is which is a good one

664
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:26,279
and the brake inside this car this is so

665
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,210
key is failing to be much more

666
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,999
sophisticated so I think this one comes

667
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:30,840
with auto emergency

668
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
breaking you can get with a radar and

669
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,740
things like that so and also hybrids

670
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,210
always have a break by wire interface

671
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,370
because they modulate they modulate the

672
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,500
breaks between a regenerative braking

673
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,780
from the electric motor and hydraulic

674
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,480
braking so what that means is that it's

675
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:54,480
a much more complex system on foot brake

676
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,570
which is easy to spoof but in but they

677
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,280
don't check that with a pressure sensor

678
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,110
in the master cylinder which is all

679
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,240
self-contained and on circuit board

680
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,940
traces so that's the problem so for this

681
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,710
guy we think that we have to have a can

682
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,690
interface typically those interfaces

683
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,950
don't exist so there's clearly some work

684
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,150
to do there anyway we can do this but

685
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,240
it's but it's non-trivial we're also in

686
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,200
the process of doing some real

687
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,870
Production Engineering on on this the

688
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,700
Kia Soul implementation that we build so

689
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,140
when we build a car we build it with

690
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,940
like a little bunch of power bus systems

691
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,520
and extra cabling and sensor pin outs

692
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,280
and bracketry so we're doing all the cab

693
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,470
modeling and and production work to get

694
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,350
ready to actually actually provide bombs

695
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,170
and full build specs for companies that

696
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,730
want to do this themselves we don't

697
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,050
really want to be a via car build

698
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,750
company but you know this stuff has to

699
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,130
be done and so if you're looking to

700
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,050
build a fleet as soon we will have full

701
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,820
production engineering done on that and

702
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,460
then finally you really want to partner

703
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,270
with with a 2-1 so if your two ones to

704
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,620
be in the audience we would love to

705
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,750
partner with you to build this into

706
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,490
someday so the hardware and it's not

707
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,100
ideal that it's hard we know in terms of

708
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,630
in terms of safety and resilience we

709
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,670
think that you know a little a little

710
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,890
ECU implementation on a Saudi Hardware

711
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,720
would be a would be a great move not

712
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,070
only for the project but also for the

713
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,710
companies that might be interested in in

714
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,900
building their own systems or there's

715
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,070
just a lot of a lot of good reasons to

716
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:30,540
contribute to that to this this is

717
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,100
pretty cool so we just partnered with

718
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,530
Udacity I would say this announcement is

719
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,610
anyone aware of the

720
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,820
self racing cars event in the US yeah

721
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,830
some people some racing cars is a

722
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,590
hilarious track day organized by a guy

723
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,390
named Joshua Schechter who started

724
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,750
delicious anyone remembers that

725
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,390
[Applause]

726
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,440
basically a whole bunch of startups in

727
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,870
the day come and and show off their

728
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,600
latest autonomous driving stuff on a

729
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,030
race course and and try and drive fast

730
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,040
so last year it was a total junk show

731
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,380
like nope like people the fastest laps

732
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,030
were like average 12 miles an hour or

733
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,780
something terrible because like Kia

734
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,080
Souls so we so this year I expected to

735
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,870
be much better if you're not as this

736
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,290
really cool program now where they're

737
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,420
training people to do they have their

738
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,670
self driving cars nanodegree so I

739
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,930
probably some people are in it here I'm

740
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,590
guessing and the and so they're gonna

741
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,810
organize me a set of teams that will

742
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,880
then come in and bolts into an ass to

743
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,790
ICC cars that we're providing and then

744
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,260
race them around but I raced them around

745
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,090
the track so this is the beginnings of

746
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,890
that type of interface for the

747
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,000
automotive industry we might have to

748
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,740
hack away to it but this is a big

749
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,660
message for the auto industry is like we

750
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,540
need interfaces that breeds innovation

751
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,600
and so you're we give you cars other

752
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,890
teams we've never seen them before are

753
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,660
gonna come bolt in and drive them really

754
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,040
faster on a racetrack there's nothing

755
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,370
wrong bad that could happen there right

756
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:06,210
here's a cool video from last year look

757
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,770
look at that guy yeah you get to dress

758
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,210
you know however you want

759
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,980
there's Flags there's this is this is an

760
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,950
idea that type of car is that that will

761
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,300
make available there if you aren't

762
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,950
sitting racing those cars you know or

763
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,840
you

764
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,730
please let me know afterwards and we'd

765
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,080
be able to get you in the running I

766
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
don't think it should just be Udacity

767
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
students that are able to do this so

768
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,450
this is the type of car that we provide

769
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,850
it's got a computers in the back and

770
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,200
here it is about to about to go out on

771
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,610
the track this is kind of gives you an

772
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,860
idea of how the event is here's slow-mo

773
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,590
we're not actually driving that fast yep

774
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,390
see been talking about it some more but

775
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,220
look how slow down I'm spinning which

776
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,300
I'm sure a lot of you if you're

777
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,770
developing self-driving cars would love

778
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,030
to get your hands on we'd be happy to

779
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,640
provide you not only data for for this

780
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,410
but also but also give you a chance to

781
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,840
get on the car and raced around or just

782
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,730
show up and hang out and see you know

783
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,620
see what the industry is doing in the in

784
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,830
their garage there's usually no big OEMs

785
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,239
or anybody at the or there shouldn't be

786
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,500
any big OEMs or anybody at this event

787
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:28,500
it's totally startups actual specific

788
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,770
kia soul build manual in the next a

789
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,110
couple weeks couple months then I'll

790
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,090
show you not only a sort of what wires

791
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,500
to cut and where to run them and all

792
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,159
that fun stuff

793
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,810
you can immerse engineer some canned

794
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,830
signals as I mentioned that's an

795
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,270
important thing that we need to get done

796
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,280
you can put any different cars if you've

797
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,380
got a car that you think you want to run

798
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,300
it on send us an you know and we will

799
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,280
tell you how to do that or you can try

800
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,630
and parse it from the docks but if you

801
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,969
just like still learning this stuff it

802
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,110
might be hard we're happy to help you

803
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,960
out place this we just evaluated kia

804
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,580
sportage it's not going to work

805
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,020
sorry so you know other cars on which

806
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,730
this works on that they've typically

807
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,030
simpler the car the cheaper the better

808
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,520
and extend the existing designs like

809
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,500
we're not electrical engineers we had

810
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,450
the the circuit board design site

811
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,950
contracted we think they're pretty good

812
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,350
we think they could be way better the

813
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,140
software as well so you know please get

814
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,270
in there and and and tell us what for

815
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,830
actually the great things the great

816
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,650
developments

817
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,279
like it's completely ruthless and has no

818
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,589
pity for you and so that we've gotten

819
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,910
some really critical comments that have

820
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,740
dramatically improved the quality of the

821
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,720
other repo already so that's been

822
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,369
awesome even with all contributions

823
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:46,960
that's super valuable that's all the

824
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,089
circuit boards and pictures and diagrams

825
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,880
all that fun stuff the phone wires gplv3

826
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,710
we really think that it should not be a

827
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,079
proprietary type thing if you don't

828
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,809
improve the firmware then that would be

829
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,730
great and we should definitely share

830
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,950
that but the software side we provide a

831
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,020
little joystick controller app that

832
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,700
doesn't require our framework or

833
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,309
anything like that policy and so that's

834
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:19,900
MIT and you know extend away place we

835
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,579
have not guaranteed at safety we're

836
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,079
trying to make something better but I

837
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,339
can the noahic and down you're using

838
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:27,940
this in you know in with your non

839
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,770
controlled environments without a safety

840
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,650
driver all these things so if you do

841
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,109
that you're taking your fate in your own

842
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,380
hands but it's probably better than

843
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,190
putting hobby servos on your car that's

844
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,500
it

845
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,849
[Applause]

846
00:36:51,950 --> 00:37:14,640
having have some time for questions so

847
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,710
that's part of why we open sources we're

848
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,300
not using it for commercial purposes

849
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,610
it's it's it's free for everybody so we

850
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,500
we have our lawyers have looked at that

851
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,710
and we believe that we are okay because

852
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,990
we are we are working on you know things

853
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,720
that we have freely bought in Lyon we

854
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,700
are we are not publishing any

855
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,230
proprietary information about the Kia

856
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,910
Soul in the cases where we need wiring

857
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,230
diagrams and things we manufacture those

858
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,040
ourselves so we believe that we're that

859
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,330
yes it's legal yes

860
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,610
[Applause]

861
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,060
sure alright so the question was this

862
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,200
gentleman sees this as a low-level

863
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,670
framework are we integrating with other

864
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,730
sensors and frameworks across poly sync

865
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,190
yes we provide lots of sensor drivers

866
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,500
record and replay facility we have we

867
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,320
bridge to loss to provide a stable

868
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,460
underlying sensor layer for that

869
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,890
framework this is just meant to be a

870
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,590
like a firmware like low level control

871
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,530
system so if you want to if you want to

872
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,060
extend it to a lot like the loss driver

873
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,780
for it please do yeah I play should pick

874
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,980
someone in the back was there how about

875
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:10,220
you we have talked about extending a cc

876
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,320
to be controlled by their you know Drive

877
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,020
pilot and common EO system and we poked

878
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,790
it poked at it ourselves that's another

879
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,230
thing like glass you know that'd be a

880
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,780
great thing to see the community - we're

881
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,530
not an applications company so they are

882
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,470
and how do we get funding Oh ACC as I

883
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,570
LSCC is unilaterally like good for our

884
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,700
business for as a platform company and

885
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,460
so we fund that side of the the product

886
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,109
freely like it's good for our engineers

887
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,080
- to learn more about about cars to

888
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,430
learn more about writing safety critical

889
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,950
code we think that it's great like it's

890
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,890
a it's a great thing for us to give to

891
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,140
the community and creates goodwill and

892
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,130
then we do make a little bit of money

893
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,650
off of it when we build cars for people

894
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,420
and we can ditch we do trainings and

895
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,190
things like that so we do that we do

896
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,839
that type of

897
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:12,849
Oh SEC but largely it's not meant to be

898
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:14,679
a revenue generator for us it's really

899
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,669
meant to be an enabler to have a

900
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:17,199
community and we think that everyone

901
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,729
will eventually grow up and want to use

902
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:34,839
Poli sink because they love us that's

903
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,299
that we do in Pali sink with much more

904
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:38,650
fidelity than that in terms of the

905
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,749
flight recorder for kin and there's

906
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,609
stuff out there for that you can log to

907
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,699
like SD cards and things like that so no

908
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:46,929
plans to do that but that would be a

909
00:40:46,929 --> 00:41:12,159
great a great project things need to be

910
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,089
tuned for every car so far so far for

911
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:17,679
Kia Souls we haven't had to do any

912
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,949
retuning of the PID so those seem to be

913
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,809
pretty consistent other cars certainly

914
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:24,279
would have to write so you'll just have

915
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:27,039
different ranges of sensors and things

916
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,159
like that that would require retuning it

917
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,169
was so yeah we try I think that we are

918
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:34,569
we had that stuff formally hard-coded

919
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:35,650
and we're playing it on the

920
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,569
configuration file so be able to do that

921
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:42,779
easier yeah good

922
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:49,029
yep

923
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,160
oh yeah okay sir yes but generally

924
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,190
giving me a chance to plug Polly sink

925
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:13,110
which is that which is that we and the

926
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,850
autonomous car those are things that we

927
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,070
enable through Polly sink we don't let

928
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,200
another application company so we don't

929
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,480
build sensor fusion we don't build our

930
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,490
generation algorithms this is meant to

931
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,200
be a completely low-level just give you

932
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:58,279
an interface where if you say go our

933
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,859
control on public roads we have closed

934
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,290
course control areas and there are two

935
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,450
one one was built for a startup that I

936
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,490
can't tell you it is in a bay area and

937
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,020
the other was built for a University of

938
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,940
Michigan for the EM City tract there

939
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:25,650
[Applause]
