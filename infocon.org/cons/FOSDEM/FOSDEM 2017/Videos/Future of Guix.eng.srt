1
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,920
so we're starting a little bit early

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,380
which which will confuse the people who

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,110
didn't video stream and we don't have a

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,259
mic which will confuse it even more you

5
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,930
can hear us right so I think it's a this

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,840
an idea of this panel is ready to get

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,090
some feedback from you we have from the

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,090
audience I mean we we know our ideas yes

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,580
we are severely entrenched but we have

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,680
the to do ideas and I think it would be

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,270
nice to get an idea of what the

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,000
priorities are right I mean if we look

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,580
at the future of geeks I think maybe you

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,220
know I can i I will say the deets is

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,130
already a success it is just the start

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,900
of it but it's it's amazing what is

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,430
happening and it's you know we can build

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,260
in it incrementally which is very good

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,870
for the future but what what should we

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,399
focus on next right I mean what's what's

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,019
gonna be was the most important thing

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,420
you think that is going to be you know

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,899
to drive

24
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:12,909
you know geeks in the future so maybe I

25
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,409
should talk to panel members first and

26
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,940
then you can react faster yep okay I

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,010
think I'm gonna start straight with a

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,330
conversation that we had a couple

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,380
so hey I think we have a we ever just

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,970
gave a whole round of applause we're in

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:39,399
first of all because yes our second year

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,289
of this like a sub conference right like

33
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,060
in the amount of energy and stuff in

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,330
this room is just nuts but I think so we

35
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,560
one of the things we were talking about

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,220
the other night

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,899
yes geeks is great the all monkeys but

38
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,670
getting them in the hands of users it's

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,319
not necessarily very easy right now

40
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,479
right one thing that I would love to see

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,819
is be able to do apt-get install geeks

42
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,649
or even young install geeks I guess if

43
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,110
you're on fedora or whatever right so

44
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,489
that one of the big blockers on this is

45
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,680
that we have this flash canoe thing and

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,569
it's not part of the filesystem

47
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:21,250
hierarchy standard yeah so I think that

48
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,500
so I guess the monologue this so maybe I

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,760
have to figure out to turn over the I

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,410
would really like to see geeks get

51
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,600
packaged in Debian or etc but you have

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,609
to get over this pass slash didn't even

53
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,570
not being a filesystem hierarchy

54
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,190
standard thing now we can do it one of a

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,959
few things we could just switch we can

56
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,209
switch over to /opt just abandon the

57
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,489
good thing is that I think that I'm

58
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,819
looking at Lu the game face we could and

59
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,650
and so maybe I should hand it over to

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,480
one of you two before I start just I

61
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,950
feel like I'm monologuing and I feel

62
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,680
rude about that on the family I'll

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,739
explain the so some of the ideas we came

64
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,930
up with are kind of successively crazy

65
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,459
well the first one is switching to op

66
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,769
that's not gonna happen the second one

67
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,450
is we can do basically what pewter

68
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,329
demonstrated today and just rewrite we

69
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,510
can substitute all packages including we

70
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,239
can basically do a graft of all stuff

71
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,069
that packages including all the

72
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,520
substitutes

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,430
I'll graph the packages and just rewrite

74
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,340
them all from slash canoes left storage'

75
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,960
slash op slash store and then that might

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,910
make it much easier to package in Debian

77
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,560
or etc the other crazy idea is to

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,600
possibly have a user name space I think

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,940
this was your idea where people just in

80
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,980
there dot accession or whatever end up

81
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,360
opening up to user name space that

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,660
basically Remax /opt slash store to

83
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,460
slash a slash store and that's kind of

84
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,840
getting crazier and then the last phrase

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,790
you want us to get it in the actual FHS

86
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,930
but I'm not sure that that's going to

87
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,870
happen so that was all there was a long

88
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,580
route to not really have Hamel kind of

89
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,410
conversation so I guess I'm gonna hand

90
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,550
it over to the rest of the group to say

91
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,250
how do you think that we can get geeks

92
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,270
better adapted in the world I should

93
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,010
point out that there I see a Debian

94
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,570
developers sitting there in the back of

95
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,640
the room so you know maybe for this

96
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,798
particular point we could also think

97
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,470
about the social approach to it I don't

98
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,570
know yeah so getting geeks into into

99
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,610
Debian another free district is one

100
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,420
thing I think I'm also personally

101
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,640
interested in having you know great use

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,460
cases for geeks so we've we've seen

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,100
talks and discussions about a few of

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,040
them so one of them is high performance

105
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,310
computing where I think people are

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,050
really needing it so it's really a niche

107
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,140
in terms of users but people are really

108
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,590
in need of a solution and geeks seems to

109
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,870
be satisfying in a number of ways so

110
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,020
that's one thing I'd like to push and

111
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,210
then we have these geeks SD thing which

112
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,690
is pretty cool I think and to make it

113
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,880
even cooler in a number of obvious cases

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,870
there is kids deploy and so chris has

115
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,450
been looking at it and before David

116
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,900
Thomson also started toying with a way

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,360
so I should say what geeks deploy is I

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,910
guess right so give the plug so you have

119
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,720
geeks SD where you run geek system

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,130
reconfigure geek system VM and you get

121
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,520
one machine right one operating system

122
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,310
instance and the idea with geeks deploy

123
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,080
is to

124
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,599
allow you to actually deploy gigs SD on

125
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,520
a number of machines like on a on a

126
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,819
cluster on the network something so for

127
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,759
those of you familiar with Knicks ups

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,919
this would be roughly the geeks

129
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,349
equivalent to Knicks ops that's that's

130
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,169
the idea and so I think the ability to

131
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,470
deploy a whole bunch of machines in a

132
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,840
reproducible fashion is really one of

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,970
the killer apps that we could have in

134
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,949
the fourth inning future it's hard to be

135
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,530
the third person to say something noble

136
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,020
so I work in as a system administrator

137
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,560
in an HPC environment so for me HPC is

138
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,159
kind of important not just personally

139
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,030
but I think if we can make people but

140
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,680
the system administrators realize that

141
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,139
geek solves their problems in scientific

142
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,960
computing and they pick it up once

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,780
they're unlikely to change away from it

144
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,639
again so for me this is a personal

145
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,029
priority to get adopted because as soon

146
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,690
as we have people in science depending

147
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,990
on geeks they cannot get away with not

148
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,300
supporting it this is how I ended up

149
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:08,550
supporting geeks I don't really know if

150
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,690
Epcot installed geeks is is really an

151
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,610
issue if this is really a problem

152
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,380
are they actually people who are

153
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,350
interested in geeks who shy away from

154
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,230
using it because they can't just apt-get

155
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:41,230
install Oh what yeah he's - oh okay so

156
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,900
what I would love to do is have media

157
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,550
goblins default way to get up and

158
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,430
running for is either that you have a

159
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,250
deaf package or like for Debian type

160
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,950
users but if you wanted to develop you

161
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,660
know for geeks users they'll obviously

162
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,640
already have it for kicks SD users right

163
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,080
but if you're developing on something

164
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,610
like Debian or Fedora or something like

165
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,080
that I would love people to be able to

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
do geeks environment geeks SEM right now

167
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,900
we have to either ask somebody to drop

168
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,090
this binary install thing which I think

169
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,980
is not very nice for a lot of people

170
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,200
like it technically works but there's

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,630
good reasons to feel uncomfortable doing

172
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,420
that right and like if I could just say

173
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,700
oh it's just like any of these other

174
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,290
package managers you can just install

175
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,480
out-of-the-box on Debian that would be

176
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,050
huge

177
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,910
like I could just say it's so easy to

178
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,160
just pick up geeks you have it already

179
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,549
right yeah that would be a I know for my

180
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,950
use cases at least a would be big it's

181
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,950
been a while since I use Debian but I

182
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,690
know that oh bun - people use what is it

183
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,440
called ppas

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,490
right that's a one-liner that you did

185
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,200
you execute to add an additional

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,720
repository that you trust and then you

187
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,790
can do apt-get install would that be

188
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,340
sufficient or does it really have to be

189
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,520
official I mean we could that's okay so

190
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,800
that's another option as well you know I

191
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,180
I mean I think that that's another

192
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,280
option to getting things installed but I

193
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,260
think it would be even better if we

194
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,000
could have geeks shipped with Debian

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,560
itself so that because not everybody is

196
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,910
going to want to edit their PPA list

197
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,060
yeah so the question it really is what

198
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,230
is the growth path that we are looking

199
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,660
for right I mean if you if you make it

200
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,860
easy for people to install software

201
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,660
that's one thing and I I agree with fish

202
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,589
that's possible the Debian community has

203
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,630
been highly resistant to you know

204
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,490
including package managers in their in

205
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,410
their systems if but they have package

206
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,790
managers you know for four languages

207
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,250
like PI pie and all that so you know you

208
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,560
I suppose it's it could be could be

209
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,910
worked on right but it's gonna probably

210
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,760
be a long haul beyond it the question is

211
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,140
also know what what type of use do you

212
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,760
want to attract I mean you really want

213
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,959
to attract users that start contributing

214
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,220
to gigs right which which said to be

215
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:23,320
people who develop software I mean the

216
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,640
other the other thing nose will say is

217
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,770
that what I really like the idea about

218
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,060
is this kind of thing that they were

219
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,410
taught something as long as it's more

220
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,540
fun is the container idea you know

221
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,089
system container which i think is be a

222
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,070
massive thing in terms of like well web

223
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,589
service development I guess were media

224
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,089
coping but also like for something I'm

225
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:41,410
doing it's just kind of anything that

226
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,029
requires multiple services to be running

227
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,770
will be lovely to just do it in the

228
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,360
container and I think there are

229
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,680
communities out there I definitely think

230
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,160
we I'm working in well it's still

231
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,360
looking for really nice development

232
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,149
environment but going to them and saying

233
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,920
okay you just need to kind of first set

234
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,600
up you know geeks in a complicated way

235
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,310
and that you can use this is amazing it

236
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,050
that basically

237
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,170
you know why change the current

238
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,489
development environment that they have

239
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,889
which works but it's a hassle for

240
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,540
another one that is also hassle and that

241
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,699
also works in many better ways but also

242
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,949
just works you know so I think in that

243
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,480
sense and those of you loved develop

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,660
software with also users and it's a

245
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,369
niche I think that that would definitely

246
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:27,670
we did fill so many of us talked about

247
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,049
how we love that geeks could be a

248
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,519
replacement for things like docker and

249
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,170
stuff like that right but we don't

250
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,230
expect that every user of docker has to

251
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,209
be a docker contributor in order to be

252
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,980
able to make use of those features which

253
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,389
i think is kind of ties in with what

254
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,579
you're saying so I I don't I don't think

255
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,709
that everyone should we want as many

256
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,139
people as possible to send us patches

257
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,730
and to learn scheme and stuff like that

258
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,899
but I don't think that it should be a

259
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,579
prerequisite for taking advantage of all

260
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,980
of geeks those things currently actually

261
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,410
this happens already many people send us

262
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:04,649
patches this is a good problem to have

263
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,839
but it actually is also a problem

264
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,299
because managing all these patches

265
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:14,910
making sure that nobody is left out

266
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,339
that's actually one of the points on our

267
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,439
list it is kind of hard to make sure

268
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,660
that people continue contributing when

269
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,799
their contributions don't end up being

270
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,540
part of geeks eventually maybe you want

271
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,220
to say something about this

272
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,700
because I lost well this is something

273
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,110
that the audience members can help with

274
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,780
right we we we could use help with

275
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,940
people reviewing patches on the list and

276
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,430
it reviewing a patch Kent for the first

277
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,460
time actually be as easy as assuming or

278
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,720
once you get the geeks development

279
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,210
environment set up actually trying to

280
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,310
apply the patch and just see if it works

281
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,070
on your system right and that doesn't

282
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,200
require a lot of scheme expertise and in

283
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,300
fact I think Ludovic and a few others

284
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,970
have had talks about plenty of people

285
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,800
don't have scheme expertise when they

286
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
start with geeks and pick it up as they

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,270
go right so that's a call out to people

288
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,800
in the audience that's something you can

289
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,860
do actually I want to make one more call

290
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,620
out for something that people can do to

291
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,210
develop to push along one of the things

292
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,340
that we talked about previously which is

293
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,280
making geeks deploy happen if anybody in

294
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,110
the audience is interested in getting

295
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,370
geeks SD running on like commodity VPS

296
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,890
hosting type things that would push

297
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,370
along our work tremendously and document

298
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,470
it and if you can do that that'll help

299
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,510
us move along in the server space

300
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,880
dramatically and that's something you

301
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
know I'm sure there are a number of

302
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
people in this audience whose skills

303
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,920
could have applied about is adding a

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,810
support to you know continues

305
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,150
integration systems like Travis yeah if

306
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,400
if people could just you know deploy a

307
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
package say Ruby you know run the

308
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,850
software do the testing run the testing

309
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,070
environments that would also be very

310
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,930
highly visible projects you know because

311
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,260
you know I think 50% developers an

312
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,430
open-source already actually using

313
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,880
Travis map

314
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,769
should we throw another one audience

315
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:22,540
yeah we can ask who is somebody have a

316
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,850
question about the future of the center

317
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,310
that they'd like to ask for a strongly

318
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,170
worded opinion the one thing that

319
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,480
matters in stores and the traffic's is

320
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,680
some installer that and what is it but

321
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319
the shell throw two baskets and run an

322
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:48,670
automated way so the people just

323
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,680
installing easy anxiousness and eat

324
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,420
something useful Eaton and Betty and I

325
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,680
think it would mean they would have to

326
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,019
manually his boxing and also perhaps

327
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,180
things like Travis it also useful for

328
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,430
peace you could just run it first and

329
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,719
name you won't

330
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,080
Yeah right so the question is about how

331
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,090
we could facilitate the installation of

332
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,120
gigs right yeah so currently if you're

333
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
using the the so called binary turbo

334
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,320
which is a pre-compile gigs you have to

335
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,280
then go to the manual and do each of the

336
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,110
steps one by one and make sure you don't

337
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,270
forget anything and that's yeah that's

338
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,040
kind of not super convenient and you're

339
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,930
suggesting that we should have a script

340
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,689
that does that by default though right

341
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,030
yeah and yeah that's probably a good

342
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,590
idea actually it's been discussed a

343
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,720
couple of times and I think we probably

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,240
should do it although there is the

345
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,520
department that you know we are shipping

346
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,400
a big binary which is already I mean I

347
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,780
can imagine that some people are not

348
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,540
comfortable with it and so if we also

349
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,790
tell them well just run this shell

350
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,290
script and don't worry it's gonna be

351
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,280
fine you know just the perception could

352
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,280
be pretty bad so it's a bit like curved

353
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,730
pipe SH right so we need to be careful I

354
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,600
think about this also can we get a quick

355
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,880
poll of the room I love to see how

356
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,740
people's experiences of getting up and

357
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,400
running with geeks /xs D I guess it

358
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,470
would be so here's the range that's

359
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,160
gonna be very good experience pretty

360
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,460
good and could use some work all right

361
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,520
so let's go with the very good comedy

362
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,810
hands go wait how many people are

363
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,280
running geeks or geeks those D can you

364
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,870
raise your hands on that first whoa

365
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,390
blocks okay all right now let's go for

366
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,990
the very good

367
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,769
yeah okay what that means that's a

368
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,149
that's a product now okay so now that's

369
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,810
six so that's uh okay geeks first very

370
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,310
good okay

371
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,280
pretty good okay how about could use

372
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,109
some work okay what about excess D which

373
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,089
i think is a different beast so very

374
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,280
good

375
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,790
how about pretty good

376
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,059
how about could use some work okay so I

377
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,760
think we're seeing that geeks st is

378
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,050
considerably harder right now my friend

379
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,240
calls deke says of the installation

380
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,800
experience Gentoo for adults so I'm just

381
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,950
gonna randomly pass it microphone yeah

382
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,550
so what's the next topic here my

383
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,320
experience this may have changed my

384
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,760
experience like it's the last of my

385
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,160
rotten geeks on Debian is now like over

386
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,830
a year ago the my experience was that

387
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,390
setting up geeks of Debian I found

388
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,059
easier but and kind of making sure all

389
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,440
the environment variables are set and

390
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,730
everything that works nicely

391
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,470
that is way harder geeks STD

392
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,570
installation controls bit tricky but now

393
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,760
it's running like it's you know I don't

394
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,540
have to worry about anything

395
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,790
that's absolutely that's I so the

396
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,900
publication's also a different makes me

397
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,600
what I did recipe for a Debian package

398
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,460
change that also for overdue and I just

399
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,810
build that

400
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,750
and install it so that's easier then

401
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,620
like you said it's easier to just go

402
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,510
geese as deep because everything just

403
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:42,270
works so nice one Keeks does take care

404
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,920
of a couple of environment variables for

405
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,990
packages that you install but that's not

406
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,970
sufficient right there's just just a

407
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,110
little bit of SSL stuff for example with

408
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,940
the look how yeah certificate

409
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:03,330
certificate right it only tells you

410
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,140
things for packages that have search

411
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,670
path specifications and is that not

412
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,130
right that's right thank you and this

413
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,630
doesn't cover everything

414
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,820
which means there's always some manual

415
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,480
intervention required and and that kills

416
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,420
it a bit so it my experience been but we

417
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,000
are using geeks as such on the cluster

418
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,350
on the cluster computing environment and

419
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,150
on workstations and I try to make sure

420
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,300
to provide a file that people can source

421
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,730
it sets up the environment variables

422
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,710
maybe we can provide something similar

423
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,330
to that I would really like to move away

424
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,070
from the need to do this manually

425
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,190
because it trips me up as well - well as

426
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,430
well

427
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,340
should have coffee so one one topic we

428
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,840
talked about talking about here that I

429
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,010
definitely want to make sure we don't

430
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,280
miss is about community I mean obviously

431
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,010
you know we're hoping that we can engage

432
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,810
with the community since we're have

433
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,300
community in front of us but I think

434
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,890
that there are some things that to me it

435
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,960
feels like we could do a lot better at I

436
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,330
don't think we're a sufficiently diverse

437
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,020
as we could be and I feel like they're

438
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,320
probably I mean my experience i've i've

439
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
worked with projects that have really

440
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,020
struggled in that regard and that have

441
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,280
done better than average you know and

442
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,190
and I and I think Lisp also has a

443
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,710
reputation for being like curmudgeon II

444
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,630
people who think they have everything

445
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,980
right and then that kind of pushes a lot

446
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,140
of people away and it's probably because

447
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,490
I mean we do have a lot of things right

448
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,350
and so it's I but I mean look at closure

449
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,360
and racket right now which are like

450
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,120
doing way better than like

451
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,850
traditionalists and we definitely could

452
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,860
be better I mean one personally one

453
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,150
thing that I think could be improved

454
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,210
things a lot is you know if we engage

455
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,130
specifically with some groups like

456
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,360
outreach ye or something like that

457
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,130
although that would require us having

458
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,970
the funds to do that but but I'm really

459
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,290
interested in what we can do to improve

460
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,350
community and then to lower the barrier

461
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,850
especially for the groups of people we

462
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,320
don't currently have I don't know where

463
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,620
to go from there but Ricardo coming so

464
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,140
so you save it in the main theater there

465
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,590
was a talk on how to improve all it just

466
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,550
access

467
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,860
and one of my favorites just since they

468
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,310
did is bringing other people into your

469
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,950
community by asking them to do YouTube

470
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,920
instructions because a lot of people

471
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,500
can't code but want to share their

472
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,870
experience using something as an

473
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:12,410
operator so you mean the project could

474
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,500
share videos giving instructions is that

475
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,660
what you if it was just to contribute

476
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,510
and a lot of times people will come and

477
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,870
say how can I help and you'll say well

478
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,480
unless you're a coder you can't help so

479
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,610
you never want to drive away effort and

480
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,650
so one thing that you can ask younger

481
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,920
people to do because it's part of their

482
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,980
culture

483
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,260
last one any more videos oh yeah yeah

484
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,660
precisely I had I had written an item

485
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,390
about sharing the workload it's all

486
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,310
about that all the kinds of tasks that

487
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,430
we have to do somehow and many of them

488
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,370
are non-technical like I mean we have

489
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,550
things like like the website like people

490
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,170
posting about what they are doing with

491
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,700
gigs which doesn't have to be you know

492
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,870
super sophisticated videos yeah that's

493
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,940
that's definitely one thing like to help

494
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,940
people discover gigs and discover what

495
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,460
it does what it's used for how it helps

496
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,670
and yeah I agree that we should yeah try

497
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,470
to make it easier to discover what

498
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,940
people can do in these areas

499
00:23:44,970 --> 00:24:10,059
very nice and well I was talking about

500
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,620
this with some with some other

501
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,200
individuals last night including Alex we

502
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,800
were talking about so one of the

503
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,620
problems is is that like for example

504
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,270
before like I got into geeks I hated dem

505
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,340
bugs like I hate it right like if that's

506
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,750
a bug tracking system we use and it's

507
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,830
like all email-based

508
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,840
right and like I was like and I was

509
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,400
trying to use the web interface to find

510
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
things and I'm like this is the worst

511
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
like this web interface is terrible like

512
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
how do I manage it well then I found out

513
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,260
that there's a great Emacs mode which is

514
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,020
what everybody else like it's just like

515
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,630
beautiful and it's like well now I don't

516
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,160
want to use anything else right so every

517
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,090
but like this is like a traditional

518
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,670
especially a new problem is if we have

519
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,160
all these things that like once you pass

520
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:02,230
this very high barrier to entry yeah

521
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,809
just like I promise you your love is

522
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,620
just one up this mountain it's very tall

523
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,140
but you don't feel so great when you get

524
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,500
to the top

525
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,790
[Laughter]

526
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,610
in using emails yeah I tried for three

527
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,920
times to get into Emacs for the third

528
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,270
time I I never got out in him you know

529
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,440
but the first few times I thought

530
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,450
everybody's talking about I should use

531
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,870
this too and it just didn't stick

532
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,430
because defaults matter as well and

533
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,220
actually I agree that departs could be

534
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,160
more discoverable I also find it hard to

535
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,980
use actually and I think I'm the target

536
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,340
audience yeah and the male based

537
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,220
workflow that we have sending in patches

538
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,020
it does well it does have a lot of

539
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,390
advantages one of which is that you do

540
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,570
not need to have some account on some

541
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,970
web application we have to log in and

542
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,150
then click around and do things you can

543
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,710
just send an email well this is great

544
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,960
about it it also makes it hard to keep

545
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,540
track of things it makes it hard to keep

546
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,309
track of patches that you've sent in

547
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:22,440
because it but you can integrate this

548
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,179
with org-mode I guess and right but I I

549
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,370
agree that this there's a need for

550
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:34,050
something that combines those two worlds

551
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,910
that makes it possible that we don't

552
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,120
have to change too much in the way that

553
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,910
our established workflows work for us

554
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,620
and that other people find it

555
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,010
discoverable as well yes this is

556
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,280
actually quite amazing because geeks is

557
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,890
as a system as a packaging system is is

558
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,200
really approachable you know it's it's

559
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,520
much easier than doing that bein

560
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,710
packaging I dabbled in that too and I

561
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,620
gave up no yeah so the best thing about

562
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,090
Jesus is you actually can write packages

563
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,700
quite you know low-profile easily get it

564
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,220
done get it tested and run but then you

565
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,390
hit the barrier because you have to

566
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,050
submit it to you know the the trunk and

567
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,490
I've you know I've successfully got some

568
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,260
packages in so I'm proud enough to say

569
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,770
that it works but you know it's I find

570
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,300
it so hard and tedious that I'd actually

571
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,950
don't do it at this point and the

572
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,960
question really to to to the maintainer

573
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,760
of geeks is you know can we not find a

574
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,230
way

575
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,620
that we you know please both please both

576
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,870
audiences one is the you know the highly

577
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,940
professional I should say one good has

578
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,169
gone over the mountain you know and

579
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:37,640
they're there happily above there

580
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,380
somewhere but there's also people that

581
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,720
you know just you know would like to use

582
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,299
something like github yeah submit a

583
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,280
patch have somebody look at it you know

584
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,260
and and get some response

585
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,179
it doesn't necessarily even have to go

586
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,160
into into into mainline yeah the point

587
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,020
really is that you want to get make it

588
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,690
easy for people to get comments and

589
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,309
encourage them actually to to continue

590
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,840
working on those patches until the point

591
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,010
that they actually ready to get it to

592
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,080
trunk so part of the challenge with this

593
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,570
is that this is a boy would be great to

594
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,640
have a big complicated tool that doesn't

595
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,190
exist and like everybody is busy in the

596
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,870
community already with our own big

597
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,820
complicated tools that do exist and take

598
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,850
a lot of work right so like so I know

599
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,980
that I remember I can't remember what it

600
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,530
is it's a Conservancy like software

601
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,960
hosting thing you know I'm talking about

602
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,270
they like they were really interested in

603
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,040
having something that both has an API

604
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,480
that you could like use an Emacs and

605
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,400
stuff but that also has like a web

606
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,570
interface and stuff like that but like

607
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,910
that project doesn't have like also I

608
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,990
don't know if it has a lot of momentum

609
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,559
right now so like kallithea I think

610
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,500
that's it right now so like these things

611
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,870
are really important and useful right

612
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,000
now we're stuck between choices that

613
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
seem very binary right like they're

614
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,860
either you've got a very I don't know

615
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,890
what the answer is for that yeah so

616
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,440
regarding tooling I think there's a kind

617
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,570
of a cultural issue I mean it's it's

618
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,559
pretty clear that I mean some of us are

619
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,179
kind of used to their current workflow

620
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,799
and everything so it makes it harder to

621
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,760
move to something else in general that

622
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,380
said I mean I can understand that it's

623
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,720
it's not necessarily trivial it's like

624
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,090
that big mountain definitely for people

625
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:25,309
not used to it so yes what option would

626
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,799
be to use to have some sort of in like

627
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,660
an instance of gitlab that we could use

628
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,250
and test drive you know we don't have

629
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,710
maybe to switch directly to something

630
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,320
but we could try out something right and

631
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,140
maybe have two systems at the same time

632
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,999
while we figure out how

633
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,619
things work and whether it's good for us

634
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:46,039
and I've been told by a

635
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,799
Animax person that gitlab is not that

636
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,739
bad even for for the kind of person like

637
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,839
me who likes to do things in Emacs and

638
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,089
have email and stuff so I don't know

639
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:59,479
maybe maybe it's an option I I guess we

640
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,239
just need to try out and yeah please

641
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,429
yeah it's also about you know trying out

642
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,499
another tool and that's quite a lot of

643
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:10,699
work also so that's not people so yeah I

644
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,819
mean you know why not have two systems

645
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,589
and one cold one

646
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:18,559
you know the incubator or or the teacher

647
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,359
or the helper you know where people

648
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,399
actually learn and it could actually be

649
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,719
managed by different people it doesn't

650
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:28,639
have to be the same thing right this is

651
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,049
I think you're talking more about

652
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,489
processes then tools right yeah I think

653
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:37,369
we'd I mean if when someone post patches

654
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,949
is the remaining list sauce definitely

655
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,719
way too often it takes time to get an

656
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:44,929
answer I completely agree but most of

657
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:47,029
the time there are people who try to do

658
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:51,259
some sort of mentorship and it's I think

659
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,129
it's it's quite good I would say but

660
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,319
obviously it doesn't really scale also

661
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,649
and I mean just just because we have two

662
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,629
different tools or two different repos

663
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,639
let's say doesn't mean that there will

664
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,529
be double the number of people to

665
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:09,139
actually do that work and that's that's

666
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,969
yeah that's a scalability issue we also

667
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,409
don't want to end up in a situation

668
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:17,299
where we have to completely destroying

669
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,529
systems that are very important yeah so

670
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,599
wait do we want to jump onto it I feel

671
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,429
like we've covered that one pretty well

672
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:32,389
do we have to I mean I mean it's not

673
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:33,979
just a useful like doing business this

674
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,169
is a hard problem like Debian has is to

675
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,269
work but also like you know the project

676
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,979
that are working it work like we've got

677
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,719
a bug tracker and there are tons of

678
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,119
patches that just sit there and just

679
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,259
people gonna get around to them and

680
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,069
especially people who are not

681
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:47,899
necessarily like who's first patches it

682
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:48,919
is we're not really known in the

683
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:50,629
community like this is kind of element

684
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:52,159
of like you know someone never you kind

685
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,149
of might look at the patch earlier

686
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:54,469
there's that element that's kind of just

687
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:56,329
part of like large projects see these

688
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,369
are to a certain extent tools definitely

689
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,869
help so we need to investigate this

690
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:04,190
video a little vanities and I do think

691
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,709
that it is it is easy sometimes to kind

692
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,599
of obsessed over believing that tools

693
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,279
will fix the problem and that's not

694
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,359
necessarily true

695
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,099
I mean I do think we should be working

696
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,019
on it right but like I mean media

697
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,429
Gravlin has a lot of issues in its

698
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:17,989
tractor and it has a web interface bug

699
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:20,089
tracker right and we and if you the

700
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:22,519
average github repository has no

701
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,379
shortage of the issues and pull requests

702
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,269
right so I mean we there's a lot we can

703
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:28,249
do to make it easier but of course it's

704
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:32,149
easy to kind of put so much faith and if

705
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,799
we can only get better tools and that

706
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,029
especially happens with programmers

707
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:37,389
right because we love tools right it so

708
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,729
but a lot of it is also social - it's

709
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:42,709
there and it's not one or the other it's

710
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,459
both I think

711
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,909
should we at the the next language to FA

712
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:36,169
s on top of the gal ritual machine yeah

713
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:38,029
so the question is about how we can

714
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,580
avoid overlap between Nixon and Geeks or

715
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,779
share sharing work here that's a

716
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,799
difficult question because I mean so

717
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,210
does the low-level part is the same

718
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,490
right so in theory we have derivation

719
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,409
and Nix has derivation and that's the

720
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,740
same thing but then it's not just a

721
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,260
technical issue right like geeks is

722
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,179
building a fully free distribution for

723
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,039
instance whereas next pkg is doing

724
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,320
something different which is I mean an

725
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,330
important project also but you know we

726
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,820
have different thing on different views

727
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,159
and how to do things like even packaging

728
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,699
or that kind of thing so we can we

729
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,679
cannot ignore this part of the problem

730
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,190
right it's not just technical but then

731
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,800
yes I definitely think that we should at

732
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,500
the very least share ideas if not code

733
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,010
we are we actually already share code I

734
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,139
mean we've been using the build daemon

735
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,310
from NYX and it's it's wonderful I mean

736
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,780
geeks wouldn't exist without NYX in the

737
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,139
first place right but yeah sharing ideas

738
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,599
at the very least is something we can do

739
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,510
and it's it's cheap right and I'm sure

740
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,369
we have a lot to learn from each other

741
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:52,010
and we geek people have a lot to learn

742
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,790
from NYX

743
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,099
obviously because NYX OS and NYX ups is

744
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,040
more mature so yeah we should talk more

745
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,550
I would say

746
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,320
you you had a questions and we add a

747
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,700
confusing

748
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,819
[Music]

749
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,859
but I think oh that the

750
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:36,538
guarantee this

751
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,209
so

752
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,630
so Frida's of javascript is definitely a

753
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:54,340
concern of mine i the what a lot but

754
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,290
part of the problem is is if the web is

755
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,780
also a large ocean that I don't have a

756
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,250
lot of control over how much of it it

757
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,060
has free JavaScript Gina so I mean you

758
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,100
know I guess the best thing you could do

759
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,690
in that circumstance is contact them and

760
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,610
encourage them to free their JavaScript

761
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,470
or you know submit it to a meeting upon

762
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,720
instance or something but but anyway are

763
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,200
there other questions

764
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,209
[Music]

765
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,089
all right so yeah I have mixed feelings

766
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,919
because right so the question is about

767
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,739
how how about having tools in geeks SD

768
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,419
that would allow you to quickly hack

769
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:07,369
something as opposed to having to run

770
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:11,749
give system reconfigure right yeah so I

771
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,660
think you know the functional a hundred

772
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,239
percent reproducible model is inherently

773
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,669
very static and a bit rigid to why I

774
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:25,400
mean we do geek system reconfigure

775
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,439
because we want to make sure we have the

776
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:30,289
exact same system as if we had install

777
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,660
from scratch right but at the same time

778
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,079
I'm also a big fan of geyser and ripples

779
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,559
and life hacking and I'm also not fully

780
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,299
satisfied with the fact that we have to

781
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:42,739
go through this process every time we

782
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,209
just want to make a single change I

783
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:46,969
would like to have something like if

784
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,859
you're familiar with zmax like control

785
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,839
meter X which means evaluate this

786
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:55,249
expression right now but I I mean it's a

787
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,469
hard problem I don't know how to merge

788
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:02,630
the two requirements so I mean I agree

789
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,599
with you we need something I just don't

790
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,279
know exactly what it should look like

791
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,820
I can only say that in my experience so

792
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,180
far I really like to reconfigure things

793
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,720
I always do you're talking about X's D

794
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,410
right I've never actually hacked on the

795
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,290
operating system as it is in the store

796
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:39,900
in order to create some effect you know

797
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,329
because I really like the guarantees

798
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,710
that a reconfigured system gives me this

799
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,029
is what always annoyed me about

800
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:50,729
traditional system configuration is that

801
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,680
the you make a change here and you make

802
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,259
a change there and then you start

803
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:58,200
forgetting exactly what has changed and

804
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,359
you try to recreate this and there's

805
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,019
just no way to to be sure that you've

806
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:07,789
recreated the the exact same steps and I

807
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,470
feel that this should be a thing of the

808
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,420
past

809
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,079
so if reconfiguration is considered an

810
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,900
obstacle the we would have to figure out

811
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,869
why that is is it too slow

812
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:28,970
can we make it faster I'd rather not

813
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:34,289
soften the and of the boundaries that we

814
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:40,759
have but let's just me personally no I

815
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:44,609
do however hack on on packages that were

816
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:46,499
already build because sometimes

817
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:48,719
rebuilding everything from sourcing you

818
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,519
know that there's really just one it's

819
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,200
like it emails Nathan move in you're

820
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,029
hacking or new max and you really just

821
00:39:54,029 --> 00:40:02,279
want to play with what's there I I did

822
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:03,150
that before

823
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,670
just making the store right again

824
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,558
but I don't do this regularly alright

825
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:25,829
I can understand the desire to do this

826
00:40:25,829 --> 00:41:05,440
it goes against everything that we as an

827
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,440
example are built from Hydra dot org so

828
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,569
it's not raining geeks SD because it

829
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,519
dates back to the days where you could

830
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:15,000
barely install packages with geeks and

831
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,380
so it's running twist call I think and

832
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,329
we've been hacking around and that

833
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,769
machine to the point that we don't

834
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,960
really know what's going on there and so

835
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,839
we're finally switching to a new bit far

836
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,849
from ten which is called Bayfront which

837
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:29,740
is running geeks SD right from the start

838
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,660
and I can tell that yes having

839
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,190
everything under version control is is

840
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,430
wonderful

841
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,130
silly about the peer to peer project and

842
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,490
it's phenom yeah and the idea of package

843
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:55,520
chain and which is the irrationality

844
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,000
detective unit stuff right yeah so yes

845
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,220
so the question is about sharing

846
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,450
packages over in a b2b a fashion so

847
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,690
there was a G sock project on this topic

848
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,480
about using glue nets file sharing

849
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,840
components and pushing binaries to glue

850
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,930
net instead of using HTTP basically and

851
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,810
that's I think that something many of us

852
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,720
still want to see happening but it's

853
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,760
just that technically there are still

854
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,390
obstacles one of them is that new net

855
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,580
doesn't yet have a stable release

856
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,310
process so that makes things a bit more

857
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,380
difficult right but yeah for instance

858
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,350
during ji-suk the student world bindings

859
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,380
for this for goo net guy bindings and

860
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,840
also some sort of a proof of concept

861
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,880
that would allow you to push binaries to

862
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,160
blue net and to kind of retrieve them

863
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,230
but it was yeah poof of concept and

864
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,480
again as glue net is currently a moving

865
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,570
target we don't seem to be able to make

866
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,350
much progress on this ones I think we're

867
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,030
technically over time but maybe but we

868
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,460
can still excuse having at least one

869
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,930
more question that probably goes to

870
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,810
Ludovic more than anyone but you know no

871
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,160
wait literally amber caudill your book

872
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,380
maintainer x' but I see 1.0 in 2017 on

873
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,260
there what do we need next to get to 1.0

874
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,330
whatever what are what are the next

875
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,420
steps

876
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:39,469
I can just read it no one thing that is

877
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:42,739
I think we would all agree is bad about

878
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:48,349
keys at this point is geeks pull and

879
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:50,449
it's also because none of us are using

880
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:54,170
it so we don't feel the pain as often as

881
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,170
we should to change it and geeks pole

882
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,699
needs to become better gigs Paul is a is

883
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:16,430
anyone using gigs pull here Keeks Paul

884
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,890
is very naive implementation right now

885
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,249
it gets the latest version of geeks

886
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:25,400
compile that and creates assembling so

887
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,930
that the version of geeks you are using

888
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,609
is the latest version actually not even

889
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:29,859
true

890
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:37,549
pop part of that yeah

891
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:42,670
so for 1.0 gigs Paul should be extended

892
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,190
such that not only it becomes actually

893
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,180
usable but we've been thinking about

894
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,849
this a lot we've discussed this a lot

895
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:55,940
that we would like to be able to go back

896
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,449
in time with gigs so that you can say I

897
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,859
would like to have gigs at this

898
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:03,529
particular version without having to use

899
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:06,440
low-level tools like git and checking

900
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,309
out an old version and running make

901
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,199
there and then using that to build an

902
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:13,789
old version of a piece of software that

903
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:16,670
was available in geeks s history it

904
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,329
should be the front end for that so you

905
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:22,279
can have multiple versions of geeks that

906
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:25,309
you can switch to and from and that

907
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:27,410
relates closely to the idea of having

908
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,979
channels

909
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,270
geeks to geeks poles credit I think it's

910
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,650
not obvious how bad it is to most users

911
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,570
but that's also to its detriment that

912
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,640
they don't know how bad things are under

913
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,109
the hood and how much they should be

914
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:52,190
worried okay I shouldn't say yeah just

915
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,310
so just to give an idea of how bad it is

916
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,700
but I mean fortunately it's not just our

917
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,440
problem it's a problem that we share is

918
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,660
pretty much any project that uses get

919
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,510
nowadays which is that geeks pool is

920
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,000
essentially fetching stuff from kids but

921
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,590
it does not authenticate what it's

922
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,840
fetching all right so like we're

923
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,940
fetching from savanah but if there's a

924
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,010
man-in-the-middle attack you're fetching

925
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,780
a different set of packages and you

926
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,430
don't even notice right and that's

927
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,920
that's a bit of a problem but it turns

928
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,140
out that everyone has this problem with

929
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,560
kids I mean so there is work people are

930
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,030
starting to realize that it's kind of a

931
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,080
problem we need to be able to

932
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,000
authenticate checkouts but there is no

933
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,740
simple solution right that's the next

934
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,800
item on the list perfect so that's

935
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,720
that's something we need to work on and

936
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,840
for example people these two people have

937
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,180
been looking at I mean there is this

938
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,330
thing called the update framework Guf

939
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,780
and it's great but it's really biased

940
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,300
towards these tools that have you know

941
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,670
source on one hand and binaries and

942
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:12,220
repos on the other hand like in
