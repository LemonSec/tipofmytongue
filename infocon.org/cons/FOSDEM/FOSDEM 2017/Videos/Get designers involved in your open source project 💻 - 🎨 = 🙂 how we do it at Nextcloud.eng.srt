1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,020
so I thought

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,430
I'm going to talk about how to get

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,160
designers involved in your project so a

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,370
bit a bit even more basic than then

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,730
result before so yeah I also work on

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,460
next cloud and the design team since a

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,970
long time already

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,020
yeah so the short story of how to get

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,540
designers involved is basically go to

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,238
open sources and I've met slash jobs and

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,940
post what you need on the job board on

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,730
our job board of the open source design

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,340
collective but the long story is a bit

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,620
longer and I'm going to use examples

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,360
that we learned from working on next

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,380
cloud and that I also learned from

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,810
working in other communities and it's

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,079
very very basic things which have a lot

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,120
of impact so can have a show of hands

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
how many people work on an open source

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,950
project ok how many of you do not have

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:07,570
any designer involved in that project ok

23
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,319
this would be very useful for you but

24
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,210
this will also be very useful for people

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,920
who are designers who work on a project

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,079
and you want to improve so even though

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,299
it's kind of where I consider them very

28
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,729
basic things or I keep repeating them in

29
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,619
projects I think a lot of people or a

30
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,420
lot of projects they'll don't do them so

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,920
yeah you see them just a small word

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,780
about next cloud you might have heard

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,850
about the whole own cloud next art fork

34
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,090
so short story next cloud as a community

35
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,789
fork of a lone cloud because we were

36
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:42,499
unhappy with some things for example

37
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:44,840
that not everything was open source and

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,259
yeah bunch of other things so yeah you

39
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,560
can ask me later about it but anyway

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,020
this next out is like an open source

41
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,689
alternative to Dropbox and Google

42
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,399
products for files and contacts calendar

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,599
email video chat stuff like that so it's

44
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,729
quite an extensive project you already

45
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,720
heard about

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,119
maintains the calendar or commenting for

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,100
calendar as designer so yeah we have a

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,350
bunch of components and there's lots of

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,490
things that we learned during the years

50
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,030
so first thing of four basic things is

51
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,150
to establish a culture of design so I

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,819
was back when it was still on cloud I

53
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,860
was like the fourth or a fifth

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,080
contributor and I was the first designer

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,350
in the in the project and yeah it was

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,890
yeah very few people and there wasn't

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,840
even a company yet and yeah it was just

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,350
like a few people hacking on at a table

59
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,930
and stuff so the first thing very first

60
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,450
thing I did because I come from a design

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,160
background and not from like a

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,950
programmer or open-source background

63
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,690
very first thing I did was look at this

64
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,400
and say what the is this so this

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,080
you can even see like I had trouble

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
fitting it on the slide because there's

67
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,769
so much stuff on it and so misaligned

68
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,110
and yeah that's the that's the own cloud

69
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,410
one installation so yeah it's I mean I

70
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,820
could point out like what's wrong with

71
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,000
it like alignment of the fields of the

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,579
field labels to the left the password

73
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,320
you need to retype the password it's

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,329
it's pretty much a drag you need to

75
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,980
choose the data directory or you can

76
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,930
change it which I don't even care about

77
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,130
force SSL like just do it all this stuff

78
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,079
like date format what does even like

79
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,230
what is G even mean I have no clue

80
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,000
probably you can tell me but I don't

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,720
even care

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,540
and then one of my biggest problems with

83
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,210
the whole thing is the database

84
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,360
like I remember whole nightmares of

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,150
copying and finding database credentials

86
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,360
somewhere in some weird other subfolder

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,750
or asking my web host for that and even

88
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,750
with like a bit of nerdy skill that was

89
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,980
difficult so um there is also like a

90
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,050
technical choice to usability and some

91
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:14,230
sort and the the or that being how it

92
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,640
looks like now that's installation now

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,920
you see there is no database filled 34

94
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,738
because we use SQLite by default it's

95
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,110
not only percent advised to use it for

96
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,030
big installations but that allows us

97
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,940
because SQLite if you know it or not

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,010
know it it's just a simple single file

99
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,560
and you don't need any you don't need to

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,020
create any username password credentials

101
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,280
or whatever it can all be done by the

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,170
web server so it's a technical decision

103
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,630
that allows us to actually make it so

104
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,490
simple you just need to choose an admin

105
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,500
username password we could just also

106
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,180
like directly log you in and give you

107
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,590
the credentials I have default

108
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,450
credentials but that would result in a

109
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,669
lot of insecure installations so we

110
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,210
don't do that but yeah we we make it I'd

111
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,680
like to sing even simpler than the

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,910
WordPress 5-minute install and yeah this

113
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,830
but you can still change storage

114
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,710
database so you can still modify two

115
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,270
things one is the database so you can

116
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,340
change it to MySQL or PostgreSQL or

117
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,580
whatever you want whatever you implement

118
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,700
and then also to you can change the

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,610
storage path so that you can store it

120
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,010
somewhere else and all the rest is just

121
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:27,090
done automatically so yeah so it's just

122
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,500
it's basically this is very similar to

123
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,540
just the login screen actually and

124
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,640
that's very simple that still though

125
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,890
leaves you with you need to download it

126
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,510
you need to set the permissions and

127
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,760
stuff like that so you always need to

128
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,650
know that in open source we have this

129
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,570
additional problem we don't have a

130
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,220
sign-in button on the page

131
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,740
download button right so that's a it's a

132
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,220
very very different thing so yeah but

133
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,290
that gets easier in some sort also

134
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,350
technical reason with PHP 7 I think at

135
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,670
least because you don't need to mess

136
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,530
around with permission so much anymore

137
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,720
or on certain servers so a lot of

138
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,840
technical things interweave with the

139
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,420
design decisions or with how the UX is

140
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,340
at the end and in this case you access

141
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,710
of course the user experience of admins

142
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,220
installing the software ok so that's the

143
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,830
first thing and I think I've been

144
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,450
talking so long about it and because I

145
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,010
think it's so important that the setup

146
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,200
process is easy because that's the first

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,470
the first reason people turn around and

148
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,230
don't use your project like website and

149
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,410
and the installation process I would say

150
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,360
next thing is you have to care about

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,740
details so for example here colleague of

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,290
mine is actually more of a developer but

153
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,960
does a bit of front-end and yeah you

154
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,820
open that issue or we we basically did

155
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,590
it together at every nita

156
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,440
we now do we have four meetups during

157
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,780
the year they're like planning meetups

158
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,430
or working meetups for a next version

159
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,470
and they're open so everyone can

160
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,650
actually attend and what we establish

161
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,080
during these meetups is that we sit in a

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
meeting room and we install the the

163
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,720
newest version or the the current

164
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,540
development version and we we just click

165
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,370
through it as if we were like people

166
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,140
need to the project and we just point

167
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,630
out every single small thing so you see

168
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,260
like there's like wrong capitalization

169
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,840
for example or white space issues or or

170
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,660
some icon errors like it's white instead

171
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,890
of black and stuff like that it's very

172
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,060
very detailed things so um that

173
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,460
establishes a general culture of design

174
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,010
a general culture of the you probably

175
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,780
heard about the no broken windows policy

176
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,360
so if you yeah if you don't see anything

177
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,330
wrong then you are also less inclined to

178
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,450
do wrong choices or or you you you

179
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,700
encourage people to to do similarly

180
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,890
nice-looking things and so that's that's

181
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,889
very important to to

182
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,270
you do that with everyone and everyone

183
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,770
is in that room like all the developers

184
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,050
or the other people working on it so

185
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,900
yeah it just brings everyone together on

186
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,870
that design experience base second thing

187
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,060
is be informative so what does it mean

188
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,819
it's basically some things such as

189
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,469
simple as just putting screenshots in

190
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:18,389
your review in your in your repository

191
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,849
we meet and like a lot of projects I

192
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,210
look at I go through their github or to

193
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,039
their good lab or to the repository

194
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,199
anywhere and they don't even have any

195
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,909
screenshots even though it is an app

196
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,539
which probably has an interface and

197
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,370
there's like a ton of explanation and

198
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,760
it's like it looks like oh we use like

199
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,990
PostgreSQL and some blah blah blah

200
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,659
cluster with some angularjs and I don't

201
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,219
even care about that when I want to use

202
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,519
it so basic thing just a short

203
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,829
explanation like even even those tags I

204
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,490
mean are a bit nerdy but that's okay so

205
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,920
just short explanation and just a nice

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,380
screenshot so people can understand what

207
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,339
they're actually looking at so that's

208
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,709
one very small thing so the people who

209
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,529
raised their hands if you don't do that

210
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,649
yet please do that now and because this

211
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,720
is kind of this is also similar to the

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,279
website so if you don't have a website

213
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,440
you just have a repository do this if

214
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,300
you have a website make sure your

215
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,209
website has short explanation and a

216
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,490
screenshot but most projects don't have

217
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,760
a website yet so just do this next we

218
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,089
scroll down in the readme and then we

219
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,279
need a some kind of a concise feature

220
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,110
list explaining what the hell this

221
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,199
actually does so we have some funny

222
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,980
emojis also part of design and we just

223
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,649
list some features or some important

224
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,050
functionality of the app and explain

225
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,910
what it does and then we even have some

226
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,880
more nerdy info like we say yeah if you

227
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,990
want to if you want to send encrypted

228
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,880
the emails just use this browser

229
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,310
extension and yeah which libraries we

230
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,440
use for example just for developers who

231
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,529
also want to get involved and also what

232
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,190
we have planned for the coming versions

233
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,290
so it's kind of like yeah being

234
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,759
informative and being open about your

235
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,329
process then we scroll down even more

236
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:13,379
and the problem is always like yeah

237
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,149
oftentimes people or projects don't even

238
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,819
have any set up info like how the hell

239
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,399
do I do I make this thing run like I

240
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,500
just downloaded and then what right you

241
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,629
just clone the git repository which is

242
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,310
already pretty difficult for many people

243
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,220
and then yeah I'm just left there and I

244
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,980
see like an installed SAH and I see like

245
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,899
a grunt file or some like that

246
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,329
and I'm just really confused about what

247
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,300
what I what I need to do next and so the

248
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,769
one important thing is do not assume

249
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,540
that everyone knows what they need to do

250
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,509
with a make file or what they yeah what

251
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:47,800
they do need to do if they see a make

252
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,389
file or something like that just write

253
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,449
it out and make sure that it's yeah very

254
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:55,149
few commands so I'm actually I'm

255
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,889
actually still complaining about this

256
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,069
like about two commands so like if it

257
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,319
can be like just make it make or I mean

258
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,569
nothing at all would be best but if it

259
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,069
actually needs to be just make it one

260
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,560
command because this I always forget

261
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,600
like what what I actually need to type

262
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,769
and yeah so yeah that's also another

263
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,170
important thing make for for people who

264
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,199
are actually want to contribute and who

265
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,069
are a bit more technical maybe or less

266
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,680
technical but would like to learn just

267
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
spell it out like just write it out and

268
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,370
and those are yeah the three important

269
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,750
things in the readme actually I would

270
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,410
say then third part we also mention it

271
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,439
same same thing be welcoming and I I

272
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,540
like to repeat it because it's super

273
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,240
important and I'd like to think that

274
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,029
this is one of the big reasons why the

275
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,290
next design team is so successful the

276
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,920
the first thing for example is tying

277
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,500
into the whole make or grant file or

278
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,660
whatever thing is that you need to

279
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,790
remove barriers to entry for example we

280
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,339
have this issue or we have this this

281
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,889
thought forever like oh should we have

282
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,410
some CSS preprocessor CSS in this case

283
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,470
also regarding

284
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,070
right so like we could talk about like I

285
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,200
don't know using using composure for PHP

286
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,990
which which we also do in some parts but

287
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,300
this specifically is about the CSS so it

288
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,360
also concerns front end designers and so

289
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,770
one thought was yeah do we use s CSS and

290
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,150
we were discussing about it in the past

291
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,100
already and we're saying I know we

292
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,420
didn't really want to use it because

293
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,580
like then people need to compile it and

294
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,250
then this one contributor said well

295
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,040
there is this PHP library which directly

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,750
compiled it and the next Club being a

297
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,850
PHP app you don't need to do anything

298
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,300
else

299
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,790
right so actually it's it's seamless so

300
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,920
and I said okay if you can do it like

301
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,050
that if you can if you provide a pull

302
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,820
request and if you make it if you

303
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,880
rewrite it and if you make it so that it

304
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,680
just works then that's okay but

305
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,210
otherwise it's a barrier to entry and

306
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,640
that's not okay so yeah we're on a good

307
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,830
way like this issue is still partly open

308
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,960
but most of it actually is moved already

309
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,740
and yeah it's it's very cool with the

310
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,930
yeah with the additional bonus of not

311
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,300
making it any more difficult except you

312
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,240
know the s CSS syntax is like I mean

313
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,940
it's almost the same as CSS but it's

314
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,830
it's very easy very easy to learn it's

315
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,410
like not an entirely new technology so

316
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,510
you can have some optimizations or you

317
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,580
can have some cool tools but you would

318
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,320
still need to keep in mind that it needs

319
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,370
to be simple then second thing we also

320
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,080
mention I'm very happy that it's

321
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,140
successful or that it works is to tags

322
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,110
that we use or yeah we use many tags but

323
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,450
these I think are one of the most

324
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,190
important ones or two of the most

325
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,170
important ones for open source projects

326
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,750
in general one is the design tag it's

327
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,910
just like an umbrella tag for everything

328
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,880
regarding interface design UX design any

329
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,910
kind of design we just chose the tag

330
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,400
design I actually got it from Mozilla

331
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,040
where they use 13 different tags I think

332
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,980
like UX feedback so if there's missing

333
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,590
feedback or if there's a spinner showing

334
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,170
too long then UX wording I think when

335
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,850
the when the language is too technical

336
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,180
or not understandable so we just grouped

337
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,160
it to one design tag because that makes

338
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,130
stuff much simpler

339
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,900
and then also the starter issue or

340
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,260
junior job label which is just for for

341
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,750
issues which are very good for people

342
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,200
new to the project so and you as you can

343
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,840
filter with two tags so you can combine

344
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,970
these tags and you can just see oh what

345
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,500
can I do as a designer new to the

346
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,800
project so it's simple stuff like some

347
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,490
logo I can has misaligned or very there

348
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,820
needs to be some CSS fixes or something

349
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,000
is broken in Safari or whatever and yeah

350
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,610
some of the time of course we need to

351
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,010
fix these things but oftentimes we also

352
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,530
just leave them open for a bit longer

353
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,000
intentionally to get more people

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,040
involved and this is also perfect for

355
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,110
for events for like small hackathons for

356
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,010
example where for for new people to get

357
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,330
involved that we have like a list of

358
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,960
issues that need to be done so that's

359
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,380
that's very raise their hand again if

360
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,060
you don't have a design tag if you don't

361
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,470
have a starter issue tag please create

362
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,260
them now and add issues to it like and

363
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,420
open issues if you don't have them yet

364
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,640
like if you know of design issues in

365
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,970
your project just just open them and

366
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,990
yeah communicate them openly so yeah I'm

367
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,610
very happy that our design team is

368
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,410
actually think the biggest team in the

369
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,540
entire organization and I would say like

370
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,850
it's a pretty big team for any open

371
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,860
source project and I mean of course some

372
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,270
people are more active some people are

373
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,060
less active but in general it it gives

374
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,590
like a great feeling that you can always

375
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,810
just mention like github has this

376
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,420
@mention functionality that you can just

377
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,550
add next to our designers review please

378
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,940
or what do you think of this and as

379
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,530
there are so many aspects like Android

380
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,660
app calendar app desktop and stuff like

381
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,510
that it's very cool that that yeah

382
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,230
people get designers involved and then

383
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,000
also some of these designers are in

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,760
individual teams of the apps for example

385
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,360
so yeah thanks to all these folks on

386
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,060
contributing so first thing last thing

387
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,180
is talk about design like make it make

388
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,800
it an actual topic this is similar to

389
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,850
the culture of design actually say it

390
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,430
I know in tweets or in communication

391
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,710
don't just say hey we do a developer

392
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,900
meetup just say either we do a

393
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,480
contributor Meetup or we do a developer

394
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,370
designer meetup or we do a contributor

395
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,020
needs of developers and designers are

396
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,850
very welcome just basic stuff like that

397
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,350
for example also publish updates which

398
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,070
are specifically about design this is

399
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,970
unfortunately blogging as always

400
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,770
something which is neglected I have the

401
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,920
feeling and we are guilty of that too

402
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,130
but yeah sometimes we have like design

403
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,680
team updates and it's like when we had a

404
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,089
discussion at the comfort conference

405
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,970
with a bunch of info how to get involved

406
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,760
some feedback what was good and then

407
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,699
also we had three good questions that we

408
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,680
that we discussed for example how was it

409
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,599
design decided on how to approach a new

410
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,970
feature and where's design help needed

411
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,069
or how do I ask for it as an app

412
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,790
developer so yeah if it's if this custom

413
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,230
this way at a developer meeting

414
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,360
contributor meeting then it's good yeah

415
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,270
to notice like how you were you lack

416
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,660
things and how to improve things and

417
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,570
coming back to the first point also yeah

418
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,610
by the way next our conference will be

419
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,920
in Berlin in August and one thing that

420
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,110
we say specifically there in the text

421
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,720
focus will be on coding design front end

422
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,850
work and testing so we actually

423
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,740
mentioned it it's just a small thing

424
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,230
right we could just not mention that

425
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,600
sentence or we could just say every

426
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,030
developer interested just come around

427
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,700
but we specifically mention design front

428
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,430
end work so people of that area

429
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,010
designers will feel welcome and and

430
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,400
that's often all it takes for for for

431
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,600
designers to contribute so to recap have

432
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,790
a culture of design establish a culture

433
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,730
of design of simple design preferably to

434
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,370
make it to make it user centered be

435
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,230
informative explain what your project

436
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,060
does in easy terms on your website or

437
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,480
and you read me be very welcoming to new

438
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,550
people in general like this also this

439
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,350
doesn't only apply to two projects

440
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,140
we need designers replies to any project

441
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,260
and then also talk about design make it

442
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,840
make it a topic and and raise the

443
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,620
