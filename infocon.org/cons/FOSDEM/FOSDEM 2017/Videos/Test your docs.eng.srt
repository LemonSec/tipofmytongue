1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,600
okay welcome to my slightly amended talk

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,420
I had my own continuous integration

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,400
system over here checking my spelling

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,890
when I changed the title there's a bit

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,230
slow but thanks very much I've changed

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,150
the title slightly mostly because they

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,879
kind of had the idea I've experimented

8
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,940
with this idea a little bit since their

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,890
call for proposals so I've changed it a

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,210
little bit but it is still about

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,399
automating things maybe a little less

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,050
about testing but most definitely about

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:54,190
automating or making things simpler one

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,940
of those strange people yeah go for it I

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,239
used to be a programmer but then I kind

16
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,229
of realized those better at explaining

17
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,019
things then actually doing it so now I'm

18
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,060
basically a full-time technical writer

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,490
technical blogger a bunch of different

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,649
things this presentation is based on

21
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:13,570
some experiments and also some blog

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,240
posts I wrote for a code ship who are a

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
CIA tool originally Austrian placed in

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
Boston so called an Austrian a series of

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,689
blog posts that I wrote about kind of

26
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,130
automating some documentation that's

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,840
just finished so you can read a bit more

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,680
on those if you want on their blog now

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,710
let's get started so what is one of the

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,590
first things you look at with your new

31
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,049
project and I'm going to use project to

32
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,770
imply product module library whatever

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,179
this is call it a project well they're

34
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,549
all documentation ok different places

35
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:55,600
but they're all documentation so I think

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,049
most developers and most product people

37
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,280
especially acknowledge that

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,789
documentation is important and yet it

39
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,789
often gets overlooked I've got a couple

40
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,008
little quotes here so this is kind of a

41
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,860
nice ideal of where you're getting to

42
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,470
with documentation this is from Ken

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,350
Williams the founder original creator of

44
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,319
Perl so doctor

45
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,390
is complete when someone can use your

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,709
project without having to look at its

47
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,079
code and this is common often when you

48
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,760
don't understand the documentation you

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,019
dive straight into the code and try and

50
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,180
figure it out

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,730
but why is this this is another quote

52
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,799
from someone possibly slightly less

53
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,750
well-known but a guy I met from

54
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,840
Wikimedia when I was doing a similar

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,519
talk to this he said documentation is

56
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,530
like housework we all know we should do

57
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,189
it but we don't really want to so what

58
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,950
this talk is kind of about it's not

59
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,659
about better documentation per se I

60
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,120
actually have another talk on that and

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,459
it's related to a blog post that you can

62
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,489
find on my website or a medium which is

63
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,079
actually been very popular which is good

64
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,120
because that was the point which is kind

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,709
of a crash course in documentation for

66
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,659
developers just simple things to make

67
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,180
documentation better without having to

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,060
think too hard so this talk is kind of

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,449
another side of that it's actually about

70
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,549
what can we automate what can we make

71
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,379
simpler what can we have a bit of fun

72
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,229
with instead of just writing you might

73
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:27,079
have seen my chinchilla earlier just as

74
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,699
a guy with a fox hat walks in which is

75
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,109
very cool this is a I looked up four

76
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,519
pictures of chinchillas doing

77
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,139
experiments looking up pictures of

78
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,879
animals doing experiments is not a good

79
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,489
idea because you get some very lots of

80
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,939
pleasant pictures so this is about the

81
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,930
best I could find

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,220
it's a chinchilla reading a book so

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,280
basically this talk is more of just a

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,919
list of experiments and ideas it's a

85
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,349
little incohesive it doesn't really have

86
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,989
much of a narrative it's some ideas I've

87
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,909
tried some ideas I haven't completely

88
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,979
tried some ideas other people have try

89
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,229
it and I'm going to use tools and

90
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,969
methods that are not necessarily the

91
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,340
only way to do these things kind of get

92
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,709
some inspiration from them and find a

93
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,479
tool chain that works for you that does

94
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,810
a similar thing basically so spelling

95
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,219
catching all those little mistakes and

96
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,900
one of the things about spelling is yes

97
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,900
spelling doesn't necessarily affect the

98
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,060
quality of the content

99
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,610
it shows a certain level of care

100
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,480
professionalism especially if you're

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,980
working on a commercial tool or

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,620
commercial open source projects well

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,210
that has a large user base it just shows

104
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,700
that little bit of extra care that you

105
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,260
go for spell checking is not new

106
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,450
actually I mean there's spell checkers

107
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,400
have been around for quite a long time

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,260
but what are some of the tools we can

109
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,780
use to automate some of that well one

110
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,600
that I have been mostly using sort of

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,919
come to this one of the kind of grand

112
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,320
parents of spell checking is hum spell

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,410
it's used in LibreOffice OpenOffice

114
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,660
lots of Mozilla products it's even used

115
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,050
in Chrome it's also used in Mac OS it's

116
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,870
used in Oh what else I got a long list

117
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,139
here

118
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:19,700
InDesign apparently I don't know if that

119
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,290
includes other Adobe products or just

120
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,729
InDesign opera and a whole bunch of

121
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,680
other applications so the cool thing

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,770
with this is you can keep consistent

123
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,970
dictionaries as well

124
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,830
if you especially in technical

125
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,389
documentation we have a lot of buzzwords

126
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,210
a lot of words that are incorrect but

127
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,950
are actually correct so we don't want to

128
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,690
flag those as spelling errors and the

129
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,430
advantage of using something standard

130
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,620
like hum spell is not only can we put it

131
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,380
in build systems or in text editors we

132
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,700
can actually give it to people who use

133
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,310
OpenOffice not office unfortunately but

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,410
OpenOffice and other tools as well so

135
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,390
they also have access to the same list

136
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,330
of custom words so all our documentation

137
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,710
can be consistent so if you want to use

138
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,700
humm spell directly it's in most Linux

139
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,270
package managers it's also in homebrew

140
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,100
Windows you can get it in

141
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,330
cygwin but it's not so easy as is usual

142
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,930
with Windows and then basically this is

143
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,500
a sort of the command I'm actually just

144
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,880
going to run this and then I'm going to

145
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,740
kind of talk through what it is and what

146
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,550
happens I'm going to keep switching

147
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,169
backwards and forwards the demos so I do

148
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,190
apologize but so a speller Huntsville

149
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,650
are kind of loosely based on similar

150
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,020
things the main reason I stick with

151
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,330
Huntsville is just some of the tooling

152
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,270
that uses it

153
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,240
which I'll come to a minute this is more

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,590
of it that's basically it

155
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,810
okay so this is that command the blue

156
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,630
gets a little bit unseen this will

157
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,650
probably take do quite a lot so these

158
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,030
have been running it locally of course

159
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,230
if you were going to do something like

160
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,200
this in on a CI you would really want to

161
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,010
tidy this up a bit

162
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm whoops yeah I'm doing all the node

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,460
modules as well that's probably not a

164
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,000
good idea let's go to something more

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,770
more a little more a little smaller

166
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,150
selection there we go okay so there's a

167
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,770
lot of noise here and I've intentionally

168
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,210
done this example to kind of demonstrate

169
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,070
some problems we have here first and

170
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,170
foremost but let's look at this command

171
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,810
first so this is just checking recursive

172
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,750
markdown files setting the default

173
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,820
system direct dictionary which in this

174
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,570
case is us English and I've forgotten

175
00:07:51,570 --> 00:08:00,560
what the H is yeah I'm sorry yeah I

176
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,650
forgot what the H command is maybe it'll

177
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,390
come up in a second or we can of course

178
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:14,700
always consult the documentation what is

179
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,849
H

180
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,050
HTML yeah okay good but we still got

181
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,680
here a lot of things that we're not

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,190
quite right there's a lot of code being

183
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,729
highlighted as spelling error there's

184
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,929
yeah more frontmatter in the markdown

185
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:42,789
file being sparked as problems and this

186
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,280
is so default by default hunt spell

187
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,740
isn't really designed for checking code

188
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,410
so this is not so useful to us at the

189
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,830
moment obviously there are ways to get

190
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,450
around this and this is why I

191
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,950
intentionally showed this first because

192
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,030
the next one I'm going to show you is

193
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,160
one that kind of respects markdown at

194
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,880
least but depending on what your spell

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,290
checking this could still be a valid

196
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,420
option but what I've been using

197
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,820
especially for markdown and there are

198
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,890
equivalents for this for other markup

199
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,630
languages esky doc rst etc etc is an NPM

200
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,190
module called markdown spell check and

201
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,560
you can see some of the commands are

202
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,380
slightly similar and it will respect the

203
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,540
markdown formatting so let's try that

204
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,689
one

205
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,459
and that doesn't really was not

206
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,939
reforming

207
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,459
ah that's all right okay the module is

208
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,689
called markdown spellcheck but the

209
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,209
command is empty spell which is slightly

210
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,610
confusing but in this case we get

211
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,910
firstly a much nicer output and secondly

212
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,800
it's respecting code blocks but we can

213
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,079
still see there are some words in there

214
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,899
that are correct but not correct in kind

215
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,779
of default English so how do we handle

216
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:25,959
things like that so this module this NPM

217
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,480
module in particular uses a dot spelling

218
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,879
file I won't zoom in on it just it's

219
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,420
just a list of words that's it basically

220
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,430
it's a dot spelling file for this module

221
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,699
that you can put all the custom words

222
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:50,230
that should be accepted by there is a

223
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,910
reason for that I'll show you something

224
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,250
I haven't done which is it's in the

225
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,209
wrong place it should be the annoying

226
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,139
thing with this module is it always

227
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,050
wants to file on the top level so in my

228
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,480
Travis files in this case we have it

229
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,600
clones it and then moves it up

230
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,420
so in this case we get less errors yeah

231
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,509
didn't move

232
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,970
oh I mean the wrong folder that's it

233
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,119
yeah yeah I'm in the wrong folder but

234
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,589
yeah you just need to move it to the top

235
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,889
level of the of the the folder basically

236
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,739
and so I must admit the the markdown

237
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,989
support for this is the better one but

238
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:49,410
there are other options for it and this

239
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,569
that dot spelling file though is not

240
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,269
actually a recognized dictionary if you

241
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,100
wanted to use this in OpenOffice or

242
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,839
something like that which is an annoying

243
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,319
it's a shame that the module uses a

244
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,999
slightly different format to normal

245
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,980
Huntsville but I found this blog post

246
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,559
with this very memorable URL and it's

247
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,119
quite an old blog post but it does work

248
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,339
that shows you how to convert the dot

249
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,089
spelling file to the AFC and dot dick

250
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,059
files that OpenOffice and eccentric

251
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,549
cetera expects so you can put that into

252
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,259
your build system - it's just bash

253
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,419
commands and you can have kind of

254
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,100
everything available for people to use

255
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,660
as you add new words the other advantage

256
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,559
is hunt spell is pretty well integrated

257
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,290
with lots of code editors so I use at

258
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,720
them a lot personally there's a module

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,169
for it a lot of the other text editors

260
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:45,509
have it by default again and it's

261
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,549
available as a module for most others so

262
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,230
again you get that nice consistent

263
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,389
experience of the same custom words the

264
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:57,889
same flow everywhere you use it okay

265
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,499
spelling actually I will no I think you

266
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,179
could get an idea of how the command

267
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,470
looks I won't bother showing you Travis

268
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,539
help but I think you get the idea there

269
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,970
so the negative with some of these and

270
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,129
it's not so much with this one but it is

271
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,959
with the other one is deciding whether

272
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,389
spelling errors should break a build or

273
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,119
not especially because you have a lot of

274
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:22,019
customers and so firstly just deciding

275
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,669
whether it should lead to a successful

276
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,149
build or not and secondly if you don't

277
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,009
want it to break a build you need to

278
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,799
make sure it returns an exit 0 otherwise

279
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,880
it will break the build

280
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,069
so I have a lot of overrides I use the

281
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,240
kind of spelling checks as a guide for

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,370
now whilst I'm tuning them and I just

283
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,620
forced them to succeed and then I just

284
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,639
go and read them later

285
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,639
otherwise it depends how important its

286
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
to but that's this is one note so

287
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,319
writing better this isn't just grammar

288
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:56,730
this is kind of advice on writing better

289
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,220
too and actually there's a lot of

290
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,660
commercial tools for this as well

291
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,160
grammerly is probably one of the most

292
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,160
popular ones and unfortunately they

293
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,040
don't have any kind of API or any sort

294
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,660
of CI tool it's just a desktop

295
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,100
application or a website that you just

296
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,589
place your text into but also the kind

297
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:14,910
of open source equivalents are things

298
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,630
like Alex and some other modules that do

299
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,639
similar things but unfortunately I have

300
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,389
found that grammerly often highlights

301
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,649
has better suggestions which is

302
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,800
unfortunate but a lot of these modules

303
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,910
again are repositories so we could make

304
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,220
suggestions I mean it starts to get who

305
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,470
knows best when you come to something

306
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,079
like language is a bit the woolly area

307
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,949
but anyway so again I like to use this

308
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,790
particular module called write good

309
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,189
which is great great namely it combines

310
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,819
a couple of the different tools so for

311
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:57,600
example trying to reduce extraneous

312
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,230
words you don't need removing

313
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,959
potentially insensitive words some of

314
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,449
the tests can be quite interesting it

315
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,610
seems to highlight every country as a

316
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,600
potentially offensive word which I find

317
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,130
interesting

318
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,100
[Laughter]

319
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,290
sorry every country is highlighted as

320
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,029
potentially profane which I don't quite

321
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,130
get maybe maybe like Switzerland laws

322
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,579
[Laughter]

323
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,350
but you can see here so again it's named

324
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,750
here module works in a similar way and

325
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,290
you can by default or run all tests or

326
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,389
you can run particular tests or you can

327
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,209
run all tests ignoring particular tests

328
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,090
basically

329
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,130
so again I will show a quick example of

330
00:15:50,130 --> 00:16:00,150
this just run it on everything and again

331
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:06,750
this is much more sort of personal and I

332
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,370
would probably recommend you don't break

333
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,690
builds on this because it's a lot of

334
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,070
it's for guidance especially in

335
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,740
technical language sometimes there's

336
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,880
certain things that are not very good

337
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,130
English or good language of that you

338
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,500
write in but there's still the best way

339
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,550
of saying something because its

340
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,260
technical language so it's much more for

341
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,500
guidance and it's not as quite as

342
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,140
helpful output as I love this tool but

343
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,940
the output especially on come online is

344
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:50,130
not great unfortunately there's actually

345
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,400
something I've not looked at but so

346
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,930
these basically are all linters and

347
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,280
actually if I show you how they look in

348
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,740
in Adam for example they feed into the

349
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,010
linter in Adam and they it's actually

350
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,410
much nicer to look at then the kind of

351
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,400
the command-line output but that I'm not

352
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,040
hung percent sure about I'm gonna show

353
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,959
briefly another tool later that may be

354
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,579
more useful for that but they're all

355
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,800
basically linters but instead of code

356
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,500
we're limiting language which is much

357
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,180
grayer of course but yeah so that's the

358
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,980
kind of output you get so this is with

359
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,290
all tests so for example this is passive

360
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,140
voice this is unnecessary wording

361
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,960
there's a whole bunch of examples there

362
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,820
yeah and it's up to you whether you

363
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,700
consider it useful or not I would

364
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,960
definitely use this much more for

365
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,850
guidance another one and I'm going to

366
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,040
show you this because I've when I did

367
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,360
this talk before someone mentioned it

368
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,240
and is a an application cool language

369
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,409
tool which is a Java

370
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,440
program it also works in as a Chrome

371
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,760
extension and part of OpenOffice I'll

372
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,340
show it and you'll probably quite again

373
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,760
immediately see the problem with it but

374
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
[Music]

375
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,749
it's a little slow is one thing it gives

376
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:33,529
some nice guidance but again the problem

377
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,359
with it is for plain text it doesn't

378
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,450
recognize code so that's a may a fairly

379
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,889
big issue for technical documentation

380
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,169
but for other documentation it may be

381
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,909
okay but it gives some kind of better

382
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,719
guidance instead of just sort of dumping

383
00:18:50,719 --> 00:19:00,200
a bunch of problems at you so okay next

384
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,369
steps with this again

385
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,080
continuous integration is certainly

386
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,839
possible annoyingly the right good

387
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,210
module as an exit code gives you the

388
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,210
number of errors which is really

389
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,559
unhelpful and I've had nightmares trying

390
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,139
to get this to work well in CI and

391
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,639
actually at the moment in my experience

392
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,139
with it I've disabled it again because

393
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:23,749
I've had difficulties getting it to play

394
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:30,200
nicely but you know your own mileage may

395
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,359
vary and again as we just saw when I

396
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,529
show you quickly an active and other

397
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,839
text editors it's available as a linker

398
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,759
kind of input and it's pretty much more

399
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,789
useful actually in your live writing as

400
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,929
opposed to on build tools okay

401
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,429
next screenshots this is a cool one so

402
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,049
if you have an application that has a

403
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,999
graphical interface screenshots are

404
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:57,619
extremely helpful in in helping people

405
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:01,249
understand particular interface elements

406
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:05,089
and what something means but they are

407
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,089
extremely time consuming to make and

408
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,489
keep up to date if you change CSS style

409
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:13,309
in your application then theory all the

410
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,349
screenshots need to be recreated so

411
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,809
doing that manually is time consuming

412
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,239
and very easily becomes out of date so

413
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,519
can we automate it of course we can

414
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,960
otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it

415
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,299
and and this is so I've borrowed this

416
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,700
very heavily from the plone community

417
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,919
the plum community and the Python

418
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,379
community in general actually has a

419
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,899
really cool work on automating

420
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,130
documentation

421
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,870
and a lot of the tools are often plaited

422
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,630
tools as well so they like years ahead

423
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,480
of everybody else which is unfortunately

424
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,060
if you don't do Python because you kind

425
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,680
of envious have some of the stuff that

426
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,020
they have but a lot of these examples

427
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,550
I've pulled a little bit out of the

428
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,700
plone documentation and you can go into

429
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,220
their github repository and find how

430
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,900
they've done it themselves because it's

431
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,430
really really cool so the stuff they've

432
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,010
done but in this particular case I'm

433
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,320
using kind of tooling from that you're

434
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,390
probably using for other reasons and

435
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,420
just sort of combining it so firstly

436
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,540
this is basically using selenium the the

437
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,260
webdriver that lets you kind of mock up

438
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,420
webpages so yes in this case this is

439
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,790
mostly for web applications but there

440
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,160
will be equivalents for other types of

441
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,620
application and then I'm using the robot

442
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,490
framework to define tests but in my

443
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,100
particular case I'm not testing but of

444
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,080
course the great thing here is you can

445
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,660
combine this with your tests with your

446
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,270
QA people or yourself and kind of

447
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,660
combine the tooling the so at the moment

448
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,340
the examples are going to show you kind

449
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,310
of the screenshots are getting generated

450
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,840
but they don't automatically end up in

451
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,820
the documentation you just maintain a

452
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,320
kind of file naming standard that when

453
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,730
the screenshot gets updated the

454
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,770
documentation is updated in the plone

455
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,390
documentation they actually have this

456
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,400
running inside the documentation which

457
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,960
is the really cool thing but it only

458
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,690
works in Python so so that's not too

459
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,910
useful if anything else but so first

460
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,510
thing you need a web browser on CI this

461
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,830
is probably going to be Phantom jeaious

462
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,570
but if you're doing it on your machine

463
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,970
you can use Firefox and other browsers

464
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,760
too and then these are the frameworks

465
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,640
we're using so the robot framework has

466
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,680
actually has a screenshotting tool built

467
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,900
into it but it just does full

468
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,430
screenshots full screenshots all the

469
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,970
time which is fine but we can be more

470
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,420
precise so I'm going to run this I'm

471
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,490
going to show you a simple example this

472
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,420
is actually what I did for the coach at

473
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,049
blog post

474
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,059
and some of the more observant of you

475
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,940
are going to see my password here for my

476
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,570
account

477
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:05,570
I'm going to trust you very good point

478
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:17,690
I can just here we go actually then I

479
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,009
cut around the test I'm gonna trust you

480
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,360
I'm gonna trust you I don't have any

481
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,100
particularly admin rights or anything

482
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,600
examine what you've got to do is create

483
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,519
some projects so it's not that

484
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,489
interesting really so this is a bit

485
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:40,909
fuzzy a good point ok I'll change it a

486
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:47,809
bit it maybe I just won't go back into

487
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,330
the other phone ok but this is a series

488
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,499
of tests I'll run it first so I do have

489
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,039
it open here

490
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,570
it runs the test I've defined it's a

491
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,490
little slow because we're actually

492
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,010
firing up phantom we also have to

493
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,620
bootstrap jQuery which is annoying but

494
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,490
it's a little slow and this is also

495
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,010
going to a live website to do the test

496
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,799
so we're relying on Internet as well but

497
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,440
it was just a nice example for the

498
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,049
article thankfully I got a pass and if

499
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,500
we have a look inside that folder your

500
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,240
oops nope sorry for that you'll see they

501
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,630
have an image there I'll actually show

502
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,580
you because I have

503
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
it also does something quite cool and

504
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,570
adds annotations to it which can be

505
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,340
customized you can get rid of this sort

506
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,809
of default style but that's quite cool

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,350
so so notes so click here login field

508
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,929
you know actually like instructional

509
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,539
information yeah so basically what it

510
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,470
does here is you have two files one sets

511
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,429
up if you go back to my password

512
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,990
actually maybe I can remove it now let's

513
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,450
just gonna be hovering on this group of

514
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,850
a very long time I know but that was

515
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:48,350
very very brief so it sets up the

516
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,100
variables

517
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,590
it sets up some keywords we're going to

518
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,210
use place a cleat and then this is the

519
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,770
actual test and the magic that we're

520
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,240
interested in in particular is this so

521
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,250
highlight the form and you have various

522
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,409
ways of selecting the element with CSS

523
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:11,720
or other things add a note again with

524
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,059
the text the position the style and in

525
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,740
capture and crop the screenshot with a

526
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,940
file name again setting the D of the

527
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:31,130
class whatever I'm too trusting and yeah

528
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,460
and so at least here you can see that we

529
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,600
can keep a consistent file name and then

530
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,830
you can build that into the

531
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,110
documentation but if you look at the if

532
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,070
you're lucky enough to be working with

533
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,029
Python you look in the plan

534
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:45,409
documentation you can see how they've

535
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,299
actually built this straight in to the

536
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,320
documentation sorry

537
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,520
no I don't know it's not my gmail but

538
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,290
that's okay and I have to fax with

539
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:06,320
education on that okay so the next steps

540
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,450
they're not a lot but hooking it up to

541
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,490
see I of course making sure you have

542
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,960
those consistent folders and files and

543
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,080
things like that and that especially

544
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,700
have a graphical application is a really

545
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:23,420
really cool feature to add in so testing

546
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,030
so probably one of the biggest

547
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,110
frustrations you've often had in

548
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,310
documentation is you go to a page you

549
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,910
read a code sample and doesn't work

550
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,730
happens all the time so maybe we should

551
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,400
test the code examples to check that

552
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,040
they do work this kind of falls into two

553
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,710
camps I'm gonna start with the easy one

554
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,900
which is maybe tenuously part of

555
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,600
documentation and then the harder one so

556
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,610
the first one is actually testing api's

557
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,060
API documentation so again there are

558
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,160
lots of options for this there's various

559
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,450
ways of describing an API form file

560
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,700
formats so in particular at the moment

561
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,170
in this example using something called

562
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,910
API blueprint which is kind of this

563
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,670
weird markdown hybrid that you can also

564
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,610
define API endpoints expected parameters

565
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,280
expected output and then it's testable

566
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,290
but it's also just marked now so

567
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,970
especially if you're a writer it's quite

568
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,950
a nice format to work with but this

569
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,610
swagger

570
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,080
there's Rama there's a whole bunch of

571
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,820
other options and it's also of course

572
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,850
the option of documenting your API code

573
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,650
and working that way around there's a

574
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,120
lot of options a lot of commercial

575
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,220
options a lot of open source options but

576
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,720
just for the principle I'm gonna stick

577
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,330
with this tool trader which is what we

578
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,860
currently use so in this case we picked

579
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,060
the file we want to do tests we define

580
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,810
the API endpoint we have some hook files

581
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,720
that let us do some processing at

582
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,850
various points in the build so for

583
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,880
example at the moment there's a parse

584
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,409
error in one of the

585
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:08,809
linters of the api blueprint

586
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,489
specification and it breaks all the

587
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,659
builds and they've acknowledged it's a

588
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,340
problem so this particular moment I have

589
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,529
a hook saying skip that test because I

590
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,059
know it's always going to break so until

591
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,769
I'm told that's being fixed I'm skipping

592
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,690
a test and there's other things you can

593
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,749
do there at various kind of stages in

594
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:28,729
the life cycle so again let's have a

595
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,359
look at an example

596
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:39,349
let's close this horrible so in here we

597
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:43,970
have I'm going to find the yeah this is

598
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,139
actually the expected the final output

599
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:49,759
there's a lot of documentation here but

600
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,099
the bits were interested in are here so

601
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,899
defining the end point and some

602
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:58,669
parameters the parameters that we're

603
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,679
going to send to it and the expected

604
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,979
output

605
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
I've changed the structure a little bit

606
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,350
since I prepared this so I just need to

607
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,880
double check it's still exactly where I

608
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,750
expect it to be I'll tell you one second

609
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,730
let's just run that because this'll take

610
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,070
a bit of time to run so whilst it's

611
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:37,130
running hopefully oh dear it could be

612
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:44,060
the Wi-Fi anyway you get the idea it

613
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,040
could be the Wi-Fi or it could be a very

614
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,390
big problem at the company I work for

615
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,450
who knows we're not sure anyway you get

616
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,330
the idea you see expected and then you

617
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,180
get a summary at the end so a Priya is

618
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,070
just a commercial poster and provider of

619
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,970
some of the tooling really you can in

620
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,240
fact trade is written by a pre but about

621
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,070
90 percent of the tooling they offer as

622
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,110
the commercial product is available just

623
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,030
as as projects you can download as well

624
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,600
so so it basically comes down to with

625
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,190
who you want to host the documentation

626
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,110
they have like an interactive console

627
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,170
thing and the error reports go into

628
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,440
their interface instead of Travis or

629
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,000
some like that it's kind of up to you

630
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,670
really but you get the idea there they

631
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,270
usually mostly pass but anyway we'll see

632
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,790
you see what the what's supposed to

633
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,810
happen and of course this kind of thing

634
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,830
is fundamentally designed for CI systems

635
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,300
so it's useful for running locally but

636
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,050
this is usually integrated into actually

637
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,370
writing your API is as well as just

638
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,190
documenting them there's other options

639
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,280
this one was mentioned to me before if

640
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,750
you're a JavaScript program you can

641
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,310
actually write the tests as kind of

642
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,750
JavaScript objects which might appeal to

643
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,770
you more there's postman which is a

644
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,120
desktop application that you may have

645
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,210
used for testing API endpoints and they

646
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,730
have a new man which is kind of you can

647
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,790
create collections of the your test run

648
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,220
the desktop application and then run

649
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,100
them in a CI tool and then there's so

650
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,600
many others so that's reasonably

651
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,250
straightforward what about test

652
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,370
code now this okay I got to show you the

653
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,260
example first and then look at the

654
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:44,059
negatives so I have some Python here an

655
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,289
irst file and this is using Sphinx which

656
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:52,429
is a documentation system for Python

657
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,690
code I think you're already seeing what

658
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,059
the problem is here which is really

659
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,350
really cool when it comes to code

660
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,600
examples so a lot of people say this

661
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,130
like wouldn't it be great to test code

662
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,419
examples but there's a couple of

663
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:04,669
problems firstly when you show code

664
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:06,260
examples and usually to show a snippet

665
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,690
like make a loop whatever but that loop

666
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,880
would not run in isolation you need

667
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,049
variable setup you need libraries

668
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:13,490
imported things like that

669
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,480
so either you in every example so Twilio

670
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,039
does this in their documentation they

671
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,690
include everything you're ever going to

672
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,380
need even if it's just a simple output

673
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,390
or the cool thing that this does is it

674
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,970
actually has these three two blocks here

675
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,909
sorry the set up so what you need to do

676
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,840
to make the test work but it isn't shown

677
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,880
the actual tests that you're going to

678
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,289
there's the code you're actually going

679
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,600
to show and the expected output which

680
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,139
also isn't shown so when you run this

681
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,480
yeah it tests the code example

682
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,000
it wasn't very complicated but it shows

683
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,610
you what got tested but the end

684
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,500
documentation I only shows you the code

685
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,980
snippet now that is super cool I think

686
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,139
it's a really awesome way of doing it

687
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,050
but there is one big problem it's only

688
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,020
for Python that I did tell you they have

689
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,570
some of the coolest tools and that is

690
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,100
one of the coolest and it's only for

691
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,980
Python and only in rst so if you're not

692
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,600
using those two you're a bit stuck I

693
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,020
haven't yet found any solutions to this

694
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,360
the ones I have been suggested are

695
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,940
things like keeping your code examples

696
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,860
externally and bringing them in to the

697
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,090
documentation so they can be tested

698
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,909
independently or using some kind of

699
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,389
regex

700
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,780
to parse the examples out put those to a

701
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,810
file run them etc etc not ideal but

702
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,610
there's some ideas depends how important

703
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,860
it is to you and I would if anyone has

704
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,960
has a solution that I haven't found I'd

705
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
love to hear it later

706
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,680
because it's something that would be

707
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,430
reading oh sorry just write some Perl

708
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,320
okay now I think I have a couple minutes

709
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,760
so I do have a little bit of time for my

710
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,710
bonus material which is could be very

711
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,030
very quick things like generating

712
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,580
multiple formats for epubs for PDFs all

713
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,340
sorts of things pan doc is my tool of

714
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,910
choice

715
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,859
I love pan doc it basically lets you

716
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,470
input a bunch of different formats

717
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,480
output a bunch of different formats it's

718
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,150
very flexible the documentation

719
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,420
unsurprisingly is good the person who

720
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,460
does most of the code is very helpful

721
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,790
and it's a little hard to look at but so

722
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,770
basically this would go through all the

723
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,230
markdown files and I'll start at the

724
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,320
bottom generates HTML actually that

725
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,270
shouldn't be there that line generates

726
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,460
HTML from the markdown but also

727
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,540
generates a PDF generating PDFs from

728
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,730
markdown requires with pan dot requires

729
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,380
delving into the wonderful world of

730
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,520
logic but but you if you don't want

731
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,990
anything complicated you can just go

732
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,940
with the default templates from that but

733
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,710
logic is kind of fun in itself it's like

734
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,200
CSS for print sort of but

735
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,110
but this is a really cool way of

736
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,780
generating manuals out of HTML

737
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,630
documentation things like that and there

738
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,520
are even services that will make this a

739
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,750
bit easier as well but it's a very very

740
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,030
cool tool and editor snippets so this

741
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,980
then if you can see this little video

742
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,570
but it's things like having language

743
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,550
shortcuts or custom shortcuts so I have

744
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,200
something a tool I use here called

745
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
hercule which lets me create special

746
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,710
markdown links and I have a snippet set

747
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,530
up or I have an introduction that we put

748
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,510
on all our github repositories instead

749
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,430
of me typing in each time I have a

750
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,020
snippet set up that I'd have to type a

751
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,080
couple letters for and then I have the

752
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,670
boilerplate text ready to go and hercule

753
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,890
if you're doing markdown is what's

754
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,230
called transclusion so you can actually

755
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,200
have reusable bits of markdown that you

756
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,020
can then bring in to other places and

757
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,280
link them together and then render them

758
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,470
together so if you want to kind of have

759
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,420
repeated text you don't have to

760
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,970
literally write every time there's kind

761
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,560
of two little ways depending at what

762
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,830
stage in the process you are to make

763
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,060
that a bit quicker and easier

764
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,180
and again most text editors I'm sure

765
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,830
I've forgotten some I tried to include

766
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,050
all the main ones and have snippet

767
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,570
support either built in or as a package

768
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,869
finally said this is a placeholder thing

769
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,010
so this is something I've been using

770
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,109
recently so in the documentation I have

771
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:56,210
lots of placeholders for examples so we

772
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,760
have a product that has you need access

773
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,619
tokens you need space IDs you need a

774
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,600
bunch of different things and if I if we

775
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,980
feel like we want to change the example

776
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,930
at some point I could do a big search

777
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,690
and replace or we just have all the

778
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,240
replacements defined in a batch script

779
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,890
and then we'd have to change them in one

780
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,020
place and when the documentation is

781
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,390
built then it replaces them or I might

782
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,600
come back

783
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,400
what we do is we show example we said

784
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,369
yeah yeah yeah it's another way to do it

785
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,670
I went down this path for some reason it

786
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,390
works for me yeah and that's a really

787
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,670
nice way of just having examples that

788
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,119
you can swap out with in one place again

789
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,770
reducing the amount of extra work you

790
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,349
need to do so if you're interested in

791
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,690
knowing more this is actually again a

792
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,880
memorable link to the sort of writing

793
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,050
better documentation blog posts koala is

794
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,210
a really cool tool I've saw someone with

795
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,460
one of their t-shirts on earlier they're

796
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,849
mostly around Hamburg but he's been

797
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,880
doing the rounds and and it's basically

798
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,020
so a lot of these were what's called

799
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,330
linters and koala is a way it's a tool

800
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,950
that lets you combine multiple linters

801
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,160
into what they call koala bears I'm half

802
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,670
Australian so it makes me laugh but yeah

803
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,010
it's it's not quite there but they have

804
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,830
some really nice ideas and it's Python

805
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,599
of course but you can actually wrap the

806
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,130
Python around other languages which is

807
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,589
also cool check the docs is a little

808
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:31,260
project that myself and again some of

809
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,250
the people use on the plone

810
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,859
documentation kind of working on

811
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,720
alongside write the docs which is sort

812
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,220
of writer's community about testing

813
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,290
Doc's not much there right now but that

814
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,390
will happen and if you're interested in

815
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,859
just chatting about these sorts of

816
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,050
things then the write the dogs community

817
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,260
has flex slack channel I think we still

818
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,680
have IRC as well and why even bother

819
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,030
with all this in the first place my

820
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,119
golden words that documentation isn't

821
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,070
just for developers so let's make it as

822
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,650
