1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
otherwise there's so much noise

2
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,710
so I would like to present you a game

3
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,040
framework for the big box so this

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,839
presentation would be too nerdy maybe

5
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,570
and well it has been fun to do I don't

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,100
know if you'd put different to you or to

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,229
watch but anyways the occasion to

8
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:51,650
present it so first what's the big box

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,500
the big box is a small console that has

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
been made for fun of course well yeah I

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,220
will pass it to you it's tiny console do

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,780
it yourself open source open hardware

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,830
and the idea was to have a side project

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,170
for fun to build a console because I

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,670
liked electronics so what could I do

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,490
while the game console of course and the

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,740
aim is to be doing soos do-it-yourself

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,580
so so that other people could redo it

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,650
themselves so availability of the

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,630
components so you don't have to be due

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,760
to buy hundreds of thousands of the same

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,470
chip to have to actually have this

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,540
change to have one so a very simple way

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,220
to do that you can do that in your

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,030
basement which I did with no particular

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,020
skills or hardware so it's a kind of

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,790
ritual game console project because

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,040
do-it-yourself generally means limited

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,920
power generally and it matches very well

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,350
with the ritual game concept and it's

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,310
fun to build some yet and in a way it's

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,250
really rich recording also because I'll

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,710
show you it's very low level so the

34
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,229
characteristics of you can't see ok it's

35
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,949
single board computer or control there

36
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,319
is one chip on it only that was on one

37
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,430
of the simplicity of the design

38
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,780
decisions

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,930
the airport is on vga there is a 15 bit

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,230
output VGA you got 2 USB 1 micro SD

41
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,680
input so that you can load the games the

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,750
CPU itself is a microcontroller so you

43
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,650
get in it 168 million is 1 mega flash so

44
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,720
one game should make one make maximum

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,630
and 192 kf1 which means that are the

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,620
typical resolution 640 by 480 you don't

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,840
have enough room to store a single

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,500
picture single screen on run so you have

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,330
to generate it and you have to raise the

50
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,959
beam meeting that at the beginning you

51
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,760
have to generate line by line very

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,760
quickly and at the end of of the screen

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,740
you get a top so you move your game and

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,530
your advantage sprites and go back and

55
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,770
generate on the fly so you cannot if you

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,650
want to output movie you cannot remember

57
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,510
what was the preceding frame to compress

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,150
pregnant because you don't you don't

59
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,640
have enough memory but let's make it fun

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,680
it's basically the limitations that make

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,410
it fun because there Raspberry Pi 3 has

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,160
had on how many times the power of this

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,400
this is very tiny and it was too

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
powerful

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,030
I never saw big bets micro which is

66
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,380
basically half the big box in every

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,170
possible element so the sizes roughly

68
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,670
half the number of USB port is half as a

69
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,610
number of micro SD has half meaning

70
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,970
there is no

71
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,760
you speeds memory the resolution

72
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,900
everything is in half so that's

73
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:05,410
basically it so development on this

74
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,300
cutting you down to bare metal you don't

75
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,860
have the room to have to have an

76
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,590
operating system no driver not leaves

77
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,510
you dinner you have your game and you

78
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,858
run your account the console and you

79
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,108
have to code everything by hand which is

80
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:28,490
fun for some kind of people generally

81
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,770
those are modern interfaces in retro

82
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,860
console compared to virtual console you

83
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,770
have USB your extra and the tution is

84
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,740
the standard gccu you download that on

85
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,070
you've been to by example debian after

86
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,010
you get GCC are embedded a bama you you

87
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,020
can develop for it so it's quite simple

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,169
[Music]

89
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,030
with this one you going to windows mac

90
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:02,990
OS and haiku of course thanks so there

91
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,610
is a pc back-end is not really an

92
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,830
emulator it's basically a real

93
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,140
implementation of the basic API a kernel

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,240
api it's basically a kind of flips to

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,610
initialize everything to simplify the

96
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,010
development and there is a real

97
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,560
implementation of this higher level API

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,750
which as deal so basically you make all

99
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,770
of your game high level stuff and you

100
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,320
code it on the PC and that report it on

101
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,900
the bit but there is some people who

102
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,150
develop completely a game which is

103
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,139
developed with the API and with the

104
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,110
emulator mmm let's call it like this and

105
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,090
they send it to me and just with our a

106
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,479
compilation it run on the bit box which

107
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,419
nice form is there is some generation

108
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,880
some generation is basically you write

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,940
bite in memory and it outputs to the

110
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,060
speaker that's the kind of level of

111
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,960
hardware you have so basically know

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,630
and so you have to hurry so but the

113
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,520
existing library is very nice library

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,360
for chiptunes also made by somebody

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,389
Thanks with a tracker to compose your

116
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,569
sons and to help you having chiptunes

117
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,889
enter USB handling is particularly nice

118
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,650
and simple to write yourself in see so

119
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,060
there are libraries because it's really

120
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,569
painful

121
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,560
in fact handling a USB gamepad etc

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,910
because it's difficult to make a gamepad

123
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,130
that is pleasing to do so I didn't want

124
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,759
to do that myself so I'm reusing USB

125
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,440
stone or game pack that you can find for

126
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,190
very cheap and the 5th generation they

127
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,160
are kind of library also available to

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,490
avoid you for doing routine stuff

129
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,389
but you can do it yourself and do basic

130
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,440
the basic I would say think about this

131
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
concept is not invented here the thing

132
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,069
is to redo everything yourself

133
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,319
so it's perfectly understandable to to

134
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,599
drop everything every library is extra

135
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
and recreate on your own that's what

136
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,360
interesting for certain people against a

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,610
community there are a few big boxes

138
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,820
around the world a few dozen small

139
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,830
active core developers for making games

140
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,710
or libraries there are custom extensions

141
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,789
Hardware extensions and really kind of

142
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,650
video output you can output on TV not

143
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,960
using using Scotland theater just so

144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,630
there is some output to to do this that

145
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,280
has been in after the fact that has been

146
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,030
hacked from the console it well itself

147
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,389
there is an external port for the Tajik

148
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,460
port so you can provide whatever you

149
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,900
want and have the external funny

150
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,419
controllers or physical I don't know

151
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,690
button so what you want so and you have

152
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,360
to do to do the driver yourself of

153
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,730
course

154
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,070
Exeter Exeter Exeter add the receptor

155
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,810
index with so far

156
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,230
after 26 centuries for different

157
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,990
software so you can see there is a full

158
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,390
motion video game soda coming live from

159
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,360
the SD card directly outputs and

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,960
decompressed arrived there is a Buddha -

161
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,740
oh there is a you can recognize some old

162
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,270
games over there jumper games polarity

163
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,070
reputable which is kind of a mobile

164
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,679
gamer snowy forest it was where is it

165
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,740
yeah some other good support of a super

166
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,289
ness and there are mediators also an

167
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,080
8-bit emulators it's a 32-bit console

168
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
playing 16 being games and emulating a

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,000
bit systems so the systems are there's

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
game very military as Alex pick strong

171
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,310
military and of course or ml5 which is a

172
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,370
tongue song very it is a French computer

173
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,650
nobody knows but I have had it in school

174
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,360
so I I didn't I honestly write the

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,460
military's just reports for existing

176
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,250
emulators and axing to the code to

177
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,250
remove mostly everything that is not so

178
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,570
so that it could fit on the memory and

179
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,600
yeah yeah there is a graphical drum loop

180
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,370
sequencer there is a tracker for which

181
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,340
there is no okay and some

182
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,940
if I can follow the link yep

183
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,810
if it were it should be okay so it's a

184
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,520
it's a trekker to compose your song

185
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,000
directly on the big box itself or some

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,390
work in progress because a bumble man :

187
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,250
which is not finished and many many many

188
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,400
many prototypes of games which I didn't

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,050
finished of course so making games how

190
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,480
do you make games for the big box well

191
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,990
let's make a little survey quickly who

192
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,100
knows game development in sea making

193
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,450
simple games generatrix starts out with

194
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,630
collision so making a smoke to the

195
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,730
making pixel graphics with game - to

196
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,100
deliver design with child by example and

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,290
comparing cross compiling everything for

198
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,670
an hour in cortex and for its in compose

199
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,540
music with a tracker for this it seems a

200
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,190
little complicated it is not every

201
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,050
single task is quite not complicated but

202
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,940
if you don't know sir well then it can

203
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,580
be a little intimidating so the idea was

204
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,220
to lower the perceived barrier to entry

205
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,770
to build program and design some more

206
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,870
simple games for the big box so let's

207
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,240
make a new server who can draw a BMP

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,770
favorite game

209
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,300
so the idea was to simplify the process

210
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,670
and having copied simple game with a

211
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,910
unique image so you put it on the RC

212
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,250
card you put the SD card on the console

213
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,770
and there is an interpreter who loves

214
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,600
your image in RAM and runs from this

215
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,149
then you then play the game it scenario

216
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,500
make up for the big box except you can

217
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,990
redraw it yourself restricted to certain

218
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,820
kind of 2d games but there can be

219
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,209
several kind of gameplays or of course

220
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,010
it's very limited and that's the idea of

221
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,050
course to to limit it shouldn't general

222
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,020
workflow there the reference MD you saw

223
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,110
a kind of documentation you can read it

224
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,740
you store your BMP funds the SD card and

225
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,600
the reference generates some definitions

226
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,570
the program reads them and plays it or

227
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,890
the PC emulator so what do you need to

228
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,910
do a level 2d platformer and what how do

229
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,690
you put that in an image and so

230
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,910
basically to make a 2-d game platformer

231
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,709
such shooter infinite runner

232
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:05,050
you need to have world physics how do

233
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,390
you scroll how do you jump rays or any

234
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,060
gravity or not yet

235
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,100
you need to have typeset graphics so

236
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,190
little picture that will repeat to make

237
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,010
you a level you have to have your little

238
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,930
time apps how do you order different

239
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,740
levels the sprite frames graphic of

240
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,660
course different frames different

241
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,550
behaviors and movements that different

242
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,560
ways to do that you can have a full

243
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,360
programming language but it exists

244
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,370
there's a Mondrian by example it's a

245
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,140
graphical programming language but it

246
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,410
doesn't really fit well on the limited

247
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,970
very limited image so you can also use

248
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,399
presets so you just have one sprite is

249
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,160
always so anyway the idea was to mix a

250
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
little those to be versatile versatile

251
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,149
enough and to fit in one and you need to

252
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,010
have music and sound effects so you'll

253
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,810
you encode it first you start with a

254
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,339
blank canvas the canvas is 256 colors so

255
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:05,589
you can index it by number from zero to

256
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,470
0xff and this number will be repeated

257
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,860
quite a bit of time so hence the name

258
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,060
250 or 256 color

259
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,150
pixel by pixel and bitmap it's divided

260
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,330
in sixteen by sixteen squares or 16 by

261
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,790
16 pixel which means that with your

262
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,160
color types and pixel per tires you say

263
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,010
that there is a mapping between the tile

264
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,960
it's the number of the choice if you

265
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,090
number the tires themselves on your

266
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,300
drawing one pixel in a time you can have

267
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,000
a cap left pixel which represents the

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,060
top left tile on the whole image and a

269
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,610
color so you can give a color and

270
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,050
reference and there is a relationship

271
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,850
with the tide with the color because the

272
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,270
color as an index from zero to zero X of

273
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,900
F so it can be represented by a pixel in

274
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,650
the time maybe so let's use this so this

275
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,750
is by a simple simple well canvas but

276
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,370
you can start from a blank one is just

277
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,860
to show you the how its ordered you see

278
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,990
there is a color represented for each

279
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,510
tile so if you say color EB it

280
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,360
represents this tile and if you say zero

281
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,610
it's the other one you don't have to

282
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,020
start with that you just have to start

283
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,700
with the single palettes which is

284
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,160
ordered like this and you can see that

285
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,060
on your palette the position of the of

286
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,980
the color represent the position on your

287
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,580
picture that's easier to draw now how do

288
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,530
you do the different drawings the types

289
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,570
while you draw you drew it on the canvas

290
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,030
the sprites friend you draw them on the

291
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,940
canvas but you can have several types to

292
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,610
draw them and the tile map or the time

293
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,040
that meaning your levels well you will

294
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,500
draw with the color referencing the

295
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,330
child that you preceding you draw on the

296
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,220
canvas let's make an example the top

297
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,920
left style these number zero zero so you

298
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,800
draw black on your so now we have no

299
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,810
behaviors we didn't say that this is

300
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,339
some sky this is something that blocks

301
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,000
the player etc so for example here we

302
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,010
have some types on the top left so we

303
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,750
have nine ties and plus one and a little

304
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,300
under it the this guy over there is

305
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,190
black meaning that it will reference

306
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,470
this small hopes this male here and you

307
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,640
see here the cheering the datum sorry

308
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,650
it correct spins to the color of this

309
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,860
tile here 16 by 16 etc etc so you can

310
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,940
draw your level like that you can put

311
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,380
some sprites there are some shot over

312
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,320
there so there are prize about 5 element

313
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,560
and you can see the green points meaning

314
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,690
that these points will be the hitbox of

315
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,610
the other sprites

316
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,920
you can have bigger price so the hitbox

317
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,130
will be separated on civil rights or you

318
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,790
will scan after that where it is how do

319
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,310
you represent that on your level that's

320
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,680
easy the first part is that the first

321
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,500
frame of the animation is in number 40

322
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,150
so we put color number 40 on your level

323
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,530
you still cannot play it it's just

324
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,350
display you can have another sprite

325
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,420
bigger one with another hitbox by a

326
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,180
simple this one has only two frames we

327
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,130
didn't see any matter it me make it

328
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,810
there are five types special types of

329
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,380
the bottom which are here to define all

330
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,440
of the behaviour there is a mini-map on

331
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,420
the bottom left maybe you've seen that

332
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,490
in the personing the mini-map shows you

333
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,920
that each picture here will present a

334
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,060
tile on your whole drawing and there is

335
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,730
preset colors for saying well this did

336
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,890
this is a ground this is the sky this

337
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,620
will kill you if you going to rate

338
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,860
etcetera etcetera and this color here is

339
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,960
the color of the first level so you if

340
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,940
you the program is to find it first of

341
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,560
all is here the number of levels objects

342
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,200
info either in one tile where you can

343
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,170
reference how your objects will behave

344
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,510
you can specify three things with three

345
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,020
pixels basically per line per objects

346
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,829
first one there were four with the

347
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,750
position your your object the first is

348
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,540
the physics how does it work how does

349
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,910
the your game is it standing is it

350
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,770
working does it change the player does

351
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,990
it etcetera the number second one is how

352
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,400
what does it do when you collide with

353
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,420
the prior do they give a bonus does it

354
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,750
kill you

355
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,270
does it make you and the level etc and

356
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,750
another one meaning

357
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,900
what is what do I do after be killed do

358
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,659
I spawn another sprites so you're kind

359
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,730
of interaction for example if you jump

360
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,450
on a mushroom by example it spawns

361
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,390
another one that is a coin and it spawns

362
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,340
another one with an animation for giving

363
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,929
you points by example so you can have

364
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,669
some combinations between your different

365
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,919
behavior that those are some different

366
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
behavior I will show you maybe I got

367
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,850
time in the reference you can see that

368
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,700
but you can mix and match different way

369
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,510
to first movement you have static move

370
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,780
once and then disappear bullets so it go

371
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,970
fast through the screen where I walk

372
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,330
walking for if the enemy walking jump

373
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,440
sometimes design pattern cohesion does

374
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,900
it kill the player does it switch

375
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,720
sometimes from one level to two from one

376
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,630
identity to the next one if you jump to

377
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,980
it for example you have you can have

378
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,890
keys to open some doors by example with

379
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,980
that kind of behavior and what does it

380
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,780
do when you when you're killed you can

381
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,980
spawn another sprite so you can see

382
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,700
there the mini-map and a different price

383
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,400
and quickly you can finish it with some

384
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,909
titles here are four titles for four

385
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,409
levels you have some types also for for

386
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,929
another levels you have some pixel

387
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,850
defined here at the beginning to give

388
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,039
you poor level to number what is the

389
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,429
world physics of your game and I didn't

390
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,220
add the music I'll show you you can also

391
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,770
use a real map editor I just put in I

392
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,590
just created some something to use a

393
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,960
real map editor and then output to an

394
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,990
image but maybe let me show you the

395
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,140
images that are that you can do with

396
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,289
that

397
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:31,830
candidates ah can I do it better save

398
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,210
this one in the finished game I will

399
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,249
show you how it works now this one will

400
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:39,299
be you've heard about so you can do that

401
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,229
like that

402
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:43,619
it's basically auto scroll please

403
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,609
infinite jumps and you you die when you

404
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:55,590
touch it or anything this is basically a

405
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,679
four level Mario Bross not everything is

406
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,009
finished not everything is a but you can

407
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,809
compare everything with the different

408
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,200
elements are told you you can see how

409
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,419
our position the different levels what

410
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,889
those different ties and what are the

411
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:14,070
different sprite this one which is

412
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,629
absolutely not finished but it could be

413
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:18,269
done maybe and this one is a space

414
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:21,509
shooter the tiny space shooter this one

415
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:26,879
is a shame of the graphics but it should

416
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:37,369
be okay we'd have to have a small dinner

417
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,489
maybe so does it work okay can you see

418
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:41,879
something

419
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:45,809
okay this one is bad so basically this

420
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,929
is the demo I'll show you maybe let's

421
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:51,470
start with the

422
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
yeah so this one is the one that I've

423
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,950
shown you as a graphics so it's a very

424
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,920
simple title but it's directly read from

425
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,530
the bitmap graphics

426
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,100
I didn't define members on the demo so

427
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,550
they have the guy you can jump you can

428
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,990
so you can see that the gravity is off

429
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,100
because you you you can jump very high

430
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,440
there is some points over there so it's

431
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,140
a sprites that doesn't move except that

432
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,850
has one friend moves a little bit and

433
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,570
then just if you touch it it's killed

434
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,370
there there is no output and you can and

435
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,450
if you got one you have some so let's

436
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,280
just take another one this one is doom

437
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,730
again maybe rating more graphically less

438
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,270
advanced but

439
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,170
and you can add those Oh leaders so and

440
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,450
if you can go through the second level

441
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,510
you can get the second level is a

442
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,610
shooter on this game let's show you it

443
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,480
may be a shooter how you can space force

444
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,720
I don't know if it works actually this

445
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,220
one yes it does

446
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,230
now we cannot shoot in fact because

447
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,780
[Music]

448
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,700
there are actually four this one with

449
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
the first level of Mario there's a

450
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,840
percent of Mario but you cannot see that

451
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,590
and I'm okay but it's playable

452
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,810
it's basically playable so it's better

453
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,130
it's really a work in progress you can

454
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,080
you can try yourself to build on another

455
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,030
one you can draw all you need is

456
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,160
and the emulator which is running and

457
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,420
run on the PC and yeah basically hit and

458
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,150
you can use your same drawing to run it

459
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,260
on the big box directly

460
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:22,970
okay too many ideas but yes you can do

461
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,789
well you could do top-down games with

462
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,010
the gravity because you for you have a

463
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,350
maximum vertical so you could do that

464
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,460
with with it with vertical with no

465
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,880
giance

466
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,320
vertical levels and the gravity it could

467
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,020
be yeah you you could other top-down

468
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,820
growing up would mean that you can have

469
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,950
a negative in Revit II it could be done

470
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,360
of course not the idea is that we will

471
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,860
add some world physics from expanding

472
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,830
what the number of games you can do yep

473
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,429
no because the bid back the question is

474
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:24,460
transpiring or recuperation of the image

475
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,790
in no because a big box is to constrain

476
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,610
for that and so do key reads the

477
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,620
contract of again in memory idioms is

478
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,630
basically a dump of your image in memory

479
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,220
and interpreting and generating the

480
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:46,280
graphics on the fly I don't know well of

481
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,559
course if you are get a compiler sorry

482
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,270
the question was a can you make

483
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,250
multiplayer games well if you got to be

484
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,470
compiler and you have enough time you

485
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,260
could for no it's a little bit

486
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,990
far-fetched for from this but yeah one

487
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,080
other are two USB you should you can
