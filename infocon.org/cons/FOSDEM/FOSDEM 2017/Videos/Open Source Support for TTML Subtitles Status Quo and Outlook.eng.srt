1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,900
okay

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,940
so our next speaker is under ass on

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,889
glasses from the ihe and he's gonna talk

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,740
to us about TTML subtitles and it's open

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,610
to support thanks Christopher

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,130
yeah thanks to you for coming here on a

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,680
Sunday morning and also thanks a lot to

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,660
christophany bu for organizing this

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,290
thought at first and before I dive into

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,259
subtitles some words about my

11
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,770
organization IIT it's called Institute

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,870
for inform technique which translate to

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,300
our something like Institute for

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,190
broadcast technology and our

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,960
shareholders are the public

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,929
broadcaster's of Austria Switzerland and

17
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:49,960
Germany and part of our mission is to

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,750
help the community develop and adapt new

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,780
broadcast technology and it is no

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,769
surprise that we are participating in

21
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,480
technical standardization we are member

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,710
of 70 DB b HP b GV e bu and W SUSE and

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,140
other standard organizations and we are

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,170
actively contributing for ttml and

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,490
subtitles bu and w3c most important

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,260
because the ttml the time text markup

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,700
language is a w3 standard it has quite

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,130
some history it's make sure that

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,310
positive sense it's really stable and a

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,810
lot of people have put their work and

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,090
requirements into this standard and yes

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,980
so major milestone for TTML was 2009

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,480
when it was published as candidate

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,020
recommendation except I'm still as dfxp

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,660
and some of you may know that acronym

36
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,990
and unfortunately they change it when it

37
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,740
reached final recommendation to ttml and

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,320
some still some people do not make the

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,390
link between give expedient HTML but if

40
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,739
you see dfxp this is ttml so to TTML

41
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,780
reached final recommendation status in

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,330
2010 and three years later there was a

43
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,580
a second edition which mainly brought

44
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,150
some clarification and some Corrections

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,650
but nothing of new features the most

46
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,780
important profiles are probably 70 time

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,480
text eobeochigi are and i may see one

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,300
while simply time text may disappear

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,160
more and more over the next year in

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,950
favor of i MC 1 MC 1 is really possibly

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,400
for especially for web delivery the most

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
important profile where we can see a

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,940
conversion of other profiles into i'ma

54
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,390
see one

55
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,130
so ttml is xml I don't know if anybody

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,100
of you have problems with xml seems not

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,630
the case hope so but in 2003 there was a

58
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,680
peak of xml popularity and it was a

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,780
natural choice to use xml but over the

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,350
years web developers lost the love there

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,670
for xml if there was love in the first

62
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,240
place so there was a foundation of so

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,630
what WG where browser manufacturers

64
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,120
split off w3c and developed html5 as

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,000
kind of counterproposal to the XML based

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,510
HTML and it's the same time they also

67
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,080
develop that PTT or 0t d ml was already

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,570
already finally standardized so where

69
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,840
PDT is still favored by the browser

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,970
community and browser manufacturers so

71
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,460
every time you speak up to Gmail you

72
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,650
have to speak from of webvtt and vice

73
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,840
versa also so the two standards are

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,100
there and will stay there although they

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,649
actually solves the same problem

76
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,970
Pepe TT is natively supported by

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,470
browsers and iOS but ttml is often the

78
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,950
choice

79
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,490
of content driven organizations like

80
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,550
broadcasters but also Hollywood studios

81
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,920
so ttml may not be natively supported by

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,750
some browsers or our most borrows us but

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,640
there are a lot of video players and

84
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,669
other frameworks that now support ttml

85
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,280
we see a common trend that standard

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,310
makers use open source who bring their

87
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,870
standards in the market and the same is

88
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,230
true for ttml standard bodies like ebu

89
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,690
have sponsored or developed certain

90
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,200
project like the EBU TTD integration

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,860
index.js Evo DVD is a profile of ttml

92
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,460
and also subset of IMC one it has also

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,630
the ability live get kicked off and our

94
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,620
organization has put a subtitle

95
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,300
conversion framework open-source as well

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,680
as some samples for cheeky ml Netflix

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,970
was also pushing MC 1 or has sponsored

98
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,720
the time text toolkit which is developed

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,180
by Sky enough or impersonal and Adams

100
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,360
who's the editor of ttml and movie labs

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,670
an organization from the Hollywood

102
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,890
studios like Disney Sony and Universal

103
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,320
they sponsored IMC Jas and this is

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,370
developed by PL mu which who is also the

105
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,590
editor of MSC so I speak about most of

106
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,610
the or all of this open-source projects

107
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,010
and I want to go through separate stages

108
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,880
of the chain where you can process ttml

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,860
and I separate into it into a production

110
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,030
contribution distribution and

111
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,010
presentation and if we start with

112
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,080
production so possible most popular

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,830
open-source subtitle editor

114
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,080
edit supports TTML by the way I put the

115
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,940
main programming language and the

116
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,640
license also open source projects as a

117
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,710
bullet point I won't mention them

118
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,740
explicitly and Maya talk but I think

119
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,620
it's clear from the slides himself so

120
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,620
subtitle edit supports cheeky ml it's

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,320
nearly standard confirm I had some

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,550
problems with with styles so coloring or

123
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,550
cannot be done in ttml with subtitle

124
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,110
edit but I think if some few issues are

125
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,270
fixed then it's really standard form and

126
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,420
interestingly their Netflix time text

127
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,640
profile is the most standard confirm one

128
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,980
of TTML for Netflix time Texas may be

129
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,050
worse when she mentioning that this

130
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,110
company's specific profile will be

131
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,630
deprecated by Netflix are in favor aye

132
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,690
MSC so I think for the long run i'ma see

133
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,660
will be the profile if you have to track

134
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,810
not sure if you know Amara Amara as a

135
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,910
community platform for fence Savin fun

136
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,330
subbing and they have an online subtitle

137
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,720
editor and they put also their tool open

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,930
source it has a simple

139
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,310
ttml export the same is satellited CRS

140
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,480
minor back in it

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,890
not really serious but if you test

142
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,740
against under performance it may hail

143
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,120
but I think that could be easily fixed

144
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,960
so this lot is about web delivery but

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,670
ttml actually was also developed to

146
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,340
support archive or an exchange of

147
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,500
subtitle files and one open source

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,080
projects that ya can be used in in this

149
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,020
part of the chain the SCF the subtitle

150
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,230
conversion framework published by iit so

151
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,030
we focus on the quite popular broadcast

152
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,850
subtitle exchange from in the u.s. GL

153
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,240
and we support through accessor T

154
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,939
scripts the conversion from STL to an

155
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,779
archive format of TTML and then to the

156
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,050
distribution format of TTML so it's

157
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,709
actually EBU SD l 2 eb u TT 2 eb u TT d

158
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:15,319
which is also IMS C okay so yeah we

159
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:18,110
mainly use our xml technology there we

160
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,829
use XSLT we would have liked to use XS

161
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,199
32 but because most of the libraries do

162
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,629
not support it

163
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,939
we still restrict ourselves to XS 31 the

164
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,620
time text toolkit is a really

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,389
interesting tool it has different

166
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:41,240
functions and modules you could use it

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,449
can validate different ttml profiles it

168
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,459
can generate

169
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,749
pngs and SVG's from ttml and it already

170
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:54,249
covered some TTML two features like ruby

171
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,470
which you really would like to use if

172
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,329
you want high quality japanese subtitles

173
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,309
so tight x toolkit is very helpful if

174
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,959
you want to integrate your own

175
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,250
implementation as a kind of a compliment

176
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,009
software tool and the same is for the

177
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,170
EBU TT life toolkit which is maintained

178
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:24,410
by EBU and also really greatly supported

179
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,870
and pushed by BBC the EBU T life to

180
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,050
appear it covers a scenario of life of

181
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,050
contribution of streamed subtitles that

182
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,639
could be actually live subtitles but

183
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,980
also subtitle played from file and

184
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,670
streamed it covers the profile

185
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,529
eobeochigi life profile of EBU TT which

186
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,620
is now published as 0.9 and soon and

187
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,089
spraying it will be published as 1.0 and

188
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:03,259
the current carriage mechanism that is

189
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,530
support is WebSockets

190
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,070
and with their beauty life - okay you

191
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,180
actually have scripts to simulate

192
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,530
producer or consumer note or forward or

193
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,030
system that forwards the subtitles or

194
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,030
encode the subtitles to EBU TVB so

195
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,010
that's very interesting and you should

196
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,890
check it out

197
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,890
so for distribution they have been mp4

198
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,930
box support for ttml for quite some

199
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,920
while they enable you to package GT ml

200
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,240
into mp4 this runs out of the box with

201
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,430
EBU TTD but if you use GPX specific and

202
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,270
h ml description language you could

203
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,440
actually use any kind of ttml flavor the

204
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,720
good thing is about mp4 box that's buy

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
from JPEG you possibly know this

206
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,460
projects they are quite active and ntek

207
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,510
standardization so you can really trust

208
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,370
the standard conformance of that

209
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,240
implementation so some the main or the

210
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,650
biggest support for teaching me elders

211
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,660
possibly on the presentation side and I

212
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,020
just pick here three different projects

213
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,840
but are there more how it's there

214
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,610
so first from the standardization

215
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,800
standardization perspective we found out

216
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,750
that it's the first step for

217
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,220
implementation is to have a good for

218
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,670
reference and therefore we published

219
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,390
samples of ttml or the ttml source code

220
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,600
the video and reference images so any

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,690
implementer can use it and this has been

222
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,490
used by a later project I will I will

223
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:03,040
show so VLC player I think doesn't need

224
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,070
any introduction with latest lightly

225
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,030
builds it supports ttml subtitles

226
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,580
possibly also in the official version

227
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,540
I'm not sure

228
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,140
maybe some officer you'll see heads can

229
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,230
I pick me tonight these latest articles

230
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:34,180
from yesterday yes okay fine okay so

231
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,160
yeah I think that's great it supports it

232
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,030
I think it needs some more support of

233
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,920
features like colors and styling

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,690
features but it's it's really good

235
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,820
really good start one thing you have to

236
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,400
keep in mind that you have to rename

237
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,730
your files to txt because for some

238
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,460
reason or the XML extension it's not

239
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,660
supported but maybe we can keep can

240
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,350
figure it out later

241
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,600
one of the most promising of source

242
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,240
project from my perspective currently is

243
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,700
I am CJ S which is a renderer of ttml to

244
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,860
html5 is of course written in JavaScript

245
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,280
and it's I think nearly covers all of em

246
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,420
I see one

247
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,250
and if something is missing that's

248
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,520
because of missing supports in CSS

249
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,090
occurs some of the requirements we have

250
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,480
for subtitles are actually not met by

251
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:41,830
some of the CSS features so just show

252
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,040
you how easy it is to use that once you

253
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,780
have your XML file loaded in it in an

254
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,030
XML string you can use the from XML

255
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,850
message from Ivan see from the MSE

256
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,830
object and then you get back a ttml

257
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,330
object and the XML object has other

258
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,570
functions that gives you all media times

259
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,450
as are so times where subtype president

260
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,920
presentation changes and by going

261
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,860
through this array you can generate a

262
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,160
snapshot a representation of ttml

263
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,670
document for that specific time this is

264
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,070
called in ttml language and

265
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,110
intermediates the quranic document I

266
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,870
just call it snapshot here

267
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,970
and then if you have a redundant node

268
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,240
where you want to insert your subtitle

269
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,500
ttml HTML yeah you just give it to the

270
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,730
render HTML function of IMSC get it the

271
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,100
snapshot ends the Dom node and inserts

272
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,410
it under the gun note and render it

273
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,630
there so I think it's quite easy really

274
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,630
to use it and it has really a good crab

275
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,040
is very standard conformant okay so in

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,020
summary we can see a broad support of

277
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,230
ttml through open source projects and I

278
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,260
think it's just some tweaking needed to

279
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,420
our yeah gets a fool

280
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,040
yeah the full advantage of that and what

281
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,410
we have seen from testing different open

282
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,240
source project they may need some or say

283
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,250
is indeed that standard makers also

284
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,370
support some open source project they're

285
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,950
not affiliated with with test material

286
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,400
and back report and I think then I think

287
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,570
the adoption will even speed up a more

288
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,450
ok so the slides are all on the FOSDEM

289
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,020
sites if you have problems have been an

290
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,180
issue with your file extension of the

291
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,920
PDF slides but if this should be fixed

292
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,180
today so I put just the links up here

293
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,040
just for recording so the most of them

294
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,750
of course are on github

295
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,098
okay and that's it thank you

296
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:18,519
[Applause]

297
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,260
- a while ago and at least fall on minus

298
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,650
t1

299
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:50,390
okay yeah okay the question was if mp4

300
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,250
box is released under confirmed but of

301
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,900
course colleague had problems in

302
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,910
packaging IMC one or the text is the

303
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,220
image profile IM siwan so he said that

304
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,920
he may need a bit careful with this

305
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,100
current status yes as I said if you want

306
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,500
to use another profile like emu TDD you

307
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,790
have to go through this Haan HML

308
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,990
description language so it won't work

309
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,710
out of the box are I checked yesterday

310
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,840
was a colleague row man from from G pack

311
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
and we said okay you can use IMC but you

312
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,380
have to use HTML or I we didn't do it

313
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,030
ourselves we mostly focus on ebu TDD and

314
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,700
there's an ISO standard 1 4 4 9 6-30

315
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,280
that defines how or teaching algebra

316
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,190
package and we see Beauty easy to it

317
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,830
quite right but you're right so that we

318
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,590
looking forward to more support of other

319
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,390
profiles that makes it easier to use it

320
00:18:52,390 --> 00:19:03,040
yeah which is profile ok

321
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,179
sorry what's the profile ok that's a

322
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:14,600
good question it's let's say it's the

323
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,530
derivation of the base TTML ttml it's

324
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,980
very big so it's more like a toolkit so

325
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,100
you won't use all of it but because

326
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,419
everybody from every region in the world

327
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,280
puts their requirements into this

328
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,640
profile in this city ml they won't use

329
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,160
all of it so they subsetted it and put

330
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,410
little extension to it sometimes which

331
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,809
will be later integrated into ttml so in

332
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,600
the main profile as I said our ebu TT

333
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,640
and I MSE is also same TTT still and

334
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,150
still plays role because

335
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,260
also mentioned by US legislation and

336
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,690
there have been also see fftt which is a

337
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,750
comment five former time text but this I

338
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,520
think is also deprecated in favor of

339
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,160
okay the question was if ttml has a

340
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,220
future to adapt to the screen size so

341
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,530
you have the Lang's

342
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:38,690
automatically adapt to it yes and no you

343
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,150
you can think of it as a future search

344
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,940
based on HTML I think process actually

345
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,720
is they're really based on the same yeah

346
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,350
on the same styling styling feature set

347
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,150
and of course you can set wrap as option

348
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,520
for for checks so you do not put any

349
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,150
line breaks then it will just wrap

350
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,130
accordingly and you can use percentage

351
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,350
which you should use for the font size

352
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,640
so the font size adapts dynamically and

353
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,510
responsive to the screen size but the

354
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,690
thing is that subtitles actually put

355
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,570
line breaks in there for a reason so and

356
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,260
they are very fond of the line breaks so

357
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,330
there are some tools or features where

358
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,710
you can expect TTML that automatically

359
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,809
through the screen size but actually if

360
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:38,360
you really want high quality subtitle

361
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,928
you may have to pre-process them before

362
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,470
okay the question was if any of the

363
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,580
delivery options work on iOS yes if you

364
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,770
build an app

365
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,500
which is damaged so the German broadcast

366
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,990
so the German broadcaster have a really

367
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,160
good archive for their video on-demand

368
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,610
content which supports EBU tte or just a

369
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,550
simple profile of ttml works fine are

370
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,210
they have players they work on it it has

371
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,220
some problems if you go fullscreen

372
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,320
but it's because of the native support

373
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,990
of other formats so yeah you can you can

374
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,920
use ttml on iOS but you have to build

375
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,320
your own code around it

376
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,500
[Applause]

377
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,560
you
