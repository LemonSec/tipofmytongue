1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,259
this talk is about a space vidcom I have

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,410
to say I'm a computer scientist and the

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,599
hobby pilot and idea was to present some

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,119
aviation information on the internet on

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,720
a website well that's now what this talk

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,700
is about some information about the

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,290
website a short overview then what what

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,520
I've well which which challenges I faced

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,820
and solved to find to compute distances

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,030
for point of interests around and

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,140
finally the last two points are about

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,510
texture text search auto-completion

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,260
enlarged but sets of data so the first

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,219
one is that when you open a page on this

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,460
website you will see at first you see

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,839
the map map Nick map with an overlay

17
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,790
which shows shows a dot for each app

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,500
Airport in in view and you can select

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,780
certain regions like I did here for

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,740
Belgium where inside this region you see

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,580
the dots and blue outside they are gray

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,920
so all dots here are airports but the

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,100
blue one are the Belgian ones then if

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,250
you zoom in here you see Brussels

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,640
Airport you zoom in then you would also

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
get markers for the four airports and

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,480
these are the the blue rings because

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,360
this is the well it's it's a sign on the

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,700
the official maps and you own here you

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,630
also see something like navigation aids

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,120
this is a radio beacon which can be used

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,790
or which is used for navigation yeah as

33
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,960
I said map data maps can be configured

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,450
you can can choose the base layer or

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,960
overlay layers on your own

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,709
some are pre-configured mattnic already

37
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,190
told about then

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,880
is our I images to get some satellite

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,670
images or the here map then there's also

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,800
FAA produces for publishes sectional

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,590
maps these are a VA shin maps for the US

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,660
and what also interesting our

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,470
topographic maps and Hill shading might

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,470
be interesting or is interesting for

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,000
aviation not necessarily in embed Jamal

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,220
the Netherlands but for instance if you

47
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,850
fly in austria or switzerland then it

48
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,070
can become a real concern the projection

49
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,010
of the markers has already been pre

50
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,900
computed so even while we have several

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,210
ten thousand markers on in the whole

52
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,980
database this this projection is pre

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,060
computed to to get them rendered quickly

54
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,880
then if you click an airport or a

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,850
navigate on the map then the tooltip

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,890
shows and if you if you click on get

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,670
information on the marker you first get

58
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,620
some general aviation airport codes

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,700
location and stuff but you can also

60
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,620
switch through the taps and get weather

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,260
information runway information no terms

62
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,260
means no time means notification for MN

63
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,400
these are official informations like

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,769
closed runways or stuff like that

65
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,510
frequencies navigates around airports

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,190
around if you want to to do a flight of

67
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,410
an hour or so at a certain speed then

68
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,700
you can just choose your airports if you

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,380
don't know where to go you can just

70
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,200
browse through the airport in the

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,470
corresponding distance finally web links

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,160
and Commons

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,330
well mich is terms and conditions like

74
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,290
cookie use of cookies or Terms of Use

75
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,279
and above that you also see this

76
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,850
location field here you can enter the

77
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,220
code or the name of

78
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,660
and I'm currently extending it again it

79
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,570
has already been done before I've but I

80
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,260
have to do it again I'm not working on

81
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,380
it to extend it on populated places or

82
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,200
other significant points yeah and the

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,020
data which is which has been shown now

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,030
on this on this page well where where

85
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,790
does it come from Airport and the

86
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,610
Navigator currently comes from our

87
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,700
airports calm this will be will be

88
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,920
completed and verified but I come to

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,980
that later then magnetic variation which

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,530
is not a concern in Europe because it's

91
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,330
rather low here but for instance in the

92
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,450
USA then you get several degrees when

93
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,000
you when you navigate alright when you

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,040
use a compass for navigation you get a

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,390
deviation of several degrees it is

96
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,820
computed by well get wma this is a

97
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,340
formula or it's a JavaScript program

98
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,370
which is published by NOAA to get the to

99
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,200
compute the the Nevada magnetic or the

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,630
strength and orientation of the magnetic

101
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,990
field on any place on earth sunrise and

102
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,250
sunset data they are also the Twilight

103
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,780
day times routine for that are already

104
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,920
included in PHP weather information and

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,790
no terms are are picked up at websites

106
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,240
and published here again and this

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,390
information are cached just to keep the

108
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,740
load on on this website slow so in the

109
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,350
future we we have to extend it as I

110
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,540
already said to check and complete the

111
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,090
current data so our airports comm has

112
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,360
many airports where where Ranma

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
information is not yet available or some

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,510
information is well not only missing but

115
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,770
some is also wrong

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,090
or outdated and it's not really complete

117
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,190
so for instance in the official

118
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,840
documentation you'll find information

119
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,830
about obstacles like towers wind parks

120
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,700
or whatever or bridges high bridges and

121
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,450
most interesting I found that there are

122
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,310
still navigation lights or lighthouses

123
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,940
which can be used for a plane navigation

124
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,340
from my home country in Germany we don't

125
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,490
have any but in in Belgium there are

126
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,540
some I think some ten of them and one is

127
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,950
even here in Brussels which is

128
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,080
especially interesting because the a

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,270
space over Brussels is prohibited you

130
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,970
may not fly there but there's there's a

131
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,380
lighthouse standing around I have to

132
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,580
check that yeah well a space and we get

133
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,780
a space something like prohibited areas

134
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,510
or control zones also have to have to be

135
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,340
introduced and and shown on this website

136
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,820
and all these data are published by by

137
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,110
the officials in in PDF format and they

138
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,690
have to be converted and then parsed to

139
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,680
to get into this website the finally web

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,290
links currently there are only at most

141
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,160
one or two Wikipedia links for each each

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,040
Airport and plan is to - also - to

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,580
include official airports webs web sites

144
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,450
or flights Goods flying clubs stuff like

145
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,750
that software used for all this is PHP

146
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,600
as I already said databases SQLite for

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,420
for the aviation data MySQL is used by

148
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,190
the common system

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,210
jQuery for the UI leaflet to render the

150
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,919
maps then static map light I found that

151
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,010
and it's it's great to already show a

152
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,300
map while the the tile map is -

153
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,000
rendering

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,740
so you get a first impression you can

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,750
already see if you're at at the right

156
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,839
point well get WMA I already talked

157
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,180
about that and command ticks is a common

158
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,060
system I'm using for on this website

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,699
yeah but now I'm as I said SQLite the

160
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,720
problem here is that when I want to

161
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,139
compute distances for to find the

162
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,069
nearest airport

163
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:20,069
or the Nephites to a certain point okay

164
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,160
I can assume that that earth is a sphere

165
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,120
this gives a very low error there is a

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
this have a sign formula which I've

167
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,269
copied here which gives you from

168
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,089
latitude and longitude the distance on

169
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,300
Earth's surface the point here is SQLite

170
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,870
doesn't provide doesn't provide

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,180
trigonometric functions so you have to

172
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,029
to pre compute the sine and cosine this

173
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,759
at first to make it possible at all but

174
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,029
also to it's it's useful to improve

175
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,079
increase performance because I can't

176
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,939
tell about current processes but sine

177
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,370
and cosine typically are not not

178
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,009
Hardware implemented so you have to some

179
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:14,069
some opportunites have run and causing

180
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:17,509
some some delay or some performance loss

181
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:22,589
but there is there is this this term of

182
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,920
coziness and the difference of the two

183
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,879
cosine of difference of two longitudes

184
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,389
so to put these in into a table you have

185
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:37,620
to put put put it into the table for

186
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,899
each combination you have in in database

187
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,550
so this means you get quadratic

188
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,660
complexity for some 50,000 airports you

189
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,589
get more than two and a half billion

190
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,370
billion items to store and each to at

191
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,120
least well at least two times four bytes

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,970
at least to get reasonable occurs

193
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,670
see this is quite a lot and it's too

194
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,209
much is it reading well there was this

195
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:14,550
and I said yes we can in a modification

196
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,379
of this this election slogan which has

197
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,899
been around a few years ago there is a

198
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,870
drag on the metric and identity so the

199
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,040
cosine of of a difference can also be

200
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,519
evaluated at these four evaluations of

201
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,050
other trigonometric values but these

202
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,740
four can now you know this four can be

203
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,279
stored again in in the table because

204
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,879
there is well there's no more the

205
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,370
quadratic complexity we get back to

206
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,149
linear and so using this this formula we

207
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:58,319
can we really can store all the sines

208
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,029
and cosines in in table and well this

209
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,199
allows to use database like SQLite which

210
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,540
doesn't provide trigonometric functions

211
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:16,639
or it would also mean becoming faster on

212
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,600
if we use well other databases that that

213
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,559
have have the ability to provide or to

214
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,519
calculate trigana metrics functions well

215
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,569
then final point was the name search I'm

216
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,500
taking or I'm using the geographic name

217
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,720
information system of BGA and nga

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,829
it's an American yeah it's originally a

219
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,240
military and dataset and it has several

220
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,449
ten million items in it which is quite a

221
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:58,199
lot and databases are well typically are

222
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,009
slow on on these on these sides of sizes

223
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:05,790
of data so there's some optimization

224
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,290
built in on this website that I use

225
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,920
or a large file is used with all the

226
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,680
entries in it and the quick system does

227
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,610
anybody know the quick system nobody it

228
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,220
has been I've also encountered it when I

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,759
studied in the at the end of the 80s in

230
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,459
the library that each time the title of

231
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,089
each book was listed and alphabetically

232
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,089
according to the to each word in in the

233
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,329
title so this I can't really tell

234
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,630
without without a reasonable example I

235
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,500
couldn't find one so far how this looks

236
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,279
like but it's it's impressive to see and

237
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,319
you can really quickly search through

238
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:55,740
through watch lists by keyword using

239
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,529
this this concept the extension of this

240
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,990
is the suffix array which is this data

241
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,380
structure which is rather new well

242
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,930
rather new but already more than 25

243
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,990
years old but it's still not used very

244
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,949
much and the idea behind it is that we

245
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,440
if we have such a string like bananas

246
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,649
then we take each suffix on it give it

247
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,860
an index so just according to its order

248
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,720
in the industry then we order these sets

249
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,470
of in the index and strings according to

250
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:40,350
the string and in this in this data

251
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,319
structure we can do binary search and by

252
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:47,550
this method finds finds each string

253
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,850
according to its match or just do some

254
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,699
prefix match you already notice I'm

255
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,760
getting a bit faster because time is

256
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,310
running out yeah but using this using

257
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,519
this method you get very fast and many

258
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,889
years ago I already implemented this on

259
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,769
the first and first version of s-phase

260
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,139
v.com more than fifteen years ago and at

261
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,850
that time I talked to some Google

262
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,829
technician who was impressed by the

263
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,740
speed I I reached with this

264
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,800
so we come to the end and can say well

265
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
fSV dot-com provides aviation data data

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
is partially stored partially retrieved

267
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,350
while why why creating the website and

268
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,830
can be used for for simulation or for

269
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,900
choosing routes with choosing choosing

270
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,950
destinations or for evaluating flights

271
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,340
Allah you have done but there is no

272
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,310
endorsement for navigation so you must

273
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,150
not use it to as a sole mean of flight

274
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,720
planning whether also experience here

275
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,780
was this quote of Edison genius as 1%

276
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:12,360
inspiration and 99% perspiration you get

277
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,640
the idea and it's yeah well it's it's

278
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,730
coming it's popping up in mind

279
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,920
immediately and then you're sitting

280
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,430
there days and days and get new

281
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,240
inspirations and finally somehow well

282
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,000
there's no end in sight put it that way

283
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,230
so consequently this website is working

284
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,630
progress there are lots of extensions

285
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,050
and improvements thinkable and they will

286
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,810
come lots of them for instance you might

287
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,060
have seen that there are some social

288
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,140
network links on it

289
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,820
but I will also introduce some

290
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,720
gamification something that been there

291
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,870
done that that you can can click as

292
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,630
Airport where you have been and there

293
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,280
will be some kind of ranking this just

294
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,150
attract attract visitors the layout will

295
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,430
be reworked because it's suboptimal

296
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,270
currently and the ideas I've presented

297
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,010
like the the distance calculation and

298
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,319
the string search can also be used in

299
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,510
others could also be used in other

300
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,670
software like maps taught me which from

301
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,550
I am my feeling seems rather low when

302
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,730
rather slow and then finding finding

303
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,850
strings in its database so that's it so

304
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,770
far

305
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:46,879
any questions yep

306
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,790
question was I don't know if it's really

307
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,010
necessary if I repeat it now because

308
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,730
yeah but the recording doesn't work or

309
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,520
does it yeah well anyway

310
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,250
question was if there are any plans to

311
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,530
also store historical data to see how

312
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,050
our space has changed all stuff like

313
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,070
that no the plan is not there for me but

314
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,500
as I said in the beginning you can add

315
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,290
your your own layers and idea will be

316
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,750
that that well mechanism will be built

317
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,160
to publish such individual layers that

318
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,010
you can give them to to France to other

319
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,320
peoples to other people who are

320
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,080
interested in it

321
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,720
that's also the the idea of flexibility

322
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:58,250
on this website any other questions yeah

323
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,570
question here is if the website is

324
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,040
addressing only private pilot's also

325
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,440
commercial pilots I would say private

326
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,030
pilots at most because and I've it's

327
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,670
it's doesn't have an official

328
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,540
certification for flight preparation so

329
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,180
if you rely on it if we rely only on it

330
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,800
without considering the official

331
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,760
documents then you are making an error

332
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,260
as a pilot and I will expect that

333
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,930
commercial pilots commercial pilots

334
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,540
pilots wouldn't be wouldn't have the

335
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,700
need to consider the data which is on

336
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,380
this which is provided on this

337
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,710
[Music]

338
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,649
okay question here is if there are plans

339
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:42,909
to put in more or more other aviation

340
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,779
data like transponder codes or freezing

341
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,440
altitudes or whether altitude wins stuff

342
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,350
like that dynamic data was also key word

343
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,770
in the question

344
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,850
yeah plants are there but the difficulty

345
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,779
is to find the data on the net in a form

346
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,529
that that it can be used here for

347
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,210
instance the attitude wins have been in

348
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,039
in the first version of the website and

349
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,850
they have been well they have been cut

350
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,320
out of of wind maps which wasn't very

351
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,000
pleasant and not very useful

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,789
so yeah it's question of what cost

353
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,370
under the cost value question here again

354
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:47,740
so if there is no other question then
