1
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,090
Facebook state of a house but it's in

2
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,689
the details and the agency has to be raw

3
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,960
enough because yep cash large cash in

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,509
front of my scale but it just misses the

5
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,810
inquiries are coming to my skill then if

6
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,509
my skill something is grated slow then

7
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,869
it supports people's experiences and

8
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,299
Facebook's which is pretty bad so

9
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,310
Facebook so my syllabus has to be

10
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,409
passing out for the main database and

11
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,849
our relations are both my videos so

12
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,310
habitats so we use brush they say

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,720
Steve's no hardware's and it's but if

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,239
spacebar so that's this is the biggest

15
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,180
motivations of why we started my dogs

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,010
project and it's much space fun so CPU

17
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,150
usage is pretty moderate so it's not CPU

18
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,769
bound accession of slaves so these are

19
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,720
very background so we are in the process

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,609
of migrating by dogs so - migration the

21
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:41,430
photo in this laptop but technical

22
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,260
challenges so instant migrations the

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,120
attention migrations we need to find out

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,370
the optimal my dogs

25
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,810
The Rock's today's current family

26
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,870
options and we need to create my dogs

27
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,389
instance without data because they're

28
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,380
already production services deployed its

29
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,829
innovative so we needed to deploy my

30
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,989
dogs so without stopping existing

31
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,950
services and creating - tables within

32
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,690
short period of time is needed because

33
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,269
our database it's petabytes so if it

34
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,900
takes a long time to just migrate to run

35
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,209
gigabytes and it will take years to

36
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,359
figure it to my rocks which is not

37
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,410
realistic

38
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,190
that's kind of the important points of

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,500
the my talks the cognitive we don't use

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,220
data so all don't be tiring caustics

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,920
wrong wizards there's a crime so how to

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,630
verify that so but if I'm data

43
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,150
consistency between exists existing min

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,510
adhabi

45
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,360
and the new my logs so this verification

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,390
was pretty important laughter deploying

47
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,810
it

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,730
it's a continuously monitored resources

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,360
it is like space or iOS or CPU memory or

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,790
query plans but creativity strands who

51
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,800
was in store for questions so this

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,910
morning was with input another challenge

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,950
is to when Doug might have cell phone

54
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,650
master size so we started migrating my

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,470
dogs on website but master was also

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,240
challenging Soviets we require the using

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,670
robust final log for my logs so it's

58
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,850
same as master Casa where are the

59
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,790
storage engines because statement based

60
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,000
final log needs gap rock portable they

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,310
look like Maya Samoan already so they

62
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,770
don't support get broke theta in my dogs

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,000
so that's why we need our via and so do

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
you mean queries behind on energy a frog

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,250
that's also needed so then not many

66
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,280
queries are exact but for example when

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,260
people want to create the queues on top

68
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,900
of InnoDB then this means you know the

69
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,020
eye on the internet cap rock so this

70
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,350
can't be used in my rules and we

71
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,500
recently supported the excel that 2008

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,560
and support in blocks my logs which is

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
two fades between binary log and our my

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,050
locks

75
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,900
so this it's pretty quick chat for

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
supporting Muslims

77
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,630
so click admire ox instances without

78
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,850
downtime so this was the first step

79
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,360
early comment so this is the trigger in

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,340
my ski just picking up bump signal a

81
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,180
slave then stop slave and damping say

82
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,000
with my skill down then loading into my

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,790
dogs so this is a basic step on say

84
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,970
using compacting to my dogs it's a my

85
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,449
instance so thanks to my series robust

86
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,610
application support the stopping bastard

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,780
does not affect services so my field

88
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,490
application environment is relatively

89
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,030
simple

90
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,220
so it's using a single mast on multiple

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,260
slaves we don't use change marketeer

92
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,729
replication environment because it's a

93
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,700
bit too hard for us to manage so we

94
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,490
import interesting features so we use

95
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,360
binary log compression on the learning

96
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
networks so because we have a

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,650
geographically distributed my skill

98
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,410
replication environment so the reducing

99
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,320
of network sites turning out Todd Palin

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,960
transferring from master to slaves is

101
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,200
pretty important to reduce networks so

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,960
but the top thread country it's not the

103
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,090
same so that said compress its final log

104
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,030
with the live then sending to the

105
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,750
threads but this happens to all of them

106
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,910
for the threads so if there are tens

107
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,710
let's then the dump sent needs to

108
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,530
compress the same binary so ten times

109
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,900
for all the slaves so this is pretty

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,479
inefficient and the Delian compression

111
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,419
uses a lot of CPUs so countries that we

112
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,270
have a CPU usage on the issue of the

113
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,370
mass society so we are working in

114
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,590
progress to this switch to G standard

115
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,260
which is a newer and the much more

116
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,180
superior to taint compression format to

117
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,130
save the CPU usage on the bin of the

118
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,920
absent and the real stem sink

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,950
replication so we use was the same thing

120
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,190
to prevent petals on the during fade

121
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,680
over and we have multiple databases

122
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,170
within the instance so create database

123
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,330
so we have multiple databases under the

124
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,220
use multi-threaded strength on this

125
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,620
website to leave us a new program but

126
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,740
hopefully so the only the single must

127
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,780
have multiple slaves only matters for my

128
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,020
dogs so others pretty much independent

129
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,410
from a storage engine so just something

130
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,470
about sled dump my my house so the

131
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,780
second point its - tables with optimal

132
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,090
current family options so the wrong City

133
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,460
as Mark said there are lots of

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,400
parameters for her lock city so this

135
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
means the might of trucks built on

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,280
parameters and most parameters the

137
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,940
dependent on the chrome family so the my

138
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,230
looks are two important features

139
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,430
concerning about column options

140
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,320
the wines index Oh daddy so Facebook has

141
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,210
you can support like a Facebook newsfeed

142
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,560
so this is fixed by an order by x

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,530
descending so the most of the Facebook's

144
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,370
bark aerobics latest macro is descending

145
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,490
scales so this means the descending

146
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,680
scale has to be fast enough for Roxy B

147
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,640
so the by default the rocks tables scan

148
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,520
ordering is pretty old optimized for

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,789
ascending scales so we need different

150
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,790
formats so another format the optimized

151
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,330
for angel descending scales so we call

152
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,240
this as a device or that company so the

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,070
button that come from this specifies the

154
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,770
data Thornton operate before that which

155
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,930
means the pretty optimized for this

156
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,870
industry

157
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,300
and broom filter if sprinkled ice extent

158
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,120
for makes the pointer oh I could

159
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,830
the range can be called política it's

160
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,250
fast enough so the Blue Peter needs to

161
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,190
specify group that aims which is how you

162
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,500
dependent on the index size so this

163
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,360
means if you have a many different types

164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,330
of indexes that you need to you really

165
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,930
need will need to configure different

166
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,160
Brimfield options which means you need

167
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,820
have one fulfilled come families so we

168
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,890
are still working in progress to make

169
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,550
this more robust and efficient for

170
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,900
specifying couple of leaders or come

171
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,300
families but anyway so the most minor of

172
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,089
software's options are come family land

173
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,240
h my dog's index parameter specified

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,900
current family

175
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,960
so in collections to be classified in

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,900
the case on our main database for

177
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,480
limited number of similar current family

178
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,820
types like a node or link or the

179
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,279
increase device owner or others so we

180
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,600
have visited a few companies then

181
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,620
mapping many indexes into the boundaries

182
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,690
for contaminants

183
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,800
so data rolling so we implemented our

184
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,870
coding feature in my logs to make

185
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,570
ancient migration from my baby to my

186
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,910
talks faster so directly creating so by

187
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,100
default the Roxie bits right pass is

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,110
writing to mem table that many

189
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,600
compactions happens to run eventually

190
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,450
writing to support on most levels so

191
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,390
which requires liking that see

192
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,510
forget about megabytes like like results

193
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,170
in a couple more right attending about

194
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,510
stats it still it since I already but

195
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,340
still writing much many more than

196
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,950
original data so we implemented a

197
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,480
patrolling features in Malik's

198
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,120
which creates the data files in the

199
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,110
bottom mode 7 directory on even so which

200
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,940
means all bypassing all meant debut

201
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,760
lights and the compactions so primary

202
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,980
key can be controlled by system variable

203
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,080
and called The Rock City Park Road which

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,240
by specifying that top zones

205
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,230
damn everything is written directly but

206
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,570
loading data must be received by primary

207
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,900
kids so this is a comment but for usin

208
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,100
vibration it doesn't bother because

209
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Steve's nicely done a - - Oliver primary

210
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,080
then it's guaranteed that the data

211
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,410
present data was sorted by primary key

212
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,990
and secondary kids so we added the first

213
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,510
index creation so the table at index

214
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,850
create index automatically uses for

215
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,840
clothing for the secondary keys

216
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,720
so this is basic data migration steps

217
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,740
was so great table with no data from my

218
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,040
setup then creating my log tables then

219
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,060
alter table top indexes because to use

220
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,400
the past index list there by still down

221
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,760
the post occur in the baby then pipe the

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,130
my scale they need to come and said

223
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,650
let's cable being called 0 and sit toxic

224
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,839
bar code a code 0

225
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,670
so this is a typo so dogs embark on

226
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,370
recon 1 then all the tables out the

227
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,440
index then using a passing expedition

228
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,160
then after finishing that the start slip

229
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,390
so we our hardware so we could migrate

230
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,760
about 1 terabyte in our instances in

231
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,850
just 1 or 1.5 hours which is pretty good

232
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,700
from my vision performance point of view

233
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,290
so it's a data loading aside from data

234
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,410
loading so another very critical the

235
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,190
comic for us was we don't return the

236
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,860
wrong results to clients so the data

237
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,640
rectification

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,980
so my looks it's little bitty new

239
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,589
database technology so not just us so

240
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,820
many people like here might care about

241
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,030
Goldie

242
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,400
so the might have more bugs and robust a

243
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,160
new disease in release robust it has

244
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,320
over 10 years of histories but the rock

245
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
step is very new so yeah so people care

246
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,130
about the vows so then the consistency

247
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,260
is some are the most important be

248
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,140
comments generally not just us but from

249
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,510
our communities

250
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,670
so we know verification testitude to

251
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,400
check the data consistency between

252
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,010
inaudible one block city or just singer

253
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,650
to my dog state consistencies so we have

254
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,740
couple of tests so why is a index count

255
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,380
check between primary key and secondary

256
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,670
keys so this is the counting the

257
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,220
mismatch if if there are mismatches the

258
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,660
drains at primary key and second of the

259
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,940
key color low colors for the same table

260
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,970
then this is something wrong

261
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,840
so this is the basic check test and it

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,080
doesn't mean you know just running a

263
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,330
statement like this so select count from

264
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,780
a force was index primary Union the

265
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,640
select count from a force index

266
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,270
secondary key then this is a same

267
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,460
transaction scopes statements so the no

268
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,040
count has to be the same it's the row

269
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,840
contains different than the data is

270
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,100
broken so has to be after in the scale

271
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,340
so we started using the to fall under

272
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,490
checked all tables with secondary kids

273
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,400
then and we fixed most of the

274
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,010
outstanding issues before they point in

275
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,180
position the parties index start step

276
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,650
the statistics so the takings estimated

277
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,290
locals like a show table status if it's

278
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,130
part different from action like local

279
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,300
states wrong so this the funny thing is

280
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,370
the responder bug that the park rolling

281
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,780
didn't obtain statistics so that was the

282
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,970
fact so the sodium we say the students

283
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,080
are zero row counts for Barbie on the

284
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,770
table so it's bumpy the records so

285
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,720
hopefully these two detected the problem

286
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,140
before they play introduction

287
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,630
and the third part is take samples

288
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,060
between ready so comparing between

289
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,529
innovating instance of Murdock's

290
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,850
instance so this is the is a bit tricky

291
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,310
school scripting so basically what we

292
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,880
did was logical start on locks on with

293
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,470
consistent snapshot it's the same GT ID

294
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,839
positions between in Radium Murdock's

295
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,660
instance then getting the stopping

296
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
slaves then finding the gjd position

297
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,130
then the starting transaction with the

298
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,160
same G getting snapshot then running the

299
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,010
same query same table cells then the

300
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,800
result has to be consistent so by

301
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,910
running a query same comparing Texans

302
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,089
shadow correctness stick is another

303
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,519
important feature for us but so let me

304
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,529
check about shadow death so we have a

305
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,170
subtle taste remark for capturing read

306
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,579
and write queries from production

307
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,820
instances then they'll be playing them

308
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,269
into a shadow a test master instance

309
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,029
muscles living senses so we have our

310
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,190
custom all deep ravines to capture

311
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,510
traffic's capture queries then we have a

312
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,640
logging framework all describe then the

313
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,829
capturing queries then starting with the

314
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,470
data warehouse then deplaned them into a

315
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,500
server connect with each other instances

316
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,350
and we call we did that on other

317
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,230
shadowmaster days before the pro master

318
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,019
instances so detecting client errors or

319
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,800
finding queries relying on gap talk so

320
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,500
we have passed several commands to this

321
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,130
top queries again gapper then fix them

322
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,579
before the products

323
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,670
so not ambitious and Harvey fix was

324
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,199
blossomed snaps of conflict areas which

325
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,109
is so my dog's production implementation

326
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,050
so it's site selection implementation

327
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,150
it's a bit different from in Arabia so

328
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,250
Minox implemented is pretty close to

329
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,059
post aggressive style and it's by

330
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,990
default isolations repeatable date then

331
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,980
customers and my rock style

332
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,250
repeatability may return Terra's

333
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,330
call the snapshot conflict areas where

334
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,890
the inner baby silently are plaguing

335
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,700
conflict so it means users may get more

336
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,020
errors and they yeah so we notice that

337
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,690
and we decided to switch to leader

338
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,590
committed for the major great then the

339
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,650
leader committed fix the problem and

340
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,870
another it should be interesting should

341
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,550
be found for slaves stopped desire

342
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,390
errors on these so and so this senator

343
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,550
is something States and it may take time

344
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,429
for automation tool to detect them so

345
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:09,770
which switch to make the most my hopes

346
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,290
are board or the critical io errors from

347
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,830
services from our most recent lights and

348
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,200
index a mystic starts I said I said

349
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,740
other sport or activity low currents on

350
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,010
park loading so we fixed up and yes

351
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,800
three parking progress about that it in

352
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,110
Xcode notice that assistance has not

353
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,360
been as accurate as in the baby so we

354
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,220
are working in progress in optimizing

355
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,450
that but so we country we have worked

356
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,130
around to settings I think you can't

357
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,290
index time limit so it is it about

358
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,690
myself I've pumped up from five six to

359
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,160
zero so the using index type to this

360
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,640
rate statistics and if if we fix some

361
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,030
crosswalks in my dog's angle

362
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,040
and compaction stores is heavy right so

363
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,570
this we often see in production so heavy

364
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,580
that forming lots of compaction which

365
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,280
make all stars for the observe stores on

366
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,470
schema changes we use on a schema things

367
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,170
too so yeah it's a big difference from

368
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,640
github so the ghost but we have all love

369
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,190
silicon - so it's basically creating

370
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,530
tables with own schema change and the

371
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,540
clicking tables the previously Lord too

372
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,550
much - mm table and of course with too

373
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,880
many confessions which stole

374
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,470
applications for about 10 seconds even

375
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,980
though it's called a nice image sensor

376
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,590
so we added the perk loading feature and

377
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,010
the first index creation feature and we

378
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,100
made on a schema since to to use them to

379
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,970
avoid Compassion's and we also used

380
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,130
different compression algorithms for

381
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,800
noxious letters so doc city has multiple

382
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,580
levels and the about ninety percent of

383
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,590
data is starting the bottom was later
