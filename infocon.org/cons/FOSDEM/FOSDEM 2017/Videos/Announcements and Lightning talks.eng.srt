2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:24,369
because you think it's hard so we're

3
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,140
going to 18 will curl application I use

4
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,080
CGI can I also going through my what's

5
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,460
this other website that you should write

6
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,900
down you should go to Observatory about

7
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,049
mozilla.org put in the URL to your bank

8
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,360
all right and go there and it will give

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,100
you a bank a letter grade your bank's

10
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,689
website a letter grade I almost

11
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,479
guarantee you to bank will get an X okay

12
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,850
most applications we get at this is a

13
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,630
subjective arbitrary not not exactly

14
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,250
fair range

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,590
it is meant to cause you to do things

16
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,540
that are secure one of the things it'll

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,670
cost you to do is implement content

18
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,590
security policy if you want to really

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,910
high rate and also make sure you're not

20
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,580
using cookies that are us that are not

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,710
such as specific and some other things

22
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,600
and with all the show it to you right

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,060
now there's a my bank you can have many

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,400
some federal sites actually managed to

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,860
get like a d-minus however the site that

26
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,570
I maintain which is the month the bugs

27
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,459
he'll install that runs most of it's an

28
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,490
a-minus so my 18 year old their 20 year

29
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,340
old proposition using CGI cam it's a

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,720
better security rating than like -

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,070
thanks for cleaning possibly more

32
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,650
informants things like my bank we don't

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,120
have any money I said that's so what did

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,670
you do it scan this on scan your own

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,730
site tell your boss that you need to do

36
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,920
this and then hopefully at the next

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,150
parole conference I'll give you a

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,560
compliment of mantra that you can use

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,940
first defining it from that security

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,940
policy on a per-page Oh awesome

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,150
so this is my help odd means or is it

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,540
recording

43
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,530
[Music]

44
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,090
okay so I'm just gonna rustle stuffy and

45
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,780
that's equal sign and enter I have no

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,859
idea what there's gonna be a sentence

47
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,840
can be poor so see if it's been scanned

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,459
before we actually catch the results in

49
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,780
you did if their chance to settle for a

50
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,109
bunch of headers it's particularly

51
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,970
heinous blinds now there you go so

52
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,730
security policy so concentration things

53
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,919
are a time-release that are now except

54
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,449
with a secure flag so you can get them

55
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,630
over plain HTTP cross-origin resource

56
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,089
sharing is not disabled probably no

57
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,740
public key pinning no strict Transport

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,320
Security a redirection with the final

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,810
destination is not each yes doesn't have

60
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,199
a return policy

61
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,660
[Music]

62
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,050
all right meanwhile that's my say I

63
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,210
three years I have a freaking A+ but

64
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,389
it's pretty old it's using CGI p.m. but

65
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,129
I can do this and actually I don't like

66
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,180
this on every page but I have this

67
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,080
awesome moment we make it so you to do

68
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,258
this

69
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,409
meanwhile not that I have no problem

70
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,680
