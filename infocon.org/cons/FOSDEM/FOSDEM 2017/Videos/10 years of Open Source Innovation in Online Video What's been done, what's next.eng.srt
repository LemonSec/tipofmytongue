1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,559
so here is a baby from Kailua we'll

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,440
introduce us with the console

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,180
simulations of Quechua in online

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,070
training thank you

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,570
so my name is Robin I work at Cal try an

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,660
open source video platform and ever

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,939
since 2006 we basically looked at the

8
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,250
world of online video and said there

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,829
needs to be something for a video at

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,829
large-scale what we'll do today is

11
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,190
basically kind of go through a ten year

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,489
brief history lesson if you will but

13
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,230
then through Deadpool talk about you

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,850
know what Cal tries in in what we've

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,120
done so far and I will finish with a

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,679
look into the future and what we're

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,980
working on and what we would love your

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,039
help with so ten years in under ten

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,109
minutes

20
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,780
so interestingly those should be

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,260
checkmarks

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:16,760
so our story begins in in 2006 were

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,140
basically YouTube did sort of

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,940
transformation in how the world sees

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,200
video and how people behave online the

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,180
world basically shifted from text to

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,080
video in nearly a year basically YouTube

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,410
lunched YouTube reached millions every

29
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,770
snow is now you know you did with a

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,300
camera can be a VIP and suddenly

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,820
everybody cares about video and bam

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,830
google buys them for about three billion

33
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,030
dollar so what's interesting is you know

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,310
what we what we started seeing is videos

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,250
mostly video online is mostly driven by

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,080
user-generated content and by

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,840
advertisers this is where the majority

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,139
of video

39
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,800
online kind of existed it wasn't just

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,050
YouTube but it was mostly YouTube and

41
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,580
that's what that was basically the

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,630
premise of Kaltura

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,820
so there's some numbers here but some

44
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,130
interesting kind of evolution of online

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,830
video but then where Kaltura was

46
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,390
launched was that the inflection point

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,000
of video is becoming a standard and as

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,590
video is becoming a start out there's

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,950
also a standard in technology for video

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,680
so the video element is being proposed

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,130
in 2007 Caltrain comm cooperative video

52
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,870
editing is launched and basically the

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,870
premise was there's YouTube there's

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,990
Wikipedia but there's nothing that does

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,420
both so you can upload video you can

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,520
share video but you can freely cooperate

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,170
on video you can feel like you edit

58
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,290
video together you can work with people

59
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,260
on video online and the premise was

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,500
there there's a huge opportunity here

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
because lots of people are going to use

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,520
video in the future it's going to be the

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,190
dominating kind of theta asset the way

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,340
that we communicate online and we need

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,860
the capabilities to actually handle this

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,269
at scale so 2008 started alongside

67
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,580
proposing the video element by Oprah

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,340
back then what was interesting is it

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,620
didn't really catch on so the first word

70
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,630
browser came in they said here's the

71
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,700
video suggestion this is how we see

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,070
video online this is the suggestion for

73
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,739
html5 video nobody really cared nobody

74
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,450
really went ahead and implemented it

75
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,769
there wasn't really a standard around it

76
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,500
and there was not enough driving force

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,269
so we went ahead and actually launched

78
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,010
get it with Mozilla and the creative

79
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,350
comments and yell and a bunch of others

80
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,120
an organization called open video

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Alliance the open video Alliance had a

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,530
few conferences do you open video

83
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,600
conference and the goal was to basically

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,450
bring everybody together in one room to

85
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,220
talk about the future of video to create

86
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,630
open standards around video alongside we

87
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,120
grew as a platform we grew as a kind of

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,950
a place where people collaborate and

89
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,850
place where people create video together

90
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,860
we did all sorts of interesting projects

91
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,350
together with Mozilla together with a

92
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,930
lot of different creators online that

93
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,040
basically went ahead and create

94
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,870
documentaries where lots of people

95
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,700
around the world could actually upload

96
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,680
video and collaborate online we've

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,810
actually built this video editor online

98
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,750
and so on and the year ends with 2009

99
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,340
sorry sorry we started seeing video

100
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,810
being adopted in other places not just

101
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,720
online in in the public sense not just

102
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,200
the UGC / advertising environment but

103
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,860
also in education so the the evil the

104
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,590
evolution is now a revolution in certain

105
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,480
industries and engine and in the world

106
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,860
of Education we're actually starting to

107
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,890
see revolution of Education just because

108
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,200
a video we most learning is now a thing

109
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,830
flipped classroom is now important

110
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,360
professors or star are actually starting

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,330
to take their classes online and MOOCs

112
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,140
are actually starting to get to be born

113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,840
another interesting thing is the outcome

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,460
of those those collaborations with

115
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,100
Mozilla and companies like that and this

116
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,110
is actually clickable you can after that

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,510
if you want to kind of go through the

118
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,040
presentation and actually see the videos

119
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,460
that you can click on of people this is

120
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,530
mark from the Mozilla Foundation talking

121
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,270
about the the Open Video Alliance

122
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,000
implies it's important anyway the

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,670
outcome was adoption begins browsers are

124
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,140
actually know care and they were

125
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,330
starting to implement video natively

126
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,120
flash is now being treated as a fallback

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,340
not as the main tool so 2009 continues

128
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,230
starting 2010 what we're starting to see

129
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,500
is video is is getting more important

130
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,810
it's getting more embedded it's getting

131
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,370
more native in different sorts of

132
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,220
applications and more video you create

133
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,020
the more metadata you need to produce

134
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,450
out of it the more complicated the

135
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,730
workflow has become it's not just about

136
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,740
uploading video from a user device it's

137
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,240
about uploading video from mobile

138
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,249
devices it's about

139
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,529
ingesting and scheduling a video from

140
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,629
multiple different places multiple

141
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,279
different solutions like here we have

142
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,039
sort of a lecture capture box that the

143
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,159
guys that fought them built so there's

144
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,789
there's a myriad of sources of how we

145
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,009
ingest content fast for today we

146
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,469
actually have lots of different video

147
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:55,289
sources including dashcam that policeman

148
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,129
wears for example alongside that there's

149
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,549
also lots of sources for metadata so how

150
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,139
do you produce metadata from that video

151
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,229
but also the metadata that correlates to

152
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,689
that video where was the video taken who

153
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,759
took the video in what context the video

154
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,299
was taking Werder IRT sensors around

155
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,279
that video that correlate to what that

156
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,919
video is showing and so on and so forth

157
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,249
so now it becomes sort of a challenge of

158
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:28,110
managing lots and lots of data and it's

159
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,329
it's a complicated data because

160
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,099
oftentimes you can't really extract the

161
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,829
information easily and it becomes a big

162
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,959
data problem it becomes a complex

163
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,059
problem of how you deal with multiple

164
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,119
different types of metadata unstructured

165
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:45,179
mostly and lastly what was interesting

166
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:47,219
is we're starting to see a blurring of

167
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,889
the lines between VOD in life so it's no

168
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,689
longer just you upload a video it's also

169
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,789
now I'm broadcasting a video or in

170
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,979
broadcasting a video that the source is

171
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,409
actually an on-demand video that I have

172
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,099
on my computer and vice versa so the

173
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,860
consumers at the end of the day the

174
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,110
users who are using using an application

175
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,889
where video is important they're

176
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,749
starting to expect a lot of different

177
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,309
capabilities a lot of different

178
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:16,919
experiences and that complicates things

179
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,769
on the back end this is where Kaltura is

180
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:24,389
born so back in 2008 it was mostly a

181
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,369
website right YouTube meets Wikipedia

182
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,409
let's do a our collaborative being you

183
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,969
online in 2009 we kind of sit back look

184
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,919
at look at how people use what we've

185
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,370
built and and go huh

186
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,110
there might be something you're bigger

187
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,809
here and really the

188
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,209
the next step forward was to build a

189
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,240
platform completely open-source that

190
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
people can use to build their own

191
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,100
experiences online and together with all

192
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,209
those assumptions and all those

193
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,770
realizations that video is going to be

194
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,290
massive at scale it's going to be

195
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,970
required in many different workflows in

196
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,950
many different applications people are

197
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,050
going to need a platform to handle those

198
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,760
workflows to handle all those different

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,300
solutions and put them together and we

200
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,760
put together this kind of manifesto of

201
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,070
what would the platform look like what

202
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,260
is important you know from things like

203
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,399
horizontal scalability to the ability to

204
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,170
handle things in different systems and

205
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,810
being backward compatible and so on 2010

206
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,500
Steve Jobs sticks the floor and says

207
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,140
html5 is king everybody should dump

208
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,339
flash well who that

209
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,089
long live html5 now we have now we have

210
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,680
standards now people actually do care

211
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,899
now the web is actually progressing

212
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,209
faster and we're starting to see a lot

213
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,850
more applications popcorn genius is born

214
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,620
we're starting to see a lot of

215
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,750
interactivity on the web alongside video

216
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,980
it's not just video it's video

217
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,279
experiences we're starting to see a lot

218
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,670
of different embedded workflows with

219
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,520
video where videos kind of the main

220
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,920
asset so in education for example we're

221
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,360
starting to see video being used for

222
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,570
assessments it's now actually counting

223
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,560
against your grade as a student during

224
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,570
that year those two years we actually

225
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,160
make two main launches caltrop version 2

226
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,339
and culture of version 3 it's now a

227
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,300
massive platform capable of handling a

228
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,120
very large scale of video the internet

229
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,709
doctor archive is actually starting to

230
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,410
use Kaltura too alongside Wikipedia and

231
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,400
adoption is growing very fast 2012 till

232
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,040
2014 we're starting to see massive

233
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,889
of adoption all over many different use

234
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,600
cases many different environments from

235
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,360
healthcare to education to surveillance

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,279
even and in a lot of a lot of those

237
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,680
years were around stabilizing the

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,810
platform creating all sorts of tools

239
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,899
around it working working with the

240
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,300
community to create all sorts of

241
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,870
future-proof were closed so that he'll

242
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,040
be able to handle large-scale video in

243
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,209
the back end that years kind of ending

244
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,610
with the release of a real-time packager

245
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,310
that we've built based on engine ik

246
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,199
everybody here knows Ingenix the beauty

247
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,509
of it is being able to handle massive

248
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,569
amounts of connections and what's

249
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,370
interesting it's it's very useful for

250
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,529
video so if you wrote a module that

251
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,509
basically does real-time packaging of

252
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,579
video formats and we'll talk about this

253
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:51,970
later

254
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,209
in more detail but that's the year it

255
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,600
was starting to release so around 2015

256
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,750
we start launching standardized

257
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,870
installation packages for culture so

258
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,079
launching of our PMS and Deb's and then

259
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,069
furthermore and we're starting to see

260
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,810
significant growth those are actual

261
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,069
installation numbers over the years and

262
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:16,839
that number is kind of hockey sneaking

263
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,760
right now and it's really exciting

264
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,449
because it really shows that now you

265
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,120
know back 10 years back when we looked

266
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,209
at this world of online video you know

267
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,569
we kind of envisioned where video is

268
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,519
going to be used massively across many

269
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,370
different workflows but we can't even

270
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,380
you know begin to think about the the

271
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,939
size and the skill that this will take

272
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,660
so those this was like a fast-food ten

273
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,360
years let's talk about a few notable

274
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,670
Foss projects that we have that you can

275
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,769
check out first of all obviously the

276
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,790
platform itself you can install it from

277
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,329
the platform packages the RPM and dams

278
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,300
we also

279
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,280
provide chef and all sorts of other

280
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,190
deployment capabilities the source code

281
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,370
for the backend which is mostly PHP is

282
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,710
over here and then there is the player

283
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,310
which we'll talk about in a bit as well

284
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,040
really what it's all about is handling

285
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,590
everything in the world of video from a

286
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,840
back-end perspective right so handling

287
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,150
multiple interest points handling video

288
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,680
at scale in terms of your storage in

289
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,210
terms of your delivery in terms of your

290
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,640
processing managing transcoding queues

291
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,610
all those kind of things then there's

292
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,770
the nginx packager that we've talked

293
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,110
about so on the fly packaging for many

294
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,480
different formats including encryption

295
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,420
and drm thumbnail capture in real-time

296
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,460
clipping in real-time stitching in

297
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,500
real-time all sorts of things like

298
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,070
subtitles and multi multi audio tracks

299
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,360
and so on

300
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,120
really I really recommend checking this

301
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,340
out if you have a project that requires

302
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,240
both real-time packaging a video it does

303
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,780
both live and VOD today and it can also

304
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,940
handle the mix between them so if we

305
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,230
talked before about blurring of the

306
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,410
lines there's those type of technologies

307
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,120
this is what they do right they enable

308
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,980
you to kind of treat video as a video

309
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,990
and it doesn't matter if it's live or if

310
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,880
it's VOD if it's law if it's really it

311
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,590
can become live if it's live it can

312
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,200
become a VOD and really the user

313
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,250
shouldn't really care MW embed web

314
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,610
standard video player the reason it's

315
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,380
called by the way MW embed is because

316
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,000
originally we wrote it for Wikipedia

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
together with the media wiki foundation

318
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,250
so we actually had Cal turians working

319
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,100
in the Wikipedia offices embedding video

320
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,640
into Wikipedia and that's how MW embed

321
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,910
was born really the goal of it was to

322
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,280
kind of create a unified standards

323
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,040
player that doesn't really care what

324
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,840
platform you're running on what device

325
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,580
you're running on it will make sure the

326
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,670
video it works then it grew very very

327
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,830
significantly to hundreds of plugins and

328
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,990
customizations and there are all sorts

329
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,140
of things for interactivity or for you

330
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,110
know cue points and so on all the way to

331
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,070
custom

332
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,230
custom looks in skins and so on and we

333
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,269
also have what you see is what you get

334
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,339
sort of player studio where you can go

335
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:21,589
in and kind of change the how things

336
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,800
look like and add your own plugins and

337
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,149
so on and we'll talk a bit about this in

338
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,420
in a bit lastly there is a REST API

339
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,550
client generator so we kind of took a

340
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,149
different approach to REST API there's a

341
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,610
blog post here that I highly recommend

342
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,180
writing what's interesting about this

343
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,519
and I won't go over to list but you can

344
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,790
go on and check also the there's a link

345
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,560
to the github repository inside the blog

346
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,319
post is really one of the massive

347
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,240
challenges that we had was to deal with

348
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,970
massive scale and at the same time of

349
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,329
having horizontal scalability we had to

350
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,779
deal with lots of lots of limitations of

351
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,579
enterprises right so where people would

352
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,250
want to deploy culture in an enterprise

353
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,560
environment or in education a university

354
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,089
environment where there's lots of lots

355
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,690
of firewall keep rules in complexities

356
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,610
how do you deal with all those things

357
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,600
and so we had to come up with a REST API

358
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
that is simple just like rest but at the

359
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,230
same time circumvents a lot of the a lot

360
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,180
of the limitations that normal REST API

361
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,339
have and in addition to that there's

362
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:38,930
also things that are specific to the

363
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,519
world of online video like handling

364
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,069
large files which most REST API is don't

365
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,190
deal with Jam is another interesting

366
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,850
application it's actually a PHP module

367
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,600
so I highly recommend looking into if

368
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,300
you guys have PHP applications this

369
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,949
basically runs on the PHP level and

370
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,480
helps you do logging very easily and

371
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,350
very quickly

372
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,890
so a little bit of information about

373
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,689
what people do with culture today and

374
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,020
over the years not your white hides a

375
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,760
few lines here but this is basically

376
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,490
saying healthcare and this is saying

377
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,109
government they think really

378
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,000
interestingly so we saw you know

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,380
thousands of deployments and so on

380
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,690
literally all over the world we're

381
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,820
starting to see it using an embedded

382
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,920
natively many different applications

383
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,200
many different environments but then

384
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,260
this is really interesting is as time

385
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,140
goes by we actually started around here

386
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,260
so in the early days the majority of

387
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,210
deployments were distribution of video

388
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,390
and things like you know advertising and

389
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,340
so on nowadays we're starting to see

390
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,380
significant growth into areas like

391
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,410
telemedicine or healthcare patient

392
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,640
videos or all sorts of capabilities

393
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,150
around workflows around places where

394
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,110
video was not naturally you know used a

395
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,660
lot and now it's actually kind of almost

396
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,120
transforming an entire industry we're

397
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,230
starting to see that a lot with

398
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,960
compliance and safety in in construction

399
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
and so on

400
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,530
so really interesting interesting

401
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,630
caltrans not just for video but it

402
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,640
really is you know the focus was video

403
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,380
and everything around it so because

404
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,090
video is so complex

405
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,310
I generally handles a lot of different

406
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,590
assets around that video so it's sort of

407
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,300
an asset management system and people

408
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,860
actually use it to manage all sorts of

409
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,860
data type in various sizes and scales

410
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,930
all sorts of different companies all

411
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,630
over the world from government to media

412
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,650
companies and healthcare and so on

413
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,660
really interesting slide if you get to

414
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,030
go on the presentation you could

415
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,040
actually click on it and see what they

416
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,670
do where do people and deploy we're

417
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,620
still seeing most of the people to plan

418
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,020
our own environments but there's a

419
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,800
significant growth into public clouds so

420
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
this is sort of the distribution that

421
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,820
we're seeing today and it's also sort of

422
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,280
an indication of who are the strong guy

423
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,840
as players I guess so what's next

424
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,760
I really have 50 seconds so we've spent

425
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
a lot of time building new developer

426
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,300
tools you can check them out developers

427
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,240
CARICOM lots of interactive recipe

428
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,640
system there's some innovation around

429
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,330
the how you guide people through

430
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,929
rest api's and so on native SDKs and new

431
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,239
web standards flares or actually we just

432
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,249
launched new native SDKs for the player

433
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,070
for native ios and android we're

434
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,539
actually starting to work on a new

435
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,109
player so kind of getting rid of a lot

436
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,719
of the legacy of MediaWiki and the old

437
00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:00,919
days real time for two main reasons one

438
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,959
is because the lines are completely

439
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,809
blurring again between live and VOD and

440
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,389
and real-time is definitely a big part

441
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,029
of it but also because there's a need to

442
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:13,789
support Lorde broadcaster and multi

443
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:18,109
multi participant experiences and we're

444
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,719
actually seeing a lot of demand for that

445
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,629
machine so everything around sort of AEI

446
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:26,629
and the ability to kind of describe the

447
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:28,070
video better and extract information

448
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,450
from it the future of yaar and all sorts

449
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,429
of things around simplicity of

450
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:37,369
deployment and simplicity of scaling and

451
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,499
monitoring and so on and definitely if

452
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,049
you want to participate if you want to

453
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,119
share your thoughts let us know

454
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:54,309
[Applause]

455
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,650
[Music]

456
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,720
no so kalter is completely open-source

457
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,460
you need to repeat it with them oh yeah

458
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,670
sorry let me make sure that I understood

459
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,430
your question you asked if they're large

460
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,870
companies using culture are actually

461
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,960
paying for culture so culture is

462
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,150
completely open source it's under a GPL

463
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,100
you could just go ahead and install it

464
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,250
yourself and all the logos that you've

465
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,140
seen they're actually using it for free

466
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,200
completely but there we also provide

467
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,640
commercial services

468
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,980
and we have a cloud of our own so a lot

469
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,510
a lot of people don't want to install

470
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,040
themselves they just want to get a

471
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,620
service and they simply buy from

472
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,710
our hosted service and so yes there was

473
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,770
a mix other questions

474
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,250
yeah it's a good question so the

475
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,580
question was basically around VR and

476
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,080
what what we plan to do around that

477
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,910
around specifically around stitching so

478
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,250
today what we do in terms of stitching

479
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,840
is basically the idea of clipping and

480
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,300
stitching right so you get a long video

481
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,550
and you can you know clip out of it or

482
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,320
take multiple videos and then stitch

483
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,809
them together but that's not really

484
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,460
stitching in the sense of the are we're

485
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,770
in VR you would get like a 360 video and

486
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,420
flip it or trim it into like multiple

487
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,210
quadrants so or cubicles and so on and

488
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,980
then in terms of looking into the future

489
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,190
there I guess two things one is better

490
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,340
support for 360 which we already

491
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,110
released version one version two is

492
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,420
gonna a little bit more support in

493
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,600
the farther future I guess in terms of

494
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
VR specifically it's also about

495
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,500
interactivity the ability to navigate

496
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,750
within the video the ability to

497
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,220
communicate between the server so
