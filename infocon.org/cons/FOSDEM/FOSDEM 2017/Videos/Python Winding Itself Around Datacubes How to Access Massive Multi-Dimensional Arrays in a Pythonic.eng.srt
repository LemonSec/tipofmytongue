[Music]

3
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,170
at least that's what we think

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,550
after all we monitor the earth and its

5
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,400
weather patterns from outer space we

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,979
measure the Earth's surface

7
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,930
and peered in or deepest deaths and

8
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,299
today's warming of optimal hardware and

9
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,149
intelligent software mankind is

10
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,460
reverting to the status of hunter and

11
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,549
gatherers researchers from all over the

12
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,069
world are compiling a vast and very

13
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,000
valuable resource data about our planet

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,288
Earth this data affords a new glimpse of

15
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,110
our planet the ongoing exploration of

16
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,629
the world has entered the era of big

17
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,599
data but this development console

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,540
harbors some big problems keeping track

19
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
of the data making sense of it is one of

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,400
the biggest challenges facing mankind

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,239
today

22
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,548
and

23
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,000
so it's

24
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,160
and that is what some people like to

25
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,340
call a data so a programming wise it's

26
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,710
just a minor array which can be pretty

27
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,050
good in practice that runs out of the

28
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,290
sensor data images or 2d arrays or in

29
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,360
time seriously dimensional arrays

30
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,940
simulation output or statistical data

31
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
tools so that's what you more or less

32
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,310
have in terms of application see okay

33
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,470
that's a keeper so let's do

34
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:22,349
and this

35
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,810
this for you you can search maybe

36
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,060
process so you can filter you can select

37
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,320
and suddenly data and metadata if you

38
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
turn the other cheek go together in form

39
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,300
one uniform information space so that

40
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,560
should make life much easier so we don't

41
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,300
need to think in terms of another side

42
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,900
by encoded and what the spectrometer so

43
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,000
that is something that is not keep going

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,490
into the second committee truck and

45
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,280
third water or this year you're going to

46
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,620
[Music]

47
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,669
trust us today

48
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,700
okay so that is

49
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
so

50
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,670
okay everything

51
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,240
not already submitted from the data for

52
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,079
which you wanted

53
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,870
and do an encoding on every Sunday

54
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,139
special so that is the idea computer

55
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,560
language

56
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:40,550
so you want to try it out yourself

57
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,670
and standards the customer but complices

58
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,070
maze there for advertising or TC

59
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,350
standards and showing how they came up

60
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,630
in practice but you can go to a rusty or

61
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,350
console and type in stuff like then you

62
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,620
see clear it out there and then you get

63
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,490
a result so

64
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:54,350
and which I want to get the fastest and

65
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,760
everything else just to something

66
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,250
meaningful Vidya senses so and is the

67
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,990
storage and we have is receding

68
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:42,790
so this way

69
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
we will put this tube set into the

70
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,900
Federation and if so suddenly the

71
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,800
satellite becomes available

72
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,540
but I hasten to say yes we like this

73
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,180
language because of its flexibility but

74
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,130
we are very very aware that this is

75
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,070
nothing that users want to see we do not

76
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,610
see this

77
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,709
no you see this as a convenient

78
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,760
client-server program

79
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,049
[Music]

80
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:58,009
okay okay

81
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,019
so that's one thing

82
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:30,130
so we have some explanations fetches

83
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,839
transparently information about what

84
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,589
that one offers

85
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,660
you can access information about the

86
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,380
city coverage

87
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,399
and you can find out what time

88
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,530
so this is

89
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,330
okay the next thing is and this is what

90
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,489
we are working on currently we have a

91
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,149
general enterprise to database as a

92
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,429
packet and then it's actually a mystery

93
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,820
features now take one s we want to call

94
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,700
the Rustom entity language from with any

95
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,529
party so

96
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,480
so that you heard at least on three okay

97
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,309
good thank you I start speaking okay

98
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,140
it's not yet yelling so I can speak up

99
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,360
again so where we stand now is you still

100
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,280
need to establish a collection and then

101
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,320
you say okay mr is an object that

102
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
actually is from a rastaman collection

103
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,610
of that same name this is the

104
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,410
information you need to give to Python

105
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,840
so that they can do the following I do

106
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,050
my operations as usual in - these are

107
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,940
not evaluated until you want to get the

108
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,250
information at that time all these

109
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,250
operations are gathered a string is

110
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,800
generated a query string which is sent

111
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,950
to the server and with the eval function

112
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,620
I get back the array which I can treat

113
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,350
as usual so actually you don't need to

114
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,630
write rescue L operations like this kind

115
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,110
of thing here you just write your Python

116
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,020
code and then it's translated at runtime

117
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,300
into a query this works for some set of

118
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,420
operations not for all okay iterations

119
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,309
for example is something we are still

120
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:09,620
wrapping our minds around and what does

121
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,230
it say not much left so I should hurry

122
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,260
up

123
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,549
so the one thing the whole activity is

124
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,710
embedded into our earth server project

125
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,200
which is financed by the European

126
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,299
Commission co-founded and we are very

127
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,419
glad about this where we do analytics on

128
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,160
three dimensions and four dimensional

129
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,100
data cubes where we have seeded 250

130
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,140
terabytes and the next is crossing the

131
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:42,090
petabytes limit NASA world wind is used

132
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,669
as a client interface here and then we

133
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,120
have Sentinel images from isa ocean

134
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,740
color analysis by Plymouth foreign

135
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,710
laboratory that's the our sleep guy

136
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,850
national computational infrastructure

137
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,950
Australia and the European Centre for

138
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,450
medium-range weather forecasts those

139
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,370
other guys doing the python the jupiter

140
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:05,669
notebooks okay we've been busy also an

141
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,049
open source world for quite some time

142
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,200
and just a little bit about feedback now

143
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,990
from my experience it's also service I

144
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,250
go to meta level we have gone through

145
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,630
six and a half years of OST incubation

146
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,660
that we are not a long as project PI WPS

147
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,490
has taken longer so courage our head a

148
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,530
little bit about the maturity they are

149
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,809
requesting a few things but for example

150
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,070
there is no document

151
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,920
there it's something

152
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,930
open-source world since 2008 but why

153
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,610
does all software have to be free

154
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,780
smaller enterprises and that is

155
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,460
something I would like to give as a

156
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,830
thought to OS geo I know that there are

157
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,900
some like-minded guys there but then

158
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,780
they are the minority by the way the

159
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,520
seconds left are also minority so I

160
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,600
should wrap up we are doing a write

161
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,550
databases generically we want to do

162
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,650
query on massive multi-dimensional

163
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,990
arrays again the query language is just

164
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,540
some internal interface and with Rustom

165
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,460
and community we have some scalable

166
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,830
array engine but we want to hide the

167
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,170
query language path and interface in the

168
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,150
world we are dealing with scientific and

169
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,520
technical data and so we want to

170
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,190
establish support for Python as smooth

171
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,559
as non intrusive as ever possible you

172
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,780
have seen our attempts on that our way

173
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,450
on that that is still ongoing work and

174
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,730
by the way let me finish with the idea

175
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,650
that we are by far not the first one

176
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,330
dealing with multi-dimensional arrays as

177
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,640
you can see Salvador Dali has been

178
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,970
thinking about that long before we did

179
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,460
thank you very much for your attention

180
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,520
you
