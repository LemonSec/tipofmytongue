1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,350
so so hello my name is Eric Lipsky I

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,340
have yes I have I have a little project

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,670
to show which is called puffing we were

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,340
posting for for average users I hope so

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,830
here's it's about making distribution

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,490
simpler for my user so I was wondering

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,650
how to start and actually I would like

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,050
to start from maybe i conventionally a

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,359
bit let's start with a demo and then i

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,850
will give you some some theory i mean

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,649
some some boring stuff how it works so

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,809
okay so how to do a demo like this okay

13
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,250
so this is the this is puffin this is a

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,170
experimental application alright it's a

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,449
web app running on my server so the

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,250
first thing you can take a look as the

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,379
is to learn a bit more about the

18
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,149
application as you see it it's it's so

19
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,469
simple but I'll show ya

20
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,840
so you can you can read some some basic

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,670
stuff so for example getting started we

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,449
should first register so let's register

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,590
so test six let's say yeah email address

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,150
test 6 at luncheonette actually I want I

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,290
want sorry I don't I don't see anything

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,080
yeah oh yeah that's good oops all right

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
so much French keyboards oh my god it's

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,750
actually not important

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,870
wow I cook my name here and password

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,670
well already it's chosen for me okay I

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,620
don't know why I don't know what this

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,980
actually but I just wanted to show you

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,190
if I register yeah so so it will send me

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,800
an email to register to the configure so

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,330
I won't open the email account I will

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,690
just log into the newly created user for

37
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,160
FOSDEM so let's look into to this one so

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,830
after looking in I'm able to actually

39
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,830
install those apps so so what I wanted

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,720
to show you is I will install a blog a

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,920
simple blog so this is this is ghost

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,530
alright so the first thing you can see

43
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,508
okay there's a screenshot the first

44
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,709
thing you are a couple of pinches I mean

45
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,180
the resolution is a bit different I am

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,159
used to so sorry I'm a bit surprised

47
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,170
what's going on here but the

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,849
interesting thing you can do is you can

49
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,330
change the domain DNS I mean to point to

50
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,060
application I actually already changed

51
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,670
it so I put it here you need it's not

52
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,620
fully automated you need a white card on

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,870
your on your domain or by default it

54
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,020
uses puffing rocks because you can also

55
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,400
use it so let's not change it and I can

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,910
just run it so yeah it will take a

57
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,989
minute as you see the I'll see how long

58
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,760
it takes I haven't started from this

59
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,739
user I think so yeah it's actually

60
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,069
what's happening here it's it's starting

61
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,150
container our bunch of containers to run

62
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,060
this up on the server on my server for

63
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,600
now it's just a single machine but yeah

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,459
show you why it's pretty good once we

65
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,560
get here I will I will show you that

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,700
actually this app will be available

67
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,330
right for that so as you see it's the

68
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,950
idea is to keep it one click basically

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,530
so you you click and install your app so

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,530
the idea is to keep it similar to the

71
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,780
familiar for for users to to look like a

72
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,060
mobile app basically or mobile more way

73
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,220
up on the phone you can see the better

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,370
on a bigger screen so I can open my app

75
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,760
so this is a ghost right running you can

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,220
access it also I can post something

77
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:46,930
pretty much yes so I need to set up this

78
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,480
ghost first so I need to create my first

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,750
account so so I can say for them that's

80
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:02,709
my email that sorry I don't know why I'm

81
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,010
doing this well as them passwords let's

82
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,510
keep it secret

83
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,430
I think there's some different password

84
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,599
know they need to repeat it

85
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:26,450
look title okay test no no this is my

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,770
main posture in other words my root

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,130
password is different for all my good no

88
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,590
no no I'll do this later all right I

89
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,660
don't have a team maybe you know unless

90
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,580
you want to invite it to be invited so I

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,800
can't read my blog blog write blog post

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,340
I can say hello let's say sorry I should

93
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,229
I should put it off on my screen on this

94
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,000
it's a bit hard

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,760
hello for them right and they can save

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,820
it I can publish it publish now publish

97
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,520
now so yeah so technically I mean so I

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,860
have a blog it's it's available

99
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,200
I hope my first blog post so idea is

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,139
this I mean to allow like normal users

101
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,610
without as you see it's pretty simple

102
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,380
actually the best would be without any

103
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,310
configuration but there's a bit

104
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,550
configuration it can be automated so but

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,479
but yeah so this is my blog so let's go

106
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,789
back to the puffin so I can see as you

107
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,560
see it's very very simple but I have my

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,150
application so this is my ghost that is

109
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,620
currently running I can run some more

110
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,530
applications what else I wanted to show

111
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,700
you here actually this is also

112
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,240
interesting

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,430
you can add a new application I mean

114
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,020
currently it works this is not user

115
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,740
friendly this is a github pool still so

116
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,270
yeah but needs to be improved

117
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,120
of course so it should be easy to add

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,880
your own applications there's some

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,289
there's some trick to it but I mean I

120
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:53,900
will show you later so this is this is a

121
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,870
demo thank you so so we can go back to

122
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,419
the presentation so I will tell you

123
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,340
maybe a bit what you just saw how it

124
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,030
works right

125
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,260
what is it so what is it so so what is

126
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,750
puffing so I think there are three we

127
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
can say there are three parts to toughen

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,520
there is the there is the platform that

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
actually it's responsible for for

130
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,840
running those for managing the

131
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,580
containers managing the applications

132
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,630
remembering good for applications

133
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,030
running

134
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,210
setting up some basic stuff because I

135
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,830
actually actually if I showed you

136
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,420
actually email for example if I register

137
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,310
my user the email remaining work so I

138
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,460
receive an email there are some basic

139
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,960
services that provides but actually the

140
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,850
platform is actually nothing more than

141
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,650
then there's the docker compose it just

142
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,000
caused oaken compose at some point

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,670
because applications are actually are

144
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,830
actually directory so the next part of

145
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,330
the of puffiness cutter is application

146
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,360
catalog its curated so the idea is to is

147
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,050
to keep it interesting I mean only they

148
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,060
curated in a sense I mean wow yeah

149
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,320
anyone can go through it actually it's

150
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,610
it's not that it's actually not

151
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,700
completely true but the idea is in each

152
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,590
application I just captured how to

153
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,270
install it so basically if I want an a

154
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,480
so a blog or or a forum software I go to

155
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
a website and I read the instruction

156
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,330
come to me so I need a MySQL I need this

157
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,669
and with this I capture it in a docker

158
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,430
compose file so this is the second part

159
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,410
so I'm actually all of them are

160
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,390
independent so plot from how to render

161
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,510
those containers those applications the

162
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,830
applications themselves the catalog

163
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,540
actually you can disconnect them you can

164
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,070
you can use just docker compose pretty

165
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,430
much without using puffin and the first

166
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,560
part is the is the hosting platform so

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,660
you can actually go to puffin rocks and

168
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,979
install your and run it alright so the

169
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,610
idea I will show you later but yeah so

170
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,919
this is the centralized service actually

171
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,300
this is the centralized part of the

172
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,000
decentralized inter right but actually

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
anyone can run their own platform which

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
is very easy but there's also hosted

175
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,050
platform for users who who don't want to

176
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,510
bother installing anything and studying

177
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:05,240
a managing the server or yeah so those

178
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,190
are the three parts I want to talk about

179
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,130
so now maybe I did how it works so

180
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,970
quickly it's by written in Python as

181
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,430
using docker of course is using the

182
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,229
composer I will show you how the how the

183
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,360
application looks like it's been pretty

184
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,650
much docker compose is the most

185
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,300
important one there's a reverse proxy

186
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,340
because I have a bunch of containers

187
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,200
running on the server so so the request

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
needs to be routed to them somehow so

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,490
there's a current ease and jinx again it

190
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,440
so it's containerized you can even if I

191
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,789
can use anything I have probably

192
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,789
switched to H Pro

193
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,760
a proxy and there's yeah there is for

194
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,070
example a male prostitutes relay so if

195
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,360
this is actually I was a container that

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,000
forward store will in a server this time

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
my answer because I don't want to be

198
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,390
sending server emails from my own server

199
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,620
because I will be probably blocked I

200
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,920
need to be careful about this so I

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,780
wanted to show you another quick

202
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,220
maybe not the demo but I have the

203
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,760
application looks like it's a bit cat oh

204
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:06,180
yes okay let's do it this way so so this

205
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,530
is my catalog write-ups so I can show

206
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,270
you I can show you a rocket chat for

207
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,740
example so all I have here is docker

208
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,040
compose readme and some pictures so

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,010
docker compose docker compose I will

210
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,840
just quickly off it's too big sorry I

211
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,350
was I was trying on a smaller screen

212
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,640
what okay this was the reason is this

213
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,730
yes what you see here is it's actually

214
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,010
dr. compost via version 2 there are two

215
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,300
services main and at dB what is

216
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,800
interesting here I mean what is

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,660
different from from standard compose I

218
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,130
need to have some environment variables

219
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,910
virtual hosts and and virtual port to to

220
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,000
tell the the proxy how to access the

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
application then I this is a standard

222
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,300
application setup actually this

223
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,290
applications pretty good because it

224
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,790
allows me to configure itself by

225
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,800
environment variables if it's not

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,720
available I can generate a config file

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
at startup for example from the

228
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,610
environment rate and I set up root URL

229
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,140
so technically I can run that compose

230
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,450
this and it will run my my ghost my my

231
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,240
rocket charts another funny thing here

232
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,130
is that I have three networks because

233
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,530
idea has its own network to be to be

234
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,090
separate from the others and I have

235
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,440
access to the front so the to the

236
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,820
to the proxy and back to the email and

237
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,710
other services provided by the platform

238
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,450
eventually so yeah some other services

239
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,190
in there it's kind of a private private

240
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,610
cloud and of course I store data in

241
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,920
volumes I don't want to lose my data so

242
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
this is and this is the second container

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,070
database yeah pretty much standard and

244
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,470
this is the only intact oh

245
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,350
okay yes so the other part is that is

246
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,060
the readme file is it's it's a markdown

247
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,550
it's nothing else than America so are

248
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,100
you sure okay yes you're right because

249
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,680
okay now okay the most funny part okay

250
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,810
white rocks well it's actually doesn't

251
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,850
Rock it's dot row it's just the rocks

252
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,940
it doesn't track yet but I hope to make

253
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,730
it make it rock yes because it's a

254
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,680
centralized you can run it you can run

255
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,040
your own it's simple for a user from

256
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,460
developer so user can you see one click

257
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,990
install and for developers easy to add

258
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,840
the app is it Ritchie friendly three

259
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,060
asset freedom and history also a beer at

260
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,500
the moment but actually you can run

261
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,360
thousands of containers on a simple

262
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,530
server that cost fifteen euros a month

263
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,170
so I think you can pretty much keep it

264
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,570
free for example run a platform for your

265
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,600
friends it's I haven't seen any problems

266
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,830
I have only one server now and pay

267
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,830
fifteen euros for it ok a bit about

268
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,020
future changes it's still an alpha I

269
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,190
really data yes

270
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,250
my alarm it's it's more like an egg than

271
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,170
the napa Fein right now security is a

272
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,440
big issue here it's it's multi-tenancy

273
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,270
so I have several containers running

274
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,380
from different people on the same

275
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,230
machine this is still unsolved problem

276
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,520
you can still escape a container but I

277
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,430
hope it will change I'm pretty sure that

278
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,600
you'll be able to run containers

279
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,120
somewhere in the cloud or on your

280
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,940
servers and they do we separate it and I

281
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,830
don't know I'm hopeful it will be like

282
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,420
VMs at some point I know they are not

283
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,270
the ends yeah and couple other things to

284
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,930
do so yes if you want to contribute

285
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,820
first you can try it - rocks just

286
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,010
install dokin compose up is very easy to

287
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,020
start up and then there are a couple of

288
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,410
links

289
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,900
if you

290
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,630
interested so sorry just one thing I

291
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,730
want to leave you with is that yeah the

292
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,200
idea here is really to make it a

293
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,510
distribution simpler so give give free

294
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,930
software to the users much easier than

295
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,310
it doesn't have to be complicated it has

296
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,470
me as simple as software-as-a-service as

297
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,360
Facebook so I can install the S power

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,350
like this or our blog or forum okay

299
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,640
thank you no time for questions
