1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,260
okay thank you for

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,370
ending this presentation so my angel

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,230
myself read and I want to talk to you

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,629
about fascinating convergence of

5
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:14,090
technologies we have reached a point now

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,970
where on the one hand we have basically

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,669
infinite computational power everyone

8
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:22,340
has a very fast and pure on his desk and

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,840
on the other hand we've got this

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,029
proliferation of small unmanned aerial

11
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,380
vehicles fitted with high quality

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,920
cameras and I want to talk you through

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,989
the generation of digital elevation

14
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,940
models geo-reference digital elevation

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,170
models using such kinds of UAV so I want

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,519
to show you a bit what software can be

17
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,710
used what are the flight requirements

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,140
and here's an example of two

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,000
measurements that were done so to give

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,290
you an idea of the area that I'll be

21
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,510
interested in that's about 40 meter

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,670
scale so we're talking about areas of

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,699
like a few hundred meters side pixel

24
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,080
resolution sub decimeter

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,309
and here's an example of braiding and

26
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,309
flow change of a small river between two

27
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,920
weeks where you can have aerial images

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,800
with short repetition time so I want to

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,520
get through this discussion about how to

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,010
generate such ultra photos and digital

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,930
elevation models using small unmanned

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,360
aerial vehicles that's actually a sequel

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,460
to the presentation I made at first 4G

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,860
French last summer

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,480
unfortunately tutorial I wrote at the

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,980
time was in French I had planned on

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,600
translating this for first then I

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,640
haven't got time yet to do so so if

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,470
anyone is interested in getting this

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,030
tutorial in English of course feel free

41
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,230
to send an email and I'll be happy to

42
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,600
translate it for you so why am i doing

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,720
this basically my basic input for your

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,260
morphological investigations or any kind

45
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,090
of geo-reference investigation that I'm

46
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,790
interested in is using elevation as a

47
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,670
basic input whoever I'm instruction

48
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,190
interested in measuring landslides a

49
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,840
glacier that's what I'm interested in

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,210
glacial melt material transport flooding

51
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,280
that kind of information now if you just

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
rely on global digital elevation models

53
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,409
such as SRTM or GDL you have what I

54
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,299
would consider low resolution from my

55
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:08,929
perspective

56
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,549
digital elevation models which are

57
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,770
typically three second arc over most of

58
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,110
the world one second arc over the US for

59
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,170
SRTM so we're talking about 30 90 meter

60
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,810
solution lateral resolution and

61
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,120
additional usually you have one digital

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,860
elevation model so if you want to make

63
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,260
difference of digital elevation models

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,819
you need to find some way of having

65
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,590
repeated digital elevation modes which

66
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,660
are usually not available so what I'm

67
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,850
interested to hear is how can i generate

68
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,819
local digital digital elevation models

69
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,100
which means what I mean by local is less

70
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,739
than ten square kilometer area what I'm

71
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,480
interested in is high-resolution sub

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,400
this meter pixel size and high update

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,550
update rate let's say 1 DM every week or

74
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,670
every month so that I can make

75
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,780
subtraction of zero elevation model and

76
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,700
see material movement or or changes of

77
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,150
the elevation of my area additionally

78
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,489
since I'm splits all started as a hobby

79
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,680
and as usual hobby gets more and more

80
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,350
into the work I'm interested in low low

81
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,150
cost equipment what I can mean low cost

82
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,890
I started this with a less than hundred

83
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,989
euro one of these toys that you can buy

84
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,780
a Christmas and slowly I'm getting into

85
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,280
more involved equipment now I'm doing

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,130
this with DJI drones but I'm I'm talking

87
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,549
about sub kilo euro equipment so the

88
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:26,780
challenge with that will be de tolly

89
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,730
telling to you about is that we will

90
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,950
have to handle a huge amount of images

91
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,370
typically we're going to acquire 600,000

92
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,459
images per flight so huge that might not

93
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,850
make sense to you but 600 to 1000 images

94
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,340
at high resolution images of typically

95
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,799
5/6 megabyte per image we're talking

96
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,190
about 6 7 gigabytes worth of images to

97
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,700
process the generator DM we're talking

98
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,950
about 10 square kilometer we've set this

99
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,840
meter resolution we're going to have

100
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,310
Giga gigabyte sized

101
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,170
orthophotos so I find this a bit

102
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,049
challenging to handle now this means

103
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,600
that hardly will be able to handle a

104
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,880
graphical user interface because such

105
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,720
data set would be

106
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,569
horrendously slow to render so I will be

107
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,820
presenting to you a tool a command line

108
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,350
interface that's been developed by a

109
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,060
French National Geographic Institute

110
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,160
evn which I'm not totally unrelated to

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,100
but I got I fell in love with a software

112
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,260
that we developed Macchio disini is in

113
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,720
charge of its development in one of the

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,260
labs off of en

115
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,670
and I want to introduce you this

116
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,620
software because at first it might be a

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,870
bit you might get a bit afraid when you

118
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,610
have a look at it Midmark and i want to

119
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,130
show you step by step how powerful the

120
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,110
approach relevant to the unique

121
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,420
philosophy of one tool for one solution

122
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,420
and not a fully integrated to will allow

123
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,460
you to on the one hand handle these huge

124
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,860
data set and on the other hand know

125
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,380
exactly what you're doing for each step

126
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,180
we have one tool for each step which

127
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,580
means we had an output which tells us if

128
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,130
this step was successful if it failed

129
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,960
then we have to find a reason but there

130
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,670
is no point in continuing the processing

131
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,130
if one step of processing failed this

132
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,110
will be get clear I think next in the

133
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,820
next slide but before we start

134
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,680
processing images we need to acquire

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,200
images so just let me emphasize how

136
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,150
compliance with regulation is important

137
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,010
if you're just doing this for fun you

138
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,240
might or might not comply with

139
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,010
regulations when it gets into your job

140
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,140
you must comply with regulations in my

141
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,020
case I'm flying in North know of no way

142
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,070
I need to get of course flight allowance

143
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,230
or exam I need to get flight

144
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,910
organisation from civilian Authority

145
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,940
this is a 30 page document that you have

146
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,410
to fill you have to check with the

147
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,060
difference ministry if they agree that

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,010
you take pictures this is Demilitarized

149
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,020
Zone that where I'm flying so difference

150
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,700
ministry doesn't care you have to check

151
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,380
that you're not harassing wildlife so

152
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,540
this kind of activity you have to check

153
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,940
to get it relation to fly once you get

154
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,710
all the authorizations you have to plan

155
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,370
your flight

156
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,040
so flight planning for making the

157
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,990
validation mode requires that you have

158
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,880
enough surface coverage from one picture

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,620
to the other so basically you make must

160
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,230
make sure that your pictures overlap by

161
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,810
at least 60 percent typically Micmac

162
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,400
says you should have eighty percent

163
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,010
overlap so once you have decided what is

164
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,900
your horizontal velocity in my case

165
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,760
typically 10 meter per second and you

166
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,490
know your altitude over the area then

167
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,260
you can calculate how often you have to

168
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,240
take an image in my case for example I'm

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
flying with a coverage of 100 meter I'm

170
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,220
finding a 10 meter per second I need to

171
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,200
acquire one pictures about every 2

172
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,030
seconds so this is why a 20-minute

173
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,820
flight will generate 600 to 900 images

174
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,020
now

175
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,940
once you've acquired your images you can

176
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
do this manually this is what I

177
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,020
originally did because I wanted to track

178
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,590
some features I want to do track some

179
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,690
ever or we can automate the flight but

180
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,290
in all cases you have the angular

181
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,120
coverage of your camera you know the

182
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,490
altitude so you can by knowing the

183
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,560
resolution of your camera you can

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,180
compute the pixel size and you see that

185
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,610
the UAV flying at 100 meter high with a

186
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,390
4000 pixel resolution will typically

187
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,810
create a DM with pixel size 4 centimeter

188
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,550
I'm not saying that what DM will have 4

189
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,170
centimeter resolution but at least your

190
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,850
picture your pixel size would be 4

191
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,250
centimeter and of course now we have

192
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,530
automated software this is a TG on one

193
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,630
of a free software that you can use for

194
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,960
to define the flight so you just have to

195
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,270
define the 2 corners of your flight

196
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,150
takeoff the drone get a coffee and come

197
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,850
back 20 meters later to land the drone

198
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,650
in this case it's landing automatically

199
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,630
you have to bring it back manually so

200
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,370
we've collected all these images each

201
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,680
one of these dot is an image how do we

202
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,950
process this image to create a DM first

203
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,340
thing either you're using a DVI or

204
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,350
geo-reference camera and it's easy you

205
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,050
have a exit tag and you've got the GPS

206
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,480
position in your image alternatively

207
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,710
you're putting a high quality camera

208
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,200
which does not have GPS you've got on

209
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,480
the other hand a GPS recorder what you

210
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,650
what I'm doing is I'm using a Jif to

211
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,330
command line interface exist tool

212
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,360
software for tagging my images so I can

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,250
say okay if you check the header of your

214
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,390
image

215
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,730
you know what the image is when you take

216
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,400
a clock in this case this is a GPS

217
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,070
discipline clock at Observatory close to

218
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,310
our place and this gives me I have the

219
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,070
header of image I have the GPS time I

220
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,410
can compute the difference between my

221
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,960
camera time and my GPS time and then

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,180
exit tool gives you the option - geo

223
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,090
sync and you can give it a whole enemy

224
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,220
are locked for enemy a locked file a

225
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,679
directory where your images are and

226
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,929
Egypt will take care of geo tagging all

227
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,080
your images so once we've got this set

228
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,750
of geo tagged images I will need to

229
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,390
inform my processing software we'll see

230
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,150
why the next step where each picture was

231
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,520
taken so this must be done in the

232
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,100
projector for projected referential in

233
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,070
my case I'm

234
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,350
lying orphan no way no way is UTM 43

235
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,230
north so I will convert all my positions

236
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,510
my WGS 94 84 NMEA log into a projected

237
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,300
framework and I will create a file at an

238
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,910
ASCII file in which I have longitude

239
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,120
latitude altitude and file name you will

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,330
notice that I remove a big offset

241
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,260
northern Norway is something like a

242
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,610
million meter sorry a hundred thousand

243
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,380
million North so I remove all this

244
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,720
offset here otherwise you have rounding

245
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,190
error under processing so you just keep

246
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,260
the relevant decimals of your position

247
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,680
and filename and you convert this text

248
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,060
file from a text file into XML and

249
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,140
Micmac is always prefix with mm3d so all

250
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,540
comments are mm3d and I want to convert

251
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,450
the orientation from a text file which

252
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,120
is here to an XML file and we will see

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,650
that we need to select a subset of

254
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,630
images for calibrating the lens

255
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,580
properties so we say we're going to use

256
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,130
as a reference image this particular

257
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,080
image which meets some of requirements

258
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,670
namely that there is a maximum elevation

259
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,220
variation in this image and I want to

260
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,720
take 25 images to calibrate the lens so

261
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,100
this is pretty much what you you will

262
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,930
always do you will always have mm 3d

263
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,700
watch what squad command you want to use

264
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,280
and the options to create whatever steps

265
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,500
you want so the first thing I want to do

266
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,660
is why do I need to use the GPS position

267
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,150
of each camera the first thing that a

268
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,800
software processing software will need

269
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,140
is type points meaning points that are

270
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,900
matching on above images so that the

271
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,720
software can say ok this same image was

272
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,060
the same point was taken from different

273
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,920
points of view now if you just do this

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,680
stupidly on a 600 picture data set and

275
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,150
you just say I want to correlate all

276
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,090
possible pairs then you'll find out that

277
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,830
you need like 200 thousand matching

278
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,630
steps and each one of these matching

279
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,250
step is tracing something like a second

280
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,230
so you're going to spend a few days just

281
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,780
finding the type points but you have a

282
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,250
good very strong assumption you know

283
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,380
that this image will most probably not

284
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,390
have any red a similar point with this

285
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,550
one because we are so far away so what

286
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,650
we can tell here is you tell Mi'kmaq ok

287
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,960
just consider images that are adjacent

288
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,270
in their GPS position so this is why we

289
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,630
compute

290
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,670
this file previously so we're going to

291
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,470
ask Nick Mack to use a Tapioca tool

292
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,110
using the file the file that we just

293
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,200
generated previously I export the text

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,850
file so that I can draw these images in

295
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,240
in QGIS and I asked it to only use those

296
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,910
pairs of closest images so by doing this

297
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,200
instead of having two hundred thousand

298
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,580
points you only have ten thousand pairs

299
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,460
to analyze much much faster and here I

300
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,830
drew pairs that Micmac has identified it

301
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,720
makes sense so the algorithm is working

302
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,420
pretty well and by doing this Micmac is

303
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,910
going to search for in pip points that

304
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,070
are matching in both pairs so here are

305
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,320
two adjacent images and if you follow

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,620
the arrows on the on your right you see

307
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,190
that the vector of motion of between the

308
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,350
two images is indeed properly computers

309
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,690
so Mi'kmaq has selected relevant points

310
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,910
on this image and computed where these

311
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,400
various points have moved from one image

312
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
to the other this will be the basic

313
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,670
input that we will need so here you see

314
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,550
first step verify that indeed the tied

315
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,110
point identification has worked properly

316
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,360
if you have very smooth areas or

317
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,300
features that are similar in multiple

318
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,690
pictures

319
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,850
this step will not work properly you can

320
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,050
draw the arrows and you can check that

321
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,930
these wizards working properly now we've

322
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,510
got the tied points next step we need to

323
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,700
model the lens we have a UAV I bought a

324
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,960
cheap toy

325
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,060
I have no characteristics of my lenses

326
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,520
so the system can automatically generate

327
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,030
a model of your lens I don't have nice

328
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,860
illustration so what I use is with a

329
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,870
slide to show you how you can help

330
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,880
yourself with Micmac when you don't know

331
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,040
how to do things the tool for matching

332
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,830
for finding lens properties is tapas so

333
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,870
we asked Micmac to run the tapas - and

334
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,670
we will help we have the list of all

335
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,520
possible lens models of course the more

336
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,950
complex the model is the better the

337
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,830
modeling of a lens properties but the

338
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,210
more difficult it is to make it to

339
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,540
converge so it's a trade-off between

340
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,740
complex models where you have a lot of

341
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
freedom but chances of not converging

342
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,980
and basic models with fewer models are

343
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,580
poor models but easier convergence I

344
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,030
just show you the output of tapas here

345
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,310
so that you can realize that all these

346
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,139
numbers here are errors in pixel in the

347
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,540
very beginning when you start the model

348
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,489
the length model is very poor so you see

349
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,649
I have errors of three peaks l 11 pixel

350
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,869
that's very bad if your model is

351
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,730
converging properly you will end up with

352
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,339
less than 1 pixel error between your

353
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,559
images so at first it might be

354
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,939
frightening to see these big numbers

355
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,499
coming out of MIT Mac but actually

356
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,299
they're very relevant they tell you the

357
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,100
percentage of tie points that will be

358
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,169
used and your pixel error so basically

359
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,970
if your picture is not converging

360
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,149
towards sub want value well you're in

361
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,129
trouble and something went wrong so at

362
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,629
the end you see that your worse

363
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,519
resolution is 1 pixel and residual is

364
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,429
about 0.9 pixel the lens was property

365
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:04,319
model properly modeled this is working

366
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:07,709
fine so once you've modeled your lens

367
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,399
you create a coarse cloud so this

368
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,040
basically to check if Micmac was able to

369
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,749
position properly the path of a UAV over

370
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,629
the surface and if your surface makes

371
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,699
sense with respect to what you expect

372
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,459
from your GM just be careful I was

373
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,319
recently introduced to this paper which

374
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,480
shows that self talkative self

375
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,489
calibration of the lens Matt creates

376
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,379
very low-frequency large-scale

377
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,899
distortions parabolic distortions which

378
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,779
I have seen so this is a caveat about

379
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,269
self calibration of the lens you will

380
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:44,730
create a large-scale distortions or you

381
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,829
might and if you look closely you see

382
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,069
here steel tracks while on the Sun here

383
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,879
that helped the software match the

384
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,720
features on this snow coated area once

385
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,459
you've done the course point cloud this

386
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,290
is the most time-consuming part you

387
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,829
create a fine point cloud you create the

388
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,129
ortho photo and you create a correlation

389
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:09,629
map that tells you where you're most

390
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,860
confident that your digital elevation

391
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,649
model is correct so what does the fine

392
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,509
point cloud look like well here is an

393
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,039
example of a fine point cloud of

394
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,259
generator this way so this is the

395
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,999
example of your fine point cloud you see

396
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,939
it's about 10 million points and you can

397
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,559
move around in your fine point cloud

398
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,239
that you've generated this way and

399
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:30,799
zooming to the area works the other way

400
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,919
and you can check the topography of your

401
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,200
digital elevation mode if I can zoom in

402
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,270
yeah so you see that indeed you have a

403
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,910
topography and as you haven't realized

404
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,560
you've got the hills and the valleys

405
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,860
that you can check so here I collected

406
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,560
these images I have one satellite image

407
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,450
of the region I'm interested in you

408
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,370
remember that we removed an offset in my

409
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,810
geo reference images

410
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,360
I put the offset back I insert this in

411
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,150
my world file so that my dataset is your

412
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,670
reference I correct for altitude I get

413
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,130
an image in pixels I have I get in an

414
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,370
XML file resolution so one pixel is 22

415
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,160
centimeters and if I overlap my DM you

416
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,740
see that I have braiding of rivers you

417
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,080
have fine continuity if you look at the

418
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,030
heal over here you indeed have something

419
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,250
that is relevant with aerial pictures so

420
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,650
the topography is matching the features

421
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,420
that we see on the ground so that's an

422
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,050
example of fusion of qg in qgis of your

423
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,310
digital elevation model with a

424
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,400
background satellite image you cannot

425
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,020
see here but this is a former site image

426
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,960
with 2 meter resolution and I get a DM

427
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,110
Rob sorry and I get GM with sedessa

428
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,940
meter resolution so when you zoom in you

429
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,200
really see the difference between the

430
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,330
big pixel of a satellite image and fine

431
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,330
pixels of a G of a UAV so here is an

432
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,760
example of subtracting 2 DM this 2 DM

433
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,520
were acquired one week apart during this

434
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,400
time interval there was a big flood here

435
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,750
is a channel where the river is flowing

436
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,600
and if I take a subtraction I see this

437
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,520
deep here which is about 3 meter deep

438
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,010
and does this match reality well I

439
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,199
didn't make a practical field check but

440
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,199
this is a kind of Canyon where River has

441
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,359
carved this path in the moraine that I'm

442
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,550
interested in and indeed that's pretty

443
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,790
much 3 meter high so it matches what can

444
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,560
be expected from heavy flooding in this

445
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,890
brittle material of a moraine where

446
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,119
landslides has created this deceleration

447
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,090
model difference now closer to you you

448
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,130
might do the same thing this is

449
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,900
something that was done in the lab I

450
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,090
collected two diesel edition models of

451
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,340
the parking lots next to our laboratory

452
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,860
and here is an example of acquired

453
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,050
acquisition in the end of September

454
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,720
beginning of April I did the same when

455
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,240
returning in May and when you do this

456
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,710
kind of processing you get the

457
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,640
correlation Maps

458
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,320
the correlation map tells you that where

459
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,270
there is grass of course grass has very

460
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,310
little relevant features so that the

461
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,680
mi'kmaq is unable to create a DM but on

462
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,140
the parking lot and on the soil covered

463
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,210
area the correlation is very good and

464
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,250
when you do a digital elevation model

465
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,200
you have a parking lot you have a cars

466
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,720
over here which are parked if I do a DM

467
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,560
subtraction

468
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,050
I see which car have moved from the

469
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,150
parking lot from one time to the other

470
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,340
so basically this is working pretty well

471
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,140
so as a conclusion to this presentation

472
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,370
I wanted to show you that using aerial

473
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,660
images with at least sixty percent

474
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,360
overlap azimuthal pictures you can

475
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,640
create these utilization modes by first

476
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,010
identifying type points lens properties

477
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,540
which are automatically generated from

478
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,190
the images if you even if you have a toy

479
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,920
camera you will be able to generate more

480
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,080
or less good quality lens models and you

481
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,610
need to get the camera position if you

482
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,620
want to have a geo reference model if

483
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,760
you just want to have a qualitative

484
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,980
model without your referencing you don't

485
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,440
even need a GPS it will handle by itself

486
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,170
the variety positions of the cameras we

487
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,030
create a course point cloud to make sure

488
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,860
that the position of a camera was

489
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,140
properly modeled by Micmac and the

490
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,810
result is auto photo the digitalization

491
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,630
model and the correlation maps to make

492
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,390
sure that we can assess the quality of a

493
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,460
result if you want some of your examples

494
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,380
we distribute this through the web

495
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,390
server of QGIS so you can connect to

496
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,130
this website to have the open layer

497
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,840
version of these results for the

498
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,820
french-speaking audience a couple of

499
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,980
articles were written on Mi'kmaq because

500
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,230
again the excellent documentation is not

501
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,640
really introductory Micmac is a

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,830
fascinating documentation for

503
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,870
knowledgeable users but here what I was

504
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,640
trying to do is to take you by the hand

505
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,070
and help you step by step so this was

506
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,660
again written in French for French

507
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,970
audience if anyone in turn is interested

508
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,080
in open source software for

509
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,090
digitalization modeling which was done

510
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,590
for auto photo you can also do this for

511
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,960
oblique view modeling of objects I will

512
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
be very happy to translate this to

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,980
English if anyone wants a basic tutorial

514
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,500
and Micmac any of this I thank you for

515
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,860
your attention

516
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:15,549
if there's any question so the question

517
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,250
is vertical accuracy what I did is I

518
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,320
went on a flat area made multiple

519
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,730
measurements so multiple slides

520
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,799
separated by four or five minutes and

521
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,649
the standard deviation on the parking

522
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,100
lot was 11 centimeters so let's say this

523
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,860
meter resolution into Moraine here from

524
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,840
two measurements done from two days

525
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,690
apart I get about 60 centimeters so my

526
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,309
current interest is whether I could

527
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,750
measure snow cover Fitness 60 centimeter

528
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,940
is at the threshold of what can be

529
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,429
usable one of the main reason of this

530
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,389
poor resolution in northern Maryland and

531
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,279
what I do in the parking lot is the poor

532
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,409
alignment of the 2dm of the parking lots

533
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,559
even if you misaligned by a few tens of

534
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,149
centimeter it doesn't matter if a very

535
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,429
rough moraine if you misaligned by even

536
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,399
a few centimeters then you have very

537
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,049
strong effect and this is really the

538
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,399
conclusion that I could not introduce

539
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,070
here but using ground control point

540
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,200
reference points is mandatory if you

541
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,990
want to have submitter resolution if you

542
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,049
just rely on GPS this is l1 GPS you will

543
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,179
not have enough resolution you need some

544
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,690
point to introduce GCP to max properly

545
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,779
and then I would expect 10 20 centimeter

546
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:44,769
vertical resolution so the question is

547
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,200
whether I select my altitude actually my

548
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,120
altitude is a trade-off between the

549
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,639
pixel resolution here you see that v

550
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,710
picks a fact centimeter is actually much

551
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,200
below what I expect the second one is

552
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,690
regulation I'm not allowed to fly higher

553
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,870
than 120 meters and to make it safe I

554
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,210
wanted to stay at 100 meter to tell you

555
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,580
the truth I sometimes went up 220

556
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,100
[Music]

557
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,500
it will it will see this in value

558
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,600
stipends it will be able so the sift

559
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,510
algorithm has scaling invariance

560
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,550
property so even if you change the

561
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,560
altitude the software will still be able

562
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,140
to find relevant Taipans and to compute

563
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,290
what was the altitude yes so then the

564
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,510
angle doesn't change angle is given by

565
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,420
the length properties this is a given

566
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,620
the length properties are fundamental

567
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,450
but what you will change is the area

568
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,310
that is covered here and this area will

569
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,870
be dependent on the height but the

570
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,490
length must not change this is a very

571
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,320
strong requirement this fixed lens

572
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,060
camera are perfect but if you have an

573
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,130
automated camera you must not change the

574
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,440
zooming or the lens properties to get

575
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,270
this to work if anything changes when

576
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,830
your calibration is wrong and everything

577
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,230
so the question is whether we can 3d

578
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,630
print this it's going to be too long now

579
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,850
transfer but the short answer is yes I

580
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,560
printed this on a 3d printer and it

581
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,690
works but you have to be careful to get

582
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,020
rid of all the outlying points so it's I

583
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,090
did it manually in Beamer and you have

584
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:30,530
to clean it in blender so the question

585
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,020
is at the effect of lightening this DM

586
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,450
were acquired over half a day I needed

587
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,560
five flight 20 minutes long each I never

588
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,930
correlate this flight with this one but

589
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,360
one flight is 20 minutes over 20 minutes

590
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,740
I have a few enough lighting condition

591
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,990
change but I have seen the failure so it

592
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,460
should affect but I have not seen this

593
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,450
on the short flights I'm using

594
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,040
so so I have flown here with winds up to

595
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,500
25 meters 25 kilometres per hour sorry

596
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,530
because the UAV can fly up to 10 meters

597
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,660
per second so above 2 to 3 meters per

598
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,120
second I would not advise flying now I'm

599
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,950
lucky enough to go on the field trip for

600
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,800
3 weeks at a time and I will wait for

601
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,900
the right conditions of course if you go

602
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,160
somewhere and you expect to fly

603
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
immediately change the fighters of the

604
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,090
day I flew with 25 kilo meter per hour

605
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,430
wind was we were going to a unique site

606
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,430
and I had to fly I had to try it but I

607
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:40,880
wouldn't advise it so my question is

608
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,980
about thermal imaging the problem is

609
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,540
that you need high-resolution features

610
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,330
too for a collation match i believe that

611
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,820
i GN EG and the french giraffe institute

612
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,410
has this kind of investigation I have

613
00:24:51,410 --> 00:25:06,680
not I'm sorry I tried so the question is

614
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,680
what / - what open-source - may I have

615
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,980
used I have tried at various sfm

616
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,840
software but I could find I cannot

617
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,300
remember all the features that I used

618
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,910
the solution is at the end of the day I

619
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,560
used the one that was so I have Python I

620
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,630
have some but I tried a few open-source

621
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,540
software and I was confident with that

622
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,820
with the French

623
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,900
sorry not French but geographic

624
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,610
institute was using this for production

625
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,970
I would be confident that it would be a

626
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,920
serious project not that the others are

627
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,360
not but I was confident in the

628
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,280
geographic institute and I got a very

629
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,380
good feedback from the group developing

630
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,650
this software in a TDM so there's no

631
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,690
rationale why I'm using this except that

632
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,220
I fell in love in it I fell in love is

633
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,220
the philosophy of a developer and if you

634
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,570
take a bit of time to go through the

635
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,150
initial difficulties of getting acquired

636
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,160
with it it's so powerful it's it meets

637
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,350
my requirement one tool for one step

638
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,530
checking each step so I could I have not

639
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,539
tried another the other software to come

640
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,889
on why this one of the others

641
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,399
