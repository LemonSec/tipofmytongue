[Music]

17
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,739
just make sure that the adaptation is

18
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,499
there so we want to have this kind of to

19
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,849
float an adaptation I mean we won't use

20
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,620
this kind of networks which is a bit

21
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,959
scary when you start thinking about it

22
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,059
and because I mean 96 packet is 28 and

23
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,620
just 127 bytes so that really also begs

24
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,389
down to having a real problem to see

25
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,889
headers that are normally in place if

26
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,290
you want to transmit over this over this

27
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,608
vial of Link's so yes

28
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,759
case calculation 127 bytes and then

29
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,439
frame header itself so if you go for an

30
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:36,039
extended address and to make sure that

31
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,229
we're going to strengthen captions are

32
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,400
shown as a syndication so you again bats

33
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,889
down so down to 81 and then 6 it'll give

34
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,740
what you said something like UDP and

35
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,409
then you have like say a few bites for

36
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,569
payload and let us out of that's where

37
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,150
the whole package I mean that's like a

38
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,939
25% you can get out of this one package

39
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:19,599
so that's really really bad and

40
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,699
specified c6 open adaptation layer to

41
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,680
make sure that going to reuse a lot of

42
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,300
the stuff that's already present and

43
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,909
layer 2 and you can use that in my RC

44
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,500
and whoever sits in that case and

45
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,990
network says it's happened a lot and

46
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,180
communication just six bytes compared to

47
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,830
Z for the advice you normally would have

48
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,800
this a 2006 and UDP and in that case

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,960
obviously security header but these six

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,710
parts is that what you condensed really

51
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,089
the IP version 6 stuff here

52
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,839
[Music]

53
00:06:40,660 --> 00:08:21,260
or two yet okay okay so the the project

54
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,340
itself means was in 2008 from people at

55
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,380
women stop these at the points are

56
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,360
called at the Zippy which is kind of

57
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,870
confused

58
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,789
for a lot of people in 2012 the mainland

59
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,770
default started for that so and by now

60
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,480
we are doing all the work directly into

61
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,340
the mainline kernel and the also remains

62
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,840
the project to make it a bit more clear

63
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,700
that we are not related to Victor here

64
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,100
it's a bit of problem because the Zippy

65
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,390
Alliance is certification that's

66
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,760
available you're not able to combine

67
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,140
that with the detail of the kernel

68
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,880
easily I mean you can do some some parts

69
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,260
of the kernel into the arrest and user

70
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,970
space you might be able to do that but

71
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,460
we are not having any idea on any plans

72
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,050
from supporting ZigBee so it so anybody

73
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,940
wants to do that they are free to do but

74
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,820
it's not our no agenda and yeah it is

75
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,280
normal in developer mode all you just

76
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,780
post Patra to main is just costing

77
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,390
serums and they're getting applied it's

78
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,430
a really small community so so there are

79
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,940
only like two core developers and I'm

80
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
one of them but I'm really only spending

81
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,530
like 10 or maybe 15% of my time on that

82
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,810
and the other ones still a student so

83
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,360
right now yes a lot of time - not right

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,640
now but yet a lot of time and maybe this

85
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
even is going to get a job how much time

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
are you left left for that then there's

87
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
a few more people that actually working

88
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,700
mostly on the driver space so to support

89
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,210
their own op there yes almost 100 people

90
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,650
remain this so there's quite some

91
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,260
interest and VF normally likes 30 people

92
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,110
around on IRC so there's interest in

93
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,820
using it but not that many people that

94
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,540
are actually working on it yes so the

95
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,740
support we have right now is we have a

96
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,930
Verity of drivers for the different

97
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,850
transceivers that are out there most of

98
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,100
them are soft neck drivers say that we

99
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,610
are doing the whole neck make software

100
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,590
stack in the in the kernel itself or not

101
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,030
on the hardware and they are neck

102
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,670
confuse as well we support one of them

103
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,200
or at once in the process of being

104
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,260
supported and we really need to do a lot

105
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,730
more work there to get more of these

106
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,580
devices into the Takano there for

107
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,800
support for

108
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,480
fragmentation and reassembly for fix

109
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,270
open that's in the autopsy that actually

110
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,250
started that and then we have support

111
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,830
for the IP header compression and the

112
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,480
next set of compression for UDP thought

113
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,340
that have been the examples I've shown

114
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,650
before and that is in a new era of sea

115
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,520
from their own

116
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,800
and the same stuff is actually also used

117
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,170
by by beauties for the British subsystem

118
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,899
because there's also a 6lowpan of a

119
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,850
Bluetooth specification from the ITF and

120
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,649
there's a lot of other link layers that

121
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,110
are either already specified or in the

122
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,690
process of using 6lowpan on top of the

123
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,330
link layer so they've gotten going for

124
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,680
deck tests or work on going for MSTP and

125
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,420
some power line communication things and

126
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,300
so on so that's really a lot of things

127
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,610
but only looters and fifteen or four

128
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,899
other things that are supporting the

129
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,490
North Kona so that's the only things we

130
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,130
are doing there it's a portal in class

131
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,140
security which is working but how to use

132
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,600
from from the you know space perspective

133
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,230
because the there's note in the sex

134
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,390
there's no certification how you do

135
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,580
rollover off key is key handling and all

136
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,250
the other things so the basic plumbing

137
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,620
to get the keys into icy hot there or

138
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,060
just do it in the kernel on the kernel

139
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,040
side and encrypt the frames and decrypt

140
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,990
them but all the handling on top of that

141
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,910
is really not there so that's kind of

142
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,360
problematic yeah they're testing against

143
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,220
other links and stances and protecting

144
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,760
against riot and Kentucky it's an really

145
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,740
active project in terms that we are

146
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,140
changing things every kernel release if

147
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,810
you want to try it out really aim for a

148
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,100
new kernel I know that sometimes

149
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,920
difficult on on that reports say four

150
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,209
point one is something we can actually

151
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,020
list that this everything before might

152
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,010
be problematic

153
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,329
so yeah different kind of development

154
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,040
what we are working with right now there

155
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,279
are CCF 40 I mentioned that from Emily

156
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,899
Lake neutrality that's on the on the

157
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,899
right side down here the driver for that

158
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,820
is in the process of being merge is not

159
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,970
India yet the most commonly used

160
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,890
hardware platform it's a Raspberry Pi

161
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,050
together with an open lab here so that's

162
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,020
just these small black thing sitting on

163
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,910
top of that so let's see it's just it's

164
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,500
in fever transceiver to be a little bit

165
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,600
of extra hardware you need to so that

166
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,370
would be basically what you could add to

167
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,620
your own board what I do for example is

168
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,680
that I feel various Raspberry Pi sitting

169
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,029
on my desk and then I see different

170
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,620
transceivers just wired up to the

171
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,460
Raspberry Pi because you only need

172
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,670
yeah and some other cheaper Elsa but you

173
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,830
need so on your embedded hopper is

174
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,740
support for the right screen so if

175
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,110
you're running another free support for

176
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,450
your for your boards on some PSP or

177
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,220
something that's outside that might be a

178
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,589
problem but I hope by now that all the

179
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:15,270
embedded boards that are kind of

180
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,640
supported even by a van or BSP or

181
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,959
something have support for device stream

182
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,339
if you want to do all this USB that's

183
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,380
also possible I mean might not be the

184
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,120
thing you're aiming for but it's really

185
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
convenient if you want to do the

186
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
development on your laptop or even just

187
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,870
put it in a box that is completely Maine

188
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,670
powered and you want to don't want to

189
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,680
have to all the hassle and and adding a

190
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,620
and you bought to the system so that's

191
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,080
one USB stick over there there are some

192
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,020
more but that that one here is the best

193
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,290
we are supporting right now that's not

194
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,610
that's all you have all the stuff

195
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,529
already build the phone that's also open

196
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,029
source you can even go and hack around

197
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,980
on that one if you adjust it another one

198
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,779
of these devices so you can buy them

199
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,740
again because they haven't been

200
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,750
available for like three years

201
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:09,360
and run off like 120 devices and they

202
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,890
sold out at some point and nobody

203
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,500
immediate interests or the the capacity

204
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,750
of doing that I mean that the capacity

205
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,610
of doing your hopper one that's okay

206
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,339
about doing all the billing and selling

207
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,300
and all the other things it's really

208
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
complicated so finally I found a company

209
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,830
who gladly did that for us so they are

210
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,330
now sharing them again yeah happy side

211
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,390
so what you need on your and data board

212
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,160
if you want to add that it's really

213
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,740
simple so you need an SPI port and you

214
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,050
need maybe some additional GPIO pins

215
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,410
that's basically it it can go down to

216
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,990
just one expert if they open for for an

217
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,760
interrupt handler for example does that

218
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,650
make sure that you are now than there's

219
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,770
a packet coming in it could be more

220
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,630
depending really on the hardware and

221
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,190
what you want to do with that that's an

222
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,160
example on the next slide and then you

223
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,339
can share between completely ready-made

224
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,350
modules that are available you can just

225
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,970
hook that up or I can completely

226
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,800
integrate it in your own design if you

227
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,680
want to have

228
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,290
tightly on the PCB or whatever so then

229
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,850
we can mostly go with the reference from

230
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,740
the from the half a manufacture and then

231
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,140
go at all I mentioned that before you

232
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,810
can go with those bu speed maybe even

233
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,550
only for prototyping or something that

234
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,890
helps but in the end product that might

235
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:33,550
not be what you want to do yeah so I

236
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,010
mentioned that device few bindings so

237
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,930
all the drivers we have have device few

238
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,470
bindings the example over there I don't

239
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,260
know if you can read that so it's really

240
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,709
basic I mean since easel that's just a

241
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,720
comfortable matching over the other that

242
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,320
would be for an admiral transceiver yes

243
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,990
we the SPI speed the clock speed and

244
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,860
then us the port that for p0 and that

245
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,130
pointer and then you have on GPO

246
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,330
being for the drop handling and here you

247
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,950
have some more deeper also this

248
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,380
transceiver for example so you have some

249
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,770
pin to actually reset the hopper and one

250
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,990
for the for the sleep state I don't know

251
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,300
how much we are using that but that

252
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,650
really depends on the different can see

253
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,940
your hardware that available so as you

254
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,589
can see that can you can really easily

255
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,779
add that to your existing hardware

256
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:32,410
designs so the 20 versus support of the

257
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,080
driver P we have right now a lot for the

258
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,120
for the Admiral transceivers they are

259
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,130
phone for microchip as well we have

260
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,020
phone for analog devices we have four

261
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,500
140 I and the 80 USB type-c USB dongle

262
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,410
so that's it's actually an app nor

263
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,930
transceiver on on the thing but you

264
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,430
there's a different communication cost

265
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,990
goes over USB and the affirm their

266
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,990
support that the planning driver for the

267
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,180
cascada that's the ship that's on the CI

268
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,880
40 bots that's ongoing we are yeah

269
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,829
hopefully we are getting that in person

270
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,929
the next weeks or something then there

271
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,040
are see some XP devices which kind of

272
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,199
problematic to support because I mean on

273
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,089
the one hand one side there are hot mac

274
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,770
so they're doing a lot of stuff inside

275
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,510
the firmware of the of the ship itself

276
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,900
and one

277
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,270
way to communicate the same as over a

278
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,349
key commands which is really ugly I mean

279
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,939
from the US that's fine that's really

280
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,349
nice you can just happen to your

281
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,090
interface and with all user space you're

282
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,410
good for search but if you want to

283
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,210
integrate that inside the kernel of it's

284
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,130
a MEK layer there that's the tricky but

285
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,990
there's also versions which have some

286
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,690
kind of library API and that's a driver

287
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,470
out there

288
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,990
I never tested it I think it's bit water

289
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,990
fine now but it could be revived so if

290
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,240
if there would be interested interest in

291
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,690
that could be done I guess yeah so the

292
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,950
use piece thing I mentioned that's big

293
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,710
so just an overview I mean the slides

294
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,330
uploaded so you don't really have to go

295
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,710
through all of sets you can just

296
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,850
download them and have a look I just

297
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,530
want to give you guys an overview of

298
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,020
what kind of stuff we are supporting and

299
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,490
what kind of these transceivers are

300
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,130
supporting so this column here would be

301
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,040
if you have to do our for that so most

302
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,660
of them are covered I mean some of the

303
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,910
drivers obviously support more than one

304
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,800
transmitter a transceiver that would be

305
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,679
for the upload trips for example would

306
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,230
be the case and then you can see if it's

307
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,690
on the 2.4 gigahertz band or if it's on

308
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,059
the sake a husband but it's kind of

309
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,820
problematic because it's not easy easy

310
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,130
yeah usable everywhere so that you can

311
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,410
go with that if you want this a verb

312
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,150
that means automatic retransmissions

313
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,700
that hardware feature that's quite quite

314
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,150
useful because and the timing you have

315
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,970
to send out an AK that then would

316
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,860
trigger a retransmission or not because

317
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,750
it's missing it's really really tight

318
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,120
timing and we are not easily able to

319
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,070
handle that and software on the north

320
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,960
side I mean I haven't tried this

321
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,880
pre-emptive Petrus or something like

322
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,410
that so I really I could look into that

323
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,110
but how they normally have some extra

324
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,790
support for that so acceleration for

325
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,290
that one so you can really use that if

326
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,760
you don't have that that might be a bit

327
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,059
tricky for example the CC 25 20 from ti

328
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,770
is I don't have that they're just

329
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,110
completely fine on then you're running

330
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,420
that with some you time OS on some Mac

331
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,679
control or something like that because

332
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,300
it can just emulate that on the left

333
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,020
side that's a bit tricky and then on the

334
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,730
other hand you just the specs are

335
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,950
covering there's just what versions are

336
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,780
supporting and whatnot and

337
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,480
four times the 15.4 G over there on that

338
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,170
an extend extension of the original

339
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,330
specification that gives you a bigger

340
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,570
MTU actually so that our specification

341
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,790
better guard as well and we are not

342
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,400
really supporting that very right now so

343
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,110
that's mostly because you don't have to

344
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,310
hop there around to test it actually if

345
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,200
you just want to start a little bit and

346
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,340
get something started

347
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,500
maybe then why you do the software

348
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,000
support and see how the guys are just

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,860
ramping it up and getting it extended

350
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,660
you can already start with just a

351
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,180
virtual driver just really fake loopback

352
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,830
driver behalf they're really similar to

353
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,290
what the hardware simulation driver is

354
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,080
from from the wallet group it's really

355
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,940
great for testing you don't have to have

356
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,550
all the devices around and it can also

357
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,500
do some tricks with it like having your

358
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,170
wired or open sweat at some completely

359
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,540
additional stack running on top of this

360
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,670
virtual driver so that means that the

361
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,400
whole next stack from these different

362
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,860
operating systems can really run on the

363
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,310
new paper

364
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,380
drivers it's really nice for testing and

365
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,440
so on not really that not for for

366
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,080
production yeah so you can see you just

367
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,510
like the fake lb module there and then

368
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,760
you just at the non-black devices as

369
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,200
option on them you're normally done so

370
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,270
once you have these Hardware supported

371
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,040
or have they're added to your device you

372
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,390
really want to start you need to

373
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,310
configure it at some point and really

374
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,710
make sure that you can communicate with

375
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,770
other devices out there so what we have

376
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,040
there the counterpart of the kernel

377
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,420
support we have is the wpm tools so in

378
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,010
that the main binary where the iw tienen

379
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,630
tool that actually does all the

380
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,880
configurations that we also quite close

381
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
to the iwu user space utility from the

382
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,580
wireless group so that's not too far

383
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,220
away it's a net link code actually it's

384
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,380
also board from the outside so what you

385
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,650
do the ask you can configure the defi

386
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,390
options you have on that receiver and

387
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,970
you can configure whatever mech level

388
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,390
parameters are available the basic

389
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,710
things you have to do to get

390
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,690
anything working is to configure the pen

391
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,429
ID and see the channel

392
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,500
I mean Kennedy might you can even might

393
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,390
drop that but the channel is something

394
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,529
you need to make sure that they are

395
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:56,640
really can communicate too so 1504 does

396
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,409
no channel hopping or anything so really

397
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,299
set a fixed channel and you may need to

398
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,529
make sure that the other D writes on the

399
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,809
same channel so if you want to have like

400
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,360
a bit more romance frequency a frequent

401
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,919
Shanghai thing you need to make sure

402
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,120
that you have an upper layer that's

403
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,679
actually informs all the notes that

404
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,029
you're searching channel to stuff like

405
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,279
that so but that's nothing that in the

406
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,059
lower levels um yeah I can set a short

407
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,740
address you can Palace ethics and stuff

408
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,690
like that so frame retries is also I

409
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,659
mentioned that before how often you

410
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,750
would we try to send a frame to note and

411
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,200
if it's before you actually report an

412
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,390
error or something exams so yes so the

413
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,960
packages are packaged by some

414
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,909
distributions some are a little bit

415
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:43,350
behind and some don't have support for

416
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,390
that so if you're interested in helping

417
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,520
the SERP it would be cool if not

418
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
comparing it from source is really easy

419
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,809
so they are the only dependency we

420
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,390
really have seen that link library to

421
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,320
fall so once you have see the basic

422
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
stuff set it up you do need to do some

423
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
testing or you get to see if this device

424
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
actually can talk to each other and you

425
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,779
normally want to do that before you

426
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,350
start with the whole IP version 6 stack

427
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,840
on top of it so what you can do is we

428
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,960
have a small utility it just kind of a

429
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,750
ping utility on the 15 node 4 layer it's

430
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,820
not the full feature you would do now

431
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,580
from your normal ping utilities but it's

432
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,980
it's a good start actually so you need

433
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,429
to one so Damon on on one side because

434
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,340
that's not something we can inside the

435
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,200
corner on the the protocols not

436
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,360
specified or something so we need to

437
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,860
offer on the other side if a daemon

438
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,289
running but that that's nothing else

439
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,500
about getting all the frames and then

440
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,779
sending the same stuff back so the real

441
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,450
logic is inside the client here anyway

442
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,669
so you can just go and think the other

443
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:53,880
side have different different count or

444
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,350
the prices and stuff like that you can

445
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,820
really do some

446
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,309
measurements as well down so the device

447
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,490
bring up if everything is right with

448
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,830
your device reconfiguration and all the

449
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,620
other things are working fine the WPA

450
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,799
and interface shows up tightly after

451
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,370
booting and from there you can go and

452
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,250
see if you want to use 6lowpan on top of

453
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,220
that and configure it so if you go from

454
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,799
up to down here the settings of the

455
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,320
first envelope and vo would only be the

456
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,700
case if you configure two device before

457
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,009
normally what not for the fourth root of

458
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:35,100
it would not show up give any sort of

459
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,750
device down then you use the the iw and

460
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,820
utilities here to set the pen ID and

461
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,070
then you are setting the channel as well

462
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,460
as a professional 26 year to zero off

463
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,129
just a page at some point there have

464
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:52,019
been more frequencies available for this

465
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,419
specification and they started to paging

466
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,980
the different frequencies here so that

467
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:04,730
looks a bit absorb add something more

468
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,370
yeah and then this line here which is

469
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,990
actually the meet if you want to get

470
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,919
6lowpan

471
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,590
on top of these interface going so that

472
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,629
actually says that the type is sloped

473
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:17,730
and so and then you get a new interface

474
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,580
called opengl and this happen that means

475
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,429
if you are doing any succulent

476
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:28,500
interaction or communication over that

477
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,659
one it would play into the 15.4 layer

478
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,149
and if you do anything here that the

479
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:33,690
diode

480
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,600
IP version 6 communication so you really

481
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,289
use complete normal IP sockets for

482
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:45,659
version 6 and you're done for the

483
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,059
beginning or just to see what what other

484
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,799
devices are communicating and stuff like

485
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,840
that we also have support for monitoring

486
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,590
interface this permissions node in this

487
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,080
case you would just delete the

488
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,789
interfaces already there and bring it up

489
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:03,179
again as the monitor type continue at

490
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,129
the end and then you can set the channel

491
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,740
again and things monitored interface up

492
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,990
and then you can use Wireshark ECP drama

493
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,190
or whatever

494
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,860
on that one and as I said there's no

495
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,330
channel hopping involved so if you

496
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,310
really want to scan around but what kind

497
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,170
of communication is going on in the

498
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,850
place where are you are at the moment

499
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,730
and you can change the channel in the

500
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,590
background so that's what I normally do

501
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,540
we can just keep why I like running and

502
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,860
then you're on different consoles

503
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,840
changing channel and see if something

504
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,140
comes in there okay so communication

505
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,090
with other operating systems here and

506
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,670
you to speed up a bit here so that's

507
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,680
wired thyself

508
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,810
say that the friendly operating system

509
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,790
for intend of things there are LGPL

510
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,490
license there are actually quite

511
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,140
differently so all the people Vav on

512
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,240
both the SAMS really nice to the can

513
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,640
talk to each other we see bugs in the

514
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,140
implementations of the other testing it

515
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,460
out and so on that's oh that's quite

516
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
good going on there they also have

517
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,440
testing against unix w appear and in

518
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,930
their release process it's quite a nice

519
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,940
thing so make sure that actually keeps

520
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,640
working then they have Kentucky they

521
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,940
just love order and mmm kind of see the

522
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,670
parent of all kind of operating systems

523
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,950
that are now in the internal sync space

524
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,180
here

525
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,340
the problem is it's a really fragmented

526
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,340
project and there's a lot of folks out

527
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,860
there either commercial or academic or

528
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,170
stuff like that and it's really hard or

529
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,970
suddenly happening that they are merging

530
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,930
the stuff back

531
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,760
I mean North Alessa 3d is still an

532
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,350
important operating system they say we

533
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,060
are going on there so that's also

534
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,110
something we are we are testing against

535
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,040
so another famous

536
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,670
table here as you can see is that the

537
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,040
basic stuff that phones in all of us are

538
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,080
supporting like data and ik frames are

539
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,990
being communicated something that is not

540
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,260
supported on all of these systems is

541
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,660
beaten in Khmer command frames the scene

542
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,220
is why we don't support that

543
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,500
except for 6lowpan you don't need it at

544
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,750
all you need that if you want to do real

545
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,570
management often 15 that for network or

546
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,790
for stuff like sick piece of port or

547
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,380
something like that that's very neat

548
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,270
beaten sand Mecca man friends and stuff

549
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,210
like that the plan to support that but

550
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,370
there's really no what's no priority to

551
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,660
do that

552
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,670
little air security that's something we

553
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,230
support and Kentucky supports and we had

554
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,090
some initial testing between these two

555
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,670
as well right does not support that yet

556
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,070
that might change and at one point and

557
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,580
and again fragmentation and stuff like

558
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
that had a compression that's all

559
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,030
supported by AB all of them and yeah

560
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,530
that's ripple which is a routing

561
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,120
protocol for these kind of Lawson

562
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,610
networks

563
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,080
unlike on Kentucky that tightly into the

564
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,270
operating system on the links sides as

565
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,900
an user space Damon doing that that's

566
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,240
called unstrung so it's also a formal

567
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,860
implementation for that but these

568
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,380
cultures are really outdated I need to

569
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,660
go back talk to the also if you still

570
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,860
interested in getting that into the

571
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,390
cornea or not but that's a complete

572
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,230
different story the other operating

573
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,080
systems that support this kind of

574
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,290
protocols

575
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,400
there's embed from arm I try to look

576
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,020
into that but it's completely closed

577
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,630
I mean ambit OS itself it's open source

578
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,610
so most of it but the networking stack

579
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,380
at least the part I'm interested are

580
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,330
completely closed so they even have the

581
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,780
object five inside the gate repo so

582
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,850
there was really no nothing for me to

583
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,350
test against or check they just recently

584
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,240
switched to a complete they started to

585
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,770
see kentucky networking stack but

586
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,300
they're now completely dead a rewrite

587
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,880
there and they have actually really good

588
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,220
support for our kind of Beaton's

589
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,230
frames and maximin frames and stuff like

590
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,790
that so that's something I need to test

591
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,890
against some hardware at home that

592
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,510
actually should support that I just need

593
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,480
to find the time to do that and that's

594
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,450
all the sweat from from Netflix which is

595
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,040
an open source implementation of the

596
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,750
sweat protocol which is a complete

597
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,450
vertical stack using 1504 6lowpan

598
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,310
but a lot of other things on top of that

599
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,010
so that's something we for example

600
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,760
Jessica this virtual drivers we had and

601
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,250
we try to talk to them and find out if

602
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,290
there's any any chance that you can work

603
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,840
a bit together a bit more closely but

604
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,820
there's really not that much we have in

605
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,410
common I mean that's Santa from both

606
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,150
sides so there's no bad blood or

607
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,560
something but they really want to make

608
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,410
sure that their stuff is in one central

609
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,610
pieces they keep it running in one

610
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,630
yeah in one piece and that finding with

611
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,120
interface to to exercise Selvi need to

612
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,650
figure out ourselves on some ways for

613
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,450
that yeah but if we look at here the

614
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,160
missing part mentions that B connects

615
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,110
and support that something I need to

616
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,290
work on we need to have after we have

617
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,080
that we can create a support in the in

618
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,150
the user space utilities and even

619
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,590
scanning from that versus stuff like

620
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,550
that but really urgently need my

621
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,990
transceivers so that's something we

622
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,600
really need to improve on this in the

623
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,130
next few months or something because

624
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,320
that really blocks a bit of hardware

625
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,370
support that's annoying and then there

626
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,080
is other since different header

627
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,300
compression techniques are still then we

628
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,800
need to find out what kind of

629
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,630
informations we need to expose to all

630
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,240
kind of routing or machine protocols

631
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,340
that are using that I mean simple things

632
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,610
like

633
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,850
AQI or alazai are something except that

634
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,620
is one thing but also like statistics

635
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,260
how many packets have been transmitted

636
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,000
over this link or how many retransmit

637
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
has been saved and stuff like that so

638
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,790
that's something we need to expose

639
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,830
somehow but if you are going to do to

640
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,450
your face you really need to be think

641
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,890
carefully about that because we need to

642
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,980
support it until the hair freezes over

643
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,570
on the north side so that's something

644
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,140
really need to make sure forum before

645
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,980
yeah up here running the 54 wireless

646
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,440
network on top of Linux is really easy

647
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,060
even right now I mean there are missing

648
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,950
pieces and stuff like that but just for

649
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,530
getting the IP version 6 socket

650
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,090
interface on top of these things and

651
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,320
then communicate with some smaller

652
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,180
sensor device and stuff like that that's

653
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,970
already there that's all working yeah

654
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,750
come on

655
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,910
tooting supports they're the most likely

656
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,790
scenario it is used in right now's like

657
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,740
a gateway or Borobudur

658
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,350
you could go and have set as your your

659
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,990
small note even in that I mean I know

660
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,780
that intro has been able to completely

661
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,660
squeeze Luscombe and Bluetooth you

662
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,370
displace utilities and everything in

663
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,480
within 1 megabyte so that's something if

664
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,760
you want to try it on to set so that

665
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,870
might be something you can even

666
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,770
one battery for a longer time yeah that

667
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,200
would be from my side so I'm for

668
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:09,820
questions now so the address is actually

669
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,760
coming from delay to address of the

670
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,890
Harper so they're like the automatic

671
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,500
address generation IP version 6 you

672
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,750
could use DHCP on top of that if you

673
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,400
want I mean that's really really up to

674
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,170
you you have to normal IP version 6 link

675
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,570
but the general a to address you get in

676
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,280
the beginning that's actually coming

677
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,080
from the MAC address being

678
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,390
auto-generated coming up there so but on

679
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,830
top of that you can use their TT here

680
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:52,060
yeah yes yeah we actually haven't really

681
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,680
thought about that that much and now

682
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,810
that at least one or two should see us

683
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,880
at support I know that that at least one

684
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,710
or two transceivers that actually

685
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,370
subtract motivate an IDs there are we on

686
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,860
the coalified at the end really looked

687
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,930
into that so that's something we you

688
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,820
might have that actually I don't know

689
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,040
what now this would work or not but I

690
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,840
would suspect not at the moment so that

691
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,969
really you need to test it out and find

692
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,639
out what its locking and what not so

693
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,080
another game sort of just something that

694
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,860
we need to look into

695
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,889
definitely threat there are different

696
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,030
receivers that are not 15 year old self

697
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,219
that you can select on the metal bed the

698
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,170
problem is just something like the

699
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,139
hopper serrated features like the deck

700
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,000
sending our tech notes and friends and

701
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,190
stuff like that that is something and we

702
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,670
rely on the transceiver out there on so

703
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,620
if you ignore these parts you might can

704
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,380
do that I know that for example on

705
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,390
arrival from Andy I'm not sure they also

706
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,240
have support for some GI devices that

707
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,430
are not 15:04 compliant itself but in

708
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,060
blastin RF transmitters and they 115 or

709
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,120
for over on the next IP never did that

710
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,620
the coffee really rely on some of the

711
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,170
other feature you could try the doubt I

712
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,910
mean in the end for us it just means to

713
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,530
having a transceiver driver half a

714
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,330
driver that's things with stuff in so

715
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,319
you can drive it out if you want

716
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,670
[Music]

717
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,270
something like Kentucky Kentucky on it I

718
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,750
mean that different now that but so

719
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,610
that's something we test again there are

720
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,890
other things for the sudden sweat for

721
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,210
example that the same stuff that

722
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,070
something be tested a little bit against

723
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,420
I mean we can test against a whole

724
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,850
switch back because it's a lot more just

725
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,270
about things to get frames and other so

726
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,700
that's what we did we don't really have

727
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,500
tested against all kind of hardware so

728
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,940
things running out of time okay

729
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:26,389
[Applause]
