1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,180
okay good morning everyone

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,639
this is not going to be a very technical

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,869
speech don't be worried I'm not going to

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:18,880
talk about how to tweak the user

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,640
interface other people are going to tell

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,400
it before better but you may have seen

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,429
the announcement that we have done about

8
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,880
the user interface concept and I wanted

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,520
to as this has been extremely successful

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,980
in terms of positioning I wanted to give

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,660
a little background on this and

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,530
especially as a thank to the developers

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,329
and the designers that have provided the

14
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,760
solution because of course when you

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,379
speak about software if you don't have

16
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,050
the product you cannot do any

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,670
announcement so from my side being the

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,950
person that is after marketing of

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,500
LibreOffice a big THANK to all the

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,590
developers and the designer and heiko is

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,220
is back on on the corner but I think his

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,979
has been one of the key people we have

23
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,790
had quite strong discussions but I think

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,820
that at the end the result was extremely

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,329
positive so we we it's very I'm going

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,670
very quickly through the slides we have

27
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,009
a very complex user scenario at the

28
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,229
moment we have we go from people that is

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:43,840
using laptops to CRTs on on all screens

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,740
to white screens to mobile screens and

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,810
the the user interface has to answer

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,469
everything and we have different

33
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,689
generation I think that they're all in

34
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,880
this room I'm probably the only one here

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,289
but the all the others are in the other

36
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,139
generation and if we look at how many

37
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,560
PCs have people in different generation

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,500
you think you see that even people that

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,780
is over their 70s starts to have an

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,730
and in an interesting number so it's

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,810
more than 25% and of course they have

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,060
site problem that make the user

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,700
interface are very important and you

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,310
have to answer in a flexible way their

45
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,770
needs and if you look at screen sizes

46
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,370
this is amazing these are the top I

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,000
think 20 screen sizes and you see that

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,780
no one is having an advantage so the one

49
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,700
366 by 768 which is wide is nineteen

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,260
point one but then you see all the

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,820
others are very they have tiny tiny

52
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,620
percentages so that we cannot count on

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,220
on a single screen size and these are

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,750
computer skills by the OECD these have

55
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,270
to be interpreted because it tells that

56
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,050
for instance in Japan over 40 percent

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,320
can't use computers it the reality is

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
that the the language in this case says

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,180
they cannot control their computers when

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,000
they're using it so they depend from the

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,430
computer they do not they are not able

62
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,160
and so the user interface is extremely

63
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,230
important because if you are not able to

64
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,130
getting to manage your computer then you

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,440
depend from the user interface from what

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,890
you are able to do and these are skills

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,459
versus age and of course you can see

68
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,090
that skills go down but they they are

69
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,829
not down to nothing so it's it's it was

70
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,110
very important to have a user interface

71
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,090
that was flexible enough to to answer to

72
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,610
everything to all the needs so you know

73
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,799
that with 5.3 that we have announced a

74
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,880
few days ago we have introduced the the

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,239
notebook bar so now we have at least

76
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,380
three different options which is the

77
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,600
traditional user interface with a bar on

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,300
top and the side bar on the side we have

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,910
the this this is what people most people

80
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,460
have seen in the last few years using

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,639
brofist we have a more streamlined user

82
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,430
interface without the sidebar and with a

83
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,280
more sizable toolbar on top and and now

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,740
we have the notebook bar the notebook

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,289
bar is a horizontal bar on top of the

86
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:51,199
screen of course this is similar to what

87
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,440
most users of Microsoft Office are

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,930
seeing on the screen since version 2007

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,910
so that is but we wanted to have a

90
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,849
positioning for that and of course this

91
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:08,289
is something that we have tried to

92
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:13,150
emulate the good marketing or of

93
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,940
proprietary software companies so we

94
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,940
have called our interface muffin some

95
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,120
people thinks that this is a cupcake but

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,020
we call it muffin okay so it's my

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,610
user-friendly and flexible interface and

98
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,250
of course my because it's personal user

99
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,169
friendly because it's user friendly you

100
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,270
don't need to explain it is flexible

101
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,360
because you have different options and

102
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,570
and it's the interface and I think that

103
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,810
next slide shows the it's on the on our

104
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,940
block after the announcement it was

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,930
amazing so these are the eats after the

106
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,310
announcement on the of the user

107
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,630
interface and these are the eats after

108
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,330
the announcement of the 5.3 so you see

109
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,699
and this is why I think is important to

110
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,509
it people may think that announcing of

111
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,990
the user interface may be a minor thing

112
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,710
it was not minor at all 80,000 page

113
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,729
views in one day well usually we are

114
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,539
around 15,000 so it was four or five

115
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,960
times as many and this is thanks to the

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,449
work of what I said developers that have

117
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,310
made the user interface workable and

118
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,080
designers that have made the user

119
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,650
interface up and as it is and I've tried

120
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,770
to put everything together but I think

121
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,779
that the merit is on the technical side

122
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,550
because again if you don't have

123
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,770
something that works you cannot announce

124
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,289
anything and I think I've been a lot

125
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,589
shorter than suppose and over if you

126
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,930
have questions but don't ask me about

127
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,669
technical stuff on the user interface

128
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,460
other people are able to answer these

129
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:14,680
questions so I'm finished it was not art

130
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,419
but I think if you have questions on on

131
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,550
the user interface we have the people

132
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,919
that have made it possible so you can

133
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,870
ask technical questions and I think

134
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,779
people is able to answer they're not me
