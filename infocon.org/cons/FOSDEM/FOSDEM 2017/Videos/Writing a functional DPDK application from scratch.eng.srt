00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:18,000
[Music]

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,149
[Music]

4
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,280
[Applause]

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:57,860
production about this project is

6
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:08,299
complement and its support and its

7
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:16,979
architecture and its so that's the

8
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,189
problem

9
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,430
hello is exercises and for different

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,090
speeds time genomics 1,400 it requires

11
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:58,020
number of packets supports it is

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,980
[Music]

13
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,050
something that packet in that timeframe

14
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,190
CP that means only 32 recycles so that's

15
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,190
yes

16
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,948
[Music]

17
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,150
[Music]

18
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,780
[Music]

19
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,960
[Music]

20
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,949
[Music]

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,599
[Music]

22
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:44,780
I spent too much time

23
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,950
[Music]

24
00:03:45,950 --> 00:04:07,230
so it is set of libraries so there will

25
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,440
be two ports a packet traffic traffic

26
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,599
generator which we want able to see

27
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,220
right now that's it in the slides

28
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,509
[Music]

29
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,160
presentation at least so perhaps in 20

30
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,220
minutes

31
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,279
[Music]

32
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,640
amazing

33
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,770
[Music]

34
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,240
suppose it requires some reservation

35
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,849
setups I will spend time here to

36
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:58,919
describe them if you switch face so

37
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,910
which place needs to be set up also

38
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,120
[Music]

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:32,058
[Music]

40
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,360
[Music]

41
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,329
[Music]

42
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,489
[Music]

43
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:29,709
[Music]

44
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,220
[Music]

45
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,790
[Music]

46
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:43,120
and next stage

47
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,629
[Music]

48
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,670
[Music]

49
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,789
[Music]

50
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:52,270
this is just some API to control it also

51
00:08:52,270 --> 00:09:05,050
has some sort of helper function and the

52
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,329
next thing that's also something

53
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,819
[Music]

54
00:09:29,840 --> 00:10:05,910
because concept which is indeed fixed

55
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,990
signs of memory managed very so instead

56
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,510
of reallocated allocating port you are

57
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,570
getting some memory information from

58
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,030
their drink and put it back well fixed

59
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,180
site

60
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,810
so pocket Ambo and again member is like

61
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:34,839
escape of a data structure that Ford

62
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,899
indicates both metadata and data a bit

63
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,170
of structure to point a network packet

64
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,779
so when you network practice if

65
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,459
something in that store to memory

66
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,310
that's reference to point them

67
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,309
[Music]

68
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,650
[Music]

69
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,850
[Music]

70
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:23,429
next is many due to network cards okay

71
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,289
we have some handles for them so we can

72
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,599
access their driver appeared to do a 50

73
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:33,149
this is just preparations for insulation

74
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:53,159
to configure a TANF device it is

75
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,870
to show API documentation is already

76
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,790
online if you are doing something you

77
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,500
can find it and for example bet okay it

78
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,050
got configure port ID or excuse take

79
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,480
screws and a concretions truck which has

80
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,720
this there are different like smoke

81
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,600
thick smoke configurations here in the

82
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,580
sample which has nothing at all as you

83
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,090
can go and refer to API documentation

84
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:54,909
[Music]

85
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,010
[Music]

86
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:23,749
because each is the memory location

87
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,239
mixed poops is data into fuels and we

88
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:34,729
are using a to process that data so if

89
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,589
you want to process now that we can do

90
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,839
is put data into neutral memory

91
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:56,959
locations and use different traffic can

92
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,179
be adapted to different views with

93
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,259
different ways

94
00:14:03,639 --> 00:15:13,809
and we are

95
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,570
[Music]

96
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,480
[Music]

97
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,000
application okay I can see some new

98
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,120
argument that is sinister a bunch of

99
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,980
aliens one of them is - W which white

100
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,920
leads the pcre devices so my system has

101
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,819
many devices but I don't want

102
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,670
application so that's the way of saying

103
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,930
here is on the dissenters already

104
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:23,439
supported their next step that's mainly

105
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,339
to show you can set up a place that you

106
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:44,740
can use can manage the course again for

107
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:53,829
the pepperonis special right now the API

108
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:59,470
RTA lunch and this is the circuit master

109
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,699
so it will run this application for each

110
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,030
course exact the master the master is

111
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,770
the first chord that

112
00:17:21,099 --> 00:18:13,190
so I'll parameter says you duplicate

113
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,690
application only use these course

114
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,390
example it is since none of them

115
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,450
application just exit and if we say

116
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,450
application

117
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,830
[Music]

118
00:18:35,830 --> 00:19:55,990
so this other part

119
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
now

120
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,709
[Music]

121
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:23,248
[Music]

122
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,169
[Music]

123
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,589
[Music]

124
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:09,080
[Music]

125
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:22,630
[Music]

126
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:36,470
[Music]

127
00:21:40,879 --> 00:22:04,129
again this is how we get the

128
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,609
[Music]

129
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,339
[Music]

130
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,939
[Music]

131
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,779
[Music]

132
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,889
applications if you interested in

133
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,659
writing some duplicate applications as a

134
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,289
useful resource and there are many

135
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:59,450
applications some people if you want ask

136
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,220
there are a bunch of applications or

137
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,619
[Music]

138
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,410
thank you very much

139
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,609
[Music]

140
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,470
is there any other libraries available

141
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,790
there's a question I'm not associate and

142
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,040
it has kind of has to be seen because

143
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,500
it's so low level in

144
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,889
okay in the high level interface no

145
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:59,090
right now which is only see

146
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:13,140
all the is library investments primary

147
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,770
science

148
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:32,320
[Applause]
