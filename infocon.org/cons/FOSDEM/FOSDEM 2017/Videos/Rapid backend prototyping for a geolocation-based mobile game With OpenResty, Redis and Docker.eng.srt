1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,469
however them my

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,930
hey listen exam de Gladish and today I

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,150
will tell you about rapid back-end

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,340
prototyping for a girl jo location-based

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,719
mobile game the opener st ladies and

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,359
Daka

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:25,470
come on sorry a little bit about the

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,039
case about the technology stack in

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,320
general and then details about the

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,739
nuances of the stack will tell you about

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,410
how the game world techy texture is laid

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,930
out hopefully I will show you a very

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,940
brief demo because the time is really

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,490
short and mentioned a little bit about

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,550
the client site and after conclusion

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,800
maybe we will have a little bit of time

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,870
for the questions otherwise I will be

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,000
here a little bit about me I'm

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,050
developing software since 2002 most of

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,320
the time in game development and lots of

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,180
things beyond the game development now

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,289
as well well I know a Waterson Lua

23
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,689
programming language it's my favorite

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,840
one and we are holding the conference in

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,409
Moscow this March there would be

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,880
hopefully some topics on the game

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,530
development so you're welcome to come

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,979
here what are the games with your

29
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,409
location anyone knows what this is okay

30
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,990
so those are the games with go location

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,869
given the success of that game we

32
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,069
decided to try to invent something to

33
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:48,090
prototype a number of ideas on the

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,030
gameplay we had and so while to figure

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,219
out what what's fun what's not what

36
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,590
figure what works out what what doesn't

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,060
and figure out what are the technical

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,319
limitations of the thing too as a result

39
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,560
less than two calendar months and about

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,150
100 hours we have playable prototype for

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,519
mostly for the server-side technology

42
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,440
but if

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,250
small client and it's enough to get us

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,940
rapidly iterating on the gameplay while

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,130
they start stalkers above this talk is

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,860
about technological side not the game

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,070
design not many ties ation not not

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,440
something like that so some of the

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,420
examples will be silly from the gameplay

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,950
standpoint I'm talking about technology

51
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,350
well right now it's easier than ever I

52
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,910
believe to develop the gear

53
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,180
location-based games and I believe that

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,820
there's quite a lot of space for

55
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,400
creativity there quite a lot of space of

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,160
the new free no new things not to repeat

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,000
the other major brands but just took

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,090
have fun since it's so easy it's easy to

59
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,350
have fun as a developer to not only as a

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,040
player here's a gameplay for the

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,080
prototype it's quite simple really

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,680
the player with his phone in his head

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,400
and sorry walks around he searches for

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,670
mobs monsters that is which placed on

65
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,600
the map if finds a monster he can try to

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,870
collect it there's a certain chance that

67
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,730
the monster you escaped otherwise so a

68
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,560
statistics counter gets increased when

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,700
player's profile

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,380
most vanished and valuate responds after

71
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,230
a certain time and basically that's it

72
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,500
other than that admin users may add new

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,580
mobs on the map new spawn points for the

74
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,830
initial prototype that's quite enough

75
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,690
you have to start small but so small

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,540
that not so small that you don't lay

77
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,459
down the foundation for the next new

78
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,389
features so start small but generic

79
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:32,530
the sequiturs is something we used on

80
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,340
other projects it's something the

81
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,729
familiar if you can choose of course

82
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,759
something else but I'm talking about

83
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,220
what we did it's readies the as the

84
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,060
better database opener st as web server

85
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,810
and application server docker as a thing

86
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,900
to hold it all together

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,530
that's for server for client though

88
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,030
that's a single page web application in

89
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,530
the browser we fetched email five

90
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:15,520
implementation of the client for us it's

91
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,159
a reliable proven solution which luckily

92
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,069
supports positioning out of the box here

93
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,080
two commands for the radius related to

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,069
that you can google them up radius is

95
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,250
wrong has nice set of primitives to

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,520
store the game object data and well

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,130
since we're coding in Lua our

98
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,210
application on the server side it kind

99
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,930
some counts as a nice bonus radius has

100
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,919
stored procedures in Lua never use them

101
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,370
actually for this project but the if you

102
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,630
play places they can be useful and why

103
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,529
up investing investing what what it is

104
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,949
first

105
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,870
open our season nginx web server

106
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,240
distributive not which supports

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,819
out-of-the-box no radius and many other

108
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,050
useful things and no other is you have

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,069
an option to install a newer but for the

110
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,620
fastest performance not that it's needed

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,460
for the prototype of course but still

112
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,489
you can use legit which is much faster

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,510
so open rest is something very fast

114
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,930
quite friendly at least to me and

115
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,880
well-maintained there are some large

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,940
corporations behind it let me move the

117
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,000
cursor though sorry and it's useful as

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,640
for quick prototyping as well as for the

119
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,740
production environment we use it on

120
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,090
production on other projects we use

121
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,610
Redis too and the docker is a good thing

122
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,820
for us because usually when you have a

123
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,690
complicated ecosystem on the server side

124
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,630
it's a pain to set it up for each single

125
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,030
developer okay for prototype there may

126
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,790
be single one developer but then you

127
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,610
have to deploy it somewhere and it's do

128
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,040
the same thing in again with dock away

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,110
you have reproducible environment which

130
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,570
you just write once the dock your file

131
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,820
and after this you can set up the docker

132
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,170
container so you need to just leave a

133
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,600
few comments but for us is that okay

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,580
it's really good for developers you

135
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,040
don't have to teach you every single

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,110
developer to set it the set your project

137
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,910
up but it is arguable if it is suitable

138
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,400
for production because there are certain

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,010
performance problems certain reliability

140
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,080
problems which can arise still

141
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,280
unfortunately on the high Awards so to

142
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,700
say but that's a prototype that doesn't

143
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,170
matter so you can set up doc environment

144
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,260
on your server really quickly for the

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,299
prototype and then decide what to do

146
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,330
with it one point though doc usually is

147
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,530
outdated on Linux is at least in a

148
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,020
brutal not to say about Linux is in

149
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,670
general so you have to

150
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,490
updated to sufficiently recent version

151
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,310
and I don't know maybe it's changed with

152
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,720
the last release haven't seen it so and

153
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,829
the browser well it's for this project

154
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,450
we have prototype in the server side

155
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,610
first so the client doesn't matter much

156
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,529
but still the game has to be playable

157
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,620
you can of course as a developers and

158
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,380
see you all queries from the common line

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,320
but it's not fun and it's hard to do

160
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
from the mobile phone while you're

161
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,140
walking around and playing the game so

162
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,690
some client has to be there and you have

163
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,850
to have a map you have to have a list of

164
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,750
game objects but if you remember this

165
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,720
original title we are talking about in

166
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
the first place there's certain kind of

167
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,100
combat there you can imagine this in

168
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,190
your head in general don't implement

169
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,450
anything you can imagine it is first at

170
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,220
first so you are sure you can implement

171
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,120
later for us it's not a problem to well

172
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,610
do this kind of thing not tied to the

173
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,519
allocation and the gear location is the

174
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,740
main topic here so we skip the battles

175
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,600
they skipped out the frills and the

176
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,860
client is pretty basic now the problem

177
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
here is that allocation data data

178
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,149
accesses rather limited on the browser

179
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:27,149
but it's okay for our purposes and well

180
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,370
I will skip some of the slides you can

181
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,199
read them later we have little time so

182
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,600
the developer machine deck is very

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,470
simple the client wishes browser

184
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,480
connects to the localhost port

185
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,010
and there those two square boxes sitting

186
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,690
docker open resti

187
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,270
shows HTTP requests and talks to radius

188
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,120
which resides in another dr. container

189
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,730
here is the configuration for the Redis

190
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,720
it's almost works out of the box and I

191
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,390
will not read it to save the time here's

192
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,370
the configuration for nginx the

193
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,680
interesting parts basically you saw

194
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,630
these statics the static here from the

195
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,670
index and you solve the rest like API

196
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,020
for your application at another URL and

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,310
well that's it

198
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,950
one thing to note here though is - you

199
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,140
have to disable the lower code cache and

200
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,060
for faster loading so you change the

201
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,000
code on your computer and it's it's on a

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,400
server it drops the performance a bit

203
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,740
but you don't care that's a prototype

204
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,440
and here's a docker file for the open

205
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,050
rest basically it's just copies on your

206
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,690
all your code there and launches it one

207
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,440
little trick so the doc said open waste

208
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,470
he sees another docker containers you

209
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,140
have to tell it you have to tell that

210
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,110
the DNS server when the docker resides

211
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,700
right here so you have you have to

212
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:20,650
adjust resolver scope anyway the API

213
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,870
works there only three player calls to

214
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,750
get the game will start to get the

215
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,700
specific game object state that's a bit

216
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,890
redundant because the objects are here

217
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,910
as well and to call the game object

218
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,750
action and there's a few system calls to

219
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,490
create a new player to reset everything

220
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,220
to the factory state it's often lead it

221
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,980
when you're prototyping and to upgrade

222
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,150
the

223
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,880
the base that's be to the current

224
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,610
version so if you just deployed your

225
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,370
code and you version and have to change

226
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,820
the data and we are not implementing any

227
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,790
kind of back office UI to say there to

228
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,680
save the effort but they're using the

229
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,550
in-game mechanics for in game well game

230
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,490
management so certain users can be made

231
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,600
at mean and free game actions so they

232
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,110
can change the world if they they have

233
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,210
the proper permissions how much time do

234
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:31,900
they object now for server

235
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,240
they won't consist of game objects and

236
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,660
game objects only a game objects has

237
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,490
numeric characteristics and the list of

238
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,870
fractions

239
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,560
it may have coordinates and if it

240
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
doesn't it's a prototype for another

241
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,950
game object or it it's inside another

242
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,020
game object like an a item in inventory

243
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,510
the prototypes are there to say if you

244
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,040
work on the setting up the objects in

245
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,600
the same way each time

246
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,250
so it basically prototypes object in

247
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,910
hits its properties and actions from its

248
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,820
prototypes and a prototype can have a

249
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620
prototype as well so that's a like

250
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,170
inheritance in programming

251
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,970
[Music]

252
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,810
characteristics well this slide talks

253
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,150
about how they derive from the prototype

254
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,589
doesn't matter dem objects actions as

255
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,529
well so he said here's an object it's a

256
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,540
green thought monster well here it is

257
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,070
the toward itself it has a UUID unique

258
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:51,220
ID so it has a position and it has a

259
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,520
reference to a prototype here's its

260
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,400
prototype which is

261
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,529
specific prototype of this kind of

262
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,600
monster once it sets the escape chains

263
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,460
for it and here's it it has a prototype

264
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,390
in itself and that prototype well it's

265
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:15,880
it says they'll spot respawn time and

266
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,830
here's the implementation of an action

267
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,420
that catches them up we'll skip it one

268
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,839
interesting feeling red is that you can

269
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,270
using the sorted ranges you can

270
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,130
implement the delayed action execution

271
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,800
you don't create any kind of Chrome you

272
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,070
just in each query to your server check

273
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,850
if there are any actions to be executed

274
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,880
by this time and execute them in

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,560
production you will have to limit this

276
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,450
by the number of actions to execute

277
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,430
right now but for the prototype it works

278
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,400
here's an interesting item it makes it

279
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,850
anyone who wears it administrator it

280
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,520
wants user admin rights here's how we

281
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,030
give the admin half the player and

282
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,650
here's how the start

283
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:20,170
inventory items work is how the objects

284
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,000
attached to another object work sorry

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,350
for skipping this not no time here's a

286
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:32,380
spawn point for mob well what else a

287
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,480
demo let me show you the demo quickly is

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,200
quite basic you can open it yourself and

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,360
play a little bit on the mobile phone

290
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,459
don't forget to change the user idea

291
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,100
otherwise you will be jumping it out as

292
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,110
you see no authorization it doesn't

293
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,730
matter because it's a prototype only

294
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,140
people who know it played and the link

295
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,720
later in in slides as you can see

296
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,220
there's a map here's a green toad and

297
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,069
me under if it and here's a another

298
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,010
group thought I placed yesterday there's

299
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,309
me I have an admin hat I removed it

300
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:18,220
let's done it if the internet works no

301
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,000
problem and there's a green thought it's

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,159
name is Bradley Perry the names are

303
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,980
randomly generated by a JavaScript

304
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,890
library based on this as a seed it's

305
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,470
very useful because this it you can't

306
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,070
remember it

307
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,668
and here's another user nearby anyway

308
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,340
what else case how the client what not

309
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,530
not interesting slide no problem here's

310
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,600
a trick how to launch the Google Maps I

311
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,240
found that all the examples in the

312
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,289
internet rock 100 so I have to compile

313
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,260
it together and well the problems the

314
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,570
problem here is a noisy position data

315
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,789
from client and extremely low precision

316
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:05,679
of their location in buildings but

317
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,090
there's no other problems actually

318
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,159
that's technical limitations you have to

319
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:11,590
adjust the gameplay for well what's

320
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,169
missing the event system is sorely

321
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,870
missing it has to be added to the engine

322
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,789
and lots of small functions like the

323
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,230
Demeter the number of steps you take

324
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,750
enou meters you walked so it can tie

325
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,480
some gameplay mechanics to it well

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,900
that's a prototype after you done with

327
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,630
the prototype after you understand how

328
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,510
it should work throw everything away

329
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,659
well it doesn't work but ok at least

330
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,600
start over and thoughtfully move parts

331
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,820
do parts of the code they're not just

332
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,809
reuse and cut around because in the end

333
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,330
close to release it would not work at

334
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,929
all and thank you that's it sorry for

335
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,440
skip slides

336
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,440
do it have a moment for questions oh

337
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,700
good

338
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:24,340
anyone sorry can you figure out beyond

339
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,830
the coordinates if I'm in the city the

340
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,450
player in the sea or somewhere else but

341
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,160
yes you can but you have to get the

342
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,230
coordinates to the zone data somewhere

343
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,690
there is open sleep state map project

344
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,700
which I believe that's something like

345
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,390
this so if you will tie this to do this

346
00:19:45,390 --> 00:20:00,520
before that will work three parts of

347
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,240
technologies here ready stalker and open

348
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,030
rested openness is there the application

349
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,150
code is the recording law that defines

350
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,600
your server-side game logic next

351
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,959
question please

352
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,460
no questions yes is this a game here

353
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,250
you're trying to the the Golda prototype

354
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,810
is to experiment with the technologies

355
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,130
or your China are you gonna make an

356
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,480
open-source game that what's the goal of

357
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,660
the prototype equation well for us the

358
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,820
goal of the prototype is to understand

359
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,840
how the games the girl location games

360
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,050
work whatever like a list of ideas for

361
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,220
several pages which try this try this

362
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,470
try this stuff and without something

363
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,310
easy which we can rapidly iterate we

364
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,740
cannot try these those ideas of course

365
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,550
the technology is second and that's

366
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,800
important only because you have to

367
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,500
filter those ideas by the technology

368
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,130
limitations but that's it no I'm sorry I

369
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,520
don't have the you all on my so do i I

370
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,340
probably called all the come on everyone

371
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:32,390
write down this logic editor calm if you

372
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,080
want sources or torque slides they they

373
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,840
are there I will publish the

374
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,780
english-language stock slides there

375
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,560
today and in the game there as well it's

376
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,350
available for everyone to play so it's a

377
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,030
little small open source game

378
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,440
patches and contributions are welcome I

379
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,980
will publish them as well oh well so

380
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,929
another question are we done

381
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:06,730
I think there's a question yes patient

382
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,669
fun no authentication at all we trust

383
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:15,789
that you are his stop or for

384
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,110
implementing this can you do anything

385
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,230
out the box with ready so it depends on

386
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,720
the platform sorry how to do the

387
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,029
authentication properly in this game

388
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,460
it depends on the problem on the

389
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,580
platform you're targeting because users

390
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,730
don't like to type in passwords you have

391
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,529
to tie into Facebook or Google+ sorry or

392
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,070
whatever so you basically the proper

393
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,249
client would not be just a patient a

394
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,320
browser it will will be an application

395
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,820
and case can campaign HTML no problem if

396
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,539
the technology suits you but you will

397
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,759
have some framework and you will tie the

398
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,460
alpha authentication from this framework

399
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,919
to this game if you will worry about

400
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,619
this prototype being secured just that

401
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,740
basic off there at your nginx config and

402
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,409
that's it

403
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:14,409
well in Surbiton HTTP as I did because

404
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,549
the chrome limits the Gale location the

405
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,450
data on plain HTTP another question

406
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,720
please

407
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:35,120
yes please you are correct

408
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,000
it doesn't matter how can you be sure

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,340
that the coordinates clients and you are

410
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,450
correct

411
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,120
like I said it doesn't matter much

412
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,510
because well it will be probably a

413
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,760
problem for the final game but then you

414
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
will have the proper application where

415
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,610
you it would be harder to hack right

416
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,610
right here it's easy to hock but you

417
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,570
just trying it out so if you worried

418
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,240
about hacking this first the people have

419
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,250
to start to care about your game enough

420
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,970
to hock it and as long as you don't pay

421
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,340
money to people who come to a certain

422
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,270
place you can forget about this until

423
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,760
release until better at least

424
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:32,309
[Applause]
