1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,149
right

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,180
so I'm aleeah's we're going to talk

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:16,209
about some fun stuff and well

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,970
OpenStreetMap I'll start I guess with

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,660
the usual question who here knows about

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:29,830
the OpenStreetMap awesome now who here

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,558
does not like the OpenStreetMap

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,239
oh that's great you're a terrible person

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,170
we would need to talk

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,579
but when opposite map well gives plenty

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:51,519
of reasons not to like itself and it's a

12
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,339
great project it's open under license

13
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:57,069
much like build which must so make sure

14
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,729
you'd stolen happy it was made by a

15
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,350
programmer who didn't know anything

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,219
about geography

17
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,780
it has great data model which leaves a

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,340
room for some creativity and when I

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,149
explain OpenStreetMap I usually after

20
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,570
that mention that the moment you click

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,359
the Save button all your changes

22
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,490
I immediately uploaded to the server and

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,289
in a couple of minutes everyone can

24
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:26,969
season

25
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,259
that's awesome there is no moderation

26
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,539
you can just map and in real time see

27
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:38,429
the changes in the map and interesting

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,799
basically the first question everyone

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,159
asks not about how to do something with

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,850
OpenStreetMap but you know what if I

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,009
would like to draw something like this

32
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:56,950
in OpenStreetMap or sometimes this or

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,549
move somewhere else around well what is

34
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,560
it is people wanting so much to break

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,609
things or like this or maybe delete some

36
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:11,140
stuff yeah will it break the

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,280
OpenStreetMap well for a bit but those

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,140
communities that

39
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,569
all the time watches edits there are

40
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,350
some very useful tools that like who

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,140
digit in which you can subscribe to area

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,860
you live in like jet analyzer which

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,959
relies edits that are suspicious and we

44
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,250
have tools to deal with that so it's not

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,380
a long-term solution to break your

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,739
helper system because in a couple of

47
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,140
days or if you're like in a couple of

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,600
years all your vandalism will be

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,299
reverted and the map will still be great

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,220
so we could look for another solution

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,290
because you know opposite map is open

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,360
it's based completely on open-source

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,070
software stack so maybe we could just

54
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,640
sit and wait for it to break by itself

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
not open-source you know will it work

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,650
well indeed once there was a time when

57
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,049
some identifiers surpassed their 4-byte

58
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,620
a signet int limit and some core

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,620
software broke broke but in a couple of

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,579
days the community has fix it and the

61
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,720
project still works so you might think

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,200
that opposite map lasts and nothing can

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,250
break it but actually we found the

64
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,329
solution it's not I think we're proud of

65
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:58,260
and the key to break in the project is

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,460
basically you don't you need to not want

67
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,740
to break it you need to visit well and

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,140
to work everyday on improving it and

69
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,010
then one moment you you'll find that the

70
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,269
comments saying if that you've heard the

71
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,420
thing most that you laugh applies well

72
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,710
to the open projects a bit about me I

73
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,370
work at maps me this is an app for

74
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,620
Android iOS it it's basically a river

75
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,230
for OpenStreetMap started a long time

76
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,560
ago just out of a need to have some

77
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,580
offline maps on travels without

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,680
requirements for Internet it's

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,650
completely offline and from that it

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,140
started to grow nowadays it's got better

81
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,490
UI and 3d buildings you see and some

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,130
useful stuff on main to cards routing

83
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,940
sharing whatever a lot of stuff it's an

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,040
app store on Google Play you can you

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,700
should download it and a lot of people

86
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,910
over the time have liked it installed so

87
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,180
right now we have 11 million users who

88
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,270
use the application monthly to give a

89
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,910
scale that's exactly the population of

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,530
Belgium well in the time where is no

91
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,270
FOSDEM around but yeah so we thought

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,790
that we really liked OpenStreetMap it

93
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,500
has allowed us to make this great

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,130
application and to get some money so we

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,400
want to contribute something back

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,790
but we're only a team of 20 so directly

97
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,520
mapping won't to give much failure to

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,680
post it up so we decided to share the

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,290
thing we had the most least 11 million

100
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,419
users so we implemented a simple editor

101
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,700
in the application it's really easy just

102
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,639
click a point and there are some

103
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,370
a simple form and stuff like that no

104
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,460
checks no geometry just sends data top

105
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,669
of statement no you have to log into

106
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,449
opposite Maps through the application

107
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,020
yeah and it works not as well as we

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,590
hoped not millions of users but still

109
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,360
many thousands it immediately increased

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,909
new contributors user base as you can

111
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,550
see a lot of graphs and we consider it a

112
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,270
success

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,789
I've built a tool to monitor the edits

114
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,719
and as you can see recently we surpassed

115
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,849
1 million edits with our application

116
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,610
it's around hundred thousands of users

117
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,210
and the thing I'm proud of the most is

118
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,599
that it's not regular people from

119
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,969
regular countries that you can see on

120
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,710
OpenStreetMap like Western Europe and

121
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,460
yes you can see Iraq Philippines in the

122
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,240
top ten and so on so it's there are

123
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
people from all over the world

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,900
improving opposite map through the

125
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,939
editor and from the opposite website it

126
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,250
is really really simple you can do

127
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,979
basically there's two things with Maps

128
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,169
Mir is either create new points or

129
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,199
change attributes and that's all it and

130
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,990
this is about the directly opposite map

131
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,500
without any practice and stuff so what

132
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,539
could go wrong basically it's very

133
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,960
simple you can you cannot do you cannot

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,430
break any relations with it and stuff so

135
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,990
but some people have started to notice

136
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,360
some with weird things like quite a lot

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,819
of people we're very very many people

138
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,279
have started to mark their forums homes

139
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,370
on the map it's it's weird you know

140
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,770
there are a couple of security tricks

141
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,789
going on right now somewhere around here

142
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,490
how to protect private information stuff

143
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,729
but a lot of people don't care they just

144
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,759
this is my home this is home homes of

145
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,459
all my friends and there are roads which

146
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,990
I take to get to them

147
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,419
it's weird when there were some Chinese

148
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,729
tourists there okay but they started

149
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,020
renaming all the attractions adding a

150
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,240
name in Chinese or in Russian or a

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,458
Korean which also looked weird and

152
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:48,339
mappers didn't like it and there's

153
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,250
basically a lot of stuff that you can't

154
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,940
explain

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,640
mostly looks like people just making for

156
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,640
themselves like adding these Caravan

157
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,220
sites and mobile phone shops which are

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,430
obviously not there look yeah and of

159
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,440
course mappers from a post even came to

160
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,300
us and said you are breaking the

161
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,990
OpenStreetMap please fix it and we

162
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,190
started to think how do we do that

163
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,970
okay another month of work they finally

164
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,680
within fixed yet so we put a big panel

165
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,110
with warning that everything you map you

166
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,110
are sending to the global database and

167
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,430
billions of people will see that so

168
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,790
please don't add your homes and we

169
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,980
forbidden to edit default names that

170
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,220
shown maps so users can't at Chinese

171
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,250
names trees and it is some monitoring

172
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,990
invalidation just to be sure okay so

173
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,310
this should have worked but not as great

174
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,890
as we hoped first since we forbid a

175
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,890
vision editing default names the

176
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,050
multi-language names which started to

177
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,270
differ from default names as you can see

178
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,480
here and here is just in one hour so it

179
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,800
was little frustrating and people were

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,829
still adding their homes

181
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,509
but but now we could say that that is

182
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,410
not our fault

183
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,839
every user have seen that warning so can

184
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,910
check this users it's not our problem

185
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,459
and then the code of dealing with

186
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,009
OpenStreetMap of converting our fill

187
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,249
types or field values toca system has

188
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:44,300
grown big and some our mistakes that

189
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,499
started seeping on the map like some of

190
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:51,559
my internal checks were editor opposite

191
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,019
up not much like a hundred texts on the

192
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,910
home world but some mappers made a big

193
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,939
deal out of it with posts and a lot of

194
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:04,819
Diaries with discussions of forum foul

195
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,069
maths me is destroying their map with

196
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,019
their stags that can be easily cleaned

197
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,670
up and stuff yeah

198
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,629
then we found out that we broke in some

199
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:19,970
addresses in some parts by translating

200
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,779
the street names it is really a big deal

201
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,089
and we're working on fixing that well we

202
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,249
fixed it in the application but there

203
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:32,119
are some left but nobody in opposite map

204
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,389
virtually nobody has noticed it and

205
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,939
which I think proves that mappers are

206
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,579
not concerned with data quality and

207
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,160
mostly with maps me but still and the

208
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,499
licensing issue we see a lot of well

209
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,170
some people that are adding thousands of

210
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,540
addresses onto the map using our

211
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,209
application but we're not sure they're

212
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,629
using proper sources or open license

213
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,920
sources but we can check it not sure we

214
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,980
can what we can do with it right so to

215
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,069
go a bit back first this is really great

216
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:18,619
application and it allows you to add a

217
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,769
lot of places to update open hours and

218
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,819
stuff if you like to improve the map and

219
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,589
a lot of people are using it so when we

220
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,610
had the editor I finally mapped a show

221
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,440
you know my home which has which I was

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,950
too lazy to map for previous two years

223
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,730
stuff and OpenStreetMap is not only

224
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,610
great it in most cases the only choice

225
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,980
you have when you need to when you need

226
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,860
need a map and of course will have it

227
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,470
very much and I myself bill being on the

228
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,990
board adore it very much but underneath

229
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,480
all the all the success stories so the

230
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,170
great data the data module of opposite

231
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,410
nap is not as good as it could be so if

232
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,640
you try to do the simple editor for

233
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,770
people who don't care for OpenStreetMap

234
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,040
who inator

235
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,470
not for ten thousands of people who know

236
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,640
how to choose text from ten thousand

237
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,510
different texts they use you know that

238
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,150
taking wiki pages sound like 50 screens

239
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,480
long and it's impossible to select so we

240
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,310
wanted just to make an it or for

241
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,620
millions of people just to make it

242
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,610
easier and when you try to Mary Mary

243
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,750
there too is the opposite map data model

244
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,220
most times you feel like this and there

245
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,560
is always something for that you need to

246
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,500
fix yeah but we're still working on that

247
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,440
we're improving validation and other

248
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,090
companies are looking for quality of

249
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,430
data so yeah with that are not big

250
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,260
problems just things we're working

251
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,200
working on and nothing from the start

252
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,230
opposite my project like any open

253
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,600
project out there wanted to have more

254
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,870
editors it was its goal since day one I

255
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,850
guess and in the last year the number of

256
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,250
its daily contributors has doubled from

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,400
three to six thousand editor daily and

258
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,740
it's great and maps me has contributed

259
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,290
to a lot and pokémon's

260
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,380
Canty visited but that's another funny

261
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,490
story and somehow mappers are not happy

262
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,459
they've got thousands new contributors

263
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,269
but well not as great as they'd hoped so

264
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,839
I guess the lesson is be careful what

265
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,329
you wish for

266
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,540
Yeah right

267
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,290
I guess we have a lot of time patience

268
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,430
well first our yeah do I think that

269
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,650
opposite map would survive a coordinated

270
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,270
big attack on it and first they pay slow

271
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,720
enough that you can add a lot of data in

272
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,350
the short time and if you do there are

273
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,510
always backups from a previous day from

274
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,420
the previous hour and if it's really bad

275
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,910
and the map is broken then you can just

276
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,260
revert it all the history is stored so

277
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,880
it's not big deal and well our system

278
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,370
means up pretty active and they tend to

279
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:29,560
notice this stuff early on right about

280
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,660
maps me on f-droid that's not for us we

281
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,290
don't plan to support an F droid version

282
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,380
but all the code is open it's on github

283
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,180
so anyone can build an Android version

284
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,350
and the main barrier for publishing it

285
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,350
on F droid was that nobody could find a

286
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,810
server to host their own version of maps

287
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,980
so if you have a server with just 40

288
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,580
gigabytes of disk drive you can go to

289
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,660
every f-droid ticket in math nice easy

290
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,680
tracker and offer your help and that way

291
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,380
we can have an F Jewett version right I

292
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,390
can answer questions for OpenStreetMap

293
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,560
for maps me whatever

294
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,460
right a question about maps me slowing

295
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,950
down in the in past months I guess

296
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,960
well obviously when you're improving

297
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,650
application gets slower this time but

298
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,320
first of course it's all for reason

299
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,720
because for example just a month ago we

300
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,000
edit real-time traffic information and

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,240
to render it is to get some processor

302
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,420
time from other things so it gets more

303
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,450
slow and stuff so yeah it gets slower

304
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,410
but we have really great graphics team

305
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,830
graphic engine team so they're working

306
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,340
on improving things a bit so yeah it

307
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:33,040
will be just you have to wait yes it is

308
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,250
a companies that that was bought by a

309
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,630
Russian company mail.ru it has long

310
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,250
around 20 people of them around 13 are

311
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,290
programmers and yeah it's not a separate

312
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,440
company its subdivision but we're pretty

313
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,070
independent

314
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,570
the business model of maps may currently

315
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,450
there isn't one that's sustainable we

316
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,240
still spend more money than we earn but

317
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,990
last year we started to make partnership

318
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,970
with our other companies like you can

319
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,150
book hotels from WebSphere we are

320
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,690
booking.com and you can call it an uber

321
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,950
and some other stuff so we have these

322
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,930
partnerships and we have some plans to

323
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,280
make it sustainable but it's absolutely

324
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,310
not in an experience of the core

325
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,590
functions it will always function of

326
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,200
line it will not send some private

327
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,850
information to servers so the core

328
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,639
functions and security status thing
