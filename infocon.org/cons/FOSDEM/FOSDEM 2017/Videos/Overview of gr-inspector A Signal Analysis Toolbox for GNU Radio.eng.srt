1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,960
so right I think I should start hi my

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,840
name is Sebastian Mueller I'm a student

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,970
at Kait in cars for Germany

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,570
you

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,600
analysis it's also about automated

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,820
signal analysis automated signal

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,370
reception or if you want to call it that

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,239
way

9
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,410
signal intelligence and what first of

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,920
all reasons for doing that stuff so

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,680
first off you may want to do spectrum

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,570
monitoring for example in Germany

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,210
there's the fundus nets a contour which

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,239
has to make sure there's no misuse of

15
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,460
the spectrum and that everyone stays in

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,850
their pens and for this purpose they

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,150
need to identify where signals are and

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,670
what signals are or where they belong to

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,080
second it's super cool if you can

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,509
explore real world signals especially

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,200
when you're a beginner so for example if

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
you want to have a look at an LTE signal

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,909
and have a look at the frame and where

24
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,340
are the pilots and so on it's very hard

25
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,500
to do that if you are not like an expert

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,880
in that topic so it would be very cool

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,100
if everything can be automated and then

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,960
beginners can figure out why signals

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,240
work and why are the parameters chosen

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,670
that way and yeah why they maybe

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,110
wouldn't work otherwise also you can do

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,600
live modulation simplest example would

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,460
be if you want to listen to a local

34
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,220
radio station you you're actually doing

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,490
live demodulation and you can do batch

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,450
processing of several signals so you

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,280
don't have to look at one signal because

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,930
everything is happening in the

39
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,878
background automated there can be

40
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,549
several signal chains that deal each

41
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,220
with one signal so okay what what do we

42
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,019
have to do if we want to receive unknown

43
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,319
signals first off we have to detect them

44
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,230
so the question is where is the signal

45
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,120
located in the spectrum and what's it

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,040
bent with if we have done that we need

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,230
to mix it down into complex baseband and

48
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,950
then we would do something like filter

49
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,210
decimated yeah two to two

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,430
able to handle the amount of samples and

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,080
next you you would start like an

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,390
iterative cycle of analysis and then

53
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,380
yeah you're doing step two the

54
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,900
modulation then analyze again some

55
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,120
parameters and so on and if you did that

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,580
some some time you will be able to

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,640
delete a signal and if it's encrypted

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,190
you also have to decrypt it so these are

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,880
all the tasks that are possible so what

60
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,490
was - workflow before this is like I did

61
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,100
it maybe you you have you have it

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,650
smarter than me but I did something like

63
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,770
this so first off there is a USRP source

64
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,780
so I just received the signal and

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,110
chopped it in a queue teasing or

66
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,850
frequency thing so I just had to look at

67
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,820
a spectrum and look and search where as

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,430
energy located because normally energy

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,630
means there could be a signal if I found

70
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,420
what I have been looking for I would

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,940
yeah assume or estimate by thumb the

72
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,120
center frequency and the bandwidth and I

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,430
would try to remember that and chop in

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,810
the next block which would be the

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,390
frequency translating FIF filter this

76
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,410
block does everything including the the

77
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,200
down mixing the decimation and the

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,230
filtering and the basement so I would

79
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,610
enter my parameters here which I found

80
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,339
out while looking at the sink the

81
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,650
frequency sink and I would just try to

82
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,610
sample as a way to a file then I would

83
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,970
do some analysis which I have done in

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,600
MATLAB I have to admit and for example

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
there are other tools like Python Skype

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,580
high or in spectrum and yeah I would I

87
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,770
would try to estimate all the parameters

88
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,620
that would be necessary to finally do

89
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,810
modulator signal and for the emulation I

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,720
would use can radio or other tools like

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,590
MATLAB or

92
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,379
whatever there is your name it so what

93
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,409
this flow graph is not that cool why is

94
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,509
it not that cool first off you have

95
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,330
often to stop in a Chester flow craft

96
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,699
like you have to start it have a look

97
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,650
estimate some things stop it again

98
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,680
shopping and more blocks and then fire

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,129
it up again and yeah I'll do this all in

100
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,909
a in a cycle you would often or I at

101
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,030
least would often try to estimate by

102
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,969
thump all the parameters like okay this

103
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,580
could be two point four five gigahertz I

104
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,610
don't know and hope that it will work

105
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,300
out and yeah it's not not possible to do

106
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,810
any real time analysis with this because

107
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,550
you always have to stop the flow craft

108
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,710
so you you need much expertise to

109
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,259
perform these steps and it's not

110
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,840
possible for a beginner like a one-click

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,900
solution so you have to really know what

112
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,620
you are doing if you get tried it that

113
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,199
way so and this is exactly where the

114
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,740
inspector comes in and it tries to make

115
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,650
these tasks I just mentioned more easy

116
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,060
and I will now go through the components

117
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,580
or the plugs of ER inspector and tell

118
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,199
you what they can do so first off we

119
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,279
talked about detection and if you want

120
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,020
to detect the signal normally we do

121
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,150
energy detection like okay we assume

122
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,009
when there's energy in the spectrum

123
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,389
there could be a signal and this block

124
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,310
can do this for one or more signals and

125
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,219
it works either by setting a threshold

126
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,800
with the block parameter or there's also

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,039
an automatic algorithm that tries to

128
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,039
find power chums in the PSTN and

129
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,180
interprets them as signal edges

130
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,520
there's also functionality to suppress

131
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,180
narrow signals which which helps to

132
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,430
avoid false detections

133
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,960
and the output of this blog is first the

134
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,690
estimated PSD of the input signal and

135
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,970
the second one as you see this is a

136
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,810
message port it passes the information

137
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,979
about the center frequency and the

138
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,060
bandwidth of the detected signals so

139
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,240
next what you would do is you want to

140
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,210
visualize what you have estimated so

141
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,650
there's the QT greasing for that and it

142
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,350
just takes the estimated PSD from the

143
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,460
plug before and plot that in a cootie

144
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,570
window also it takes the pant Worth's

145
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,500
and center of center frequencies of the

146
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,930
detected signals and marks them with H's

147
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,280
yeah and next to to the markers of each

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,199
signal they're also the properties

149
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,320
plotted like Center frequency and

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,590
bandwidth and there can also be more

151
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,570
parameters that I will show on the next

152
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,190
slide and this block also enables manual

153
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,849
selection so if the automatic signal

154
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,530
detection messes up because you have a

155
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,310
bad SNR for instance you can you can do

156
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,240
a track and job selection here and this

157
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,390
is a screenshot of how the the GUI looks

158
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,580
like so what you see here are three

159
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,520
signals in the spectrum and as you see

160
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,169
the one on the left and the one on the

161
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,750
riot they just have their center

162
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,060
frequency and bandwidth plotted next to

163
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,089
them the one in the middle has more text

164
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,690
so what's up there I don't know if you

165
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,910
can read it and in the back line so this

166
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,540
is an OFDM signal and there it's an

167
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,089
analysis block that feeds the results

168
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,450
back through this group lock and the the

169
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,060
results get appended to the text printed

170
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,520
next to the markers so what we can reach

171
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,920
here is the center frequency the

172
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,160
bandwidth but also of the mo of the M

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
specific parameters like subcarrier

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,170
spacing number of subcarriers cyclic

175
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,740
prefix length

176
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,430
so now when we have detected the signals

177
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,910
that we want to use we have to do the

178
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,100
down mixing and decimation and filtering

179
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,990
and this is exactly what the signal

180
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,790
separator block does it calculates an

181
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,070
FIA filter for every detected signal and

182
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,700
applies that in complex baseband or you

183
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,630
can provide a chase and file with pre

184
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,020
calculated tabs so to save CPU usage

185
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,730
during runtime the output is a bit

186
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,740
complex here so as you see it's again a

187
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,120
message port and its format is like

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,210
first of a header that contains the

189
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,510
signal information like signal number

190
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,850
center frequency and bandwidth and then

191
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,430
what follows are the complex samples of

192
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,320
the signal now if we want to protect

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
process the signal further we have a

194
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
problem because there are nearly no

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,870
blocks that would take my my message

196
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,660
format here that I chose so there is the

197
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,720
signal extractor what it does is just it

198
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,480
extracts the complex samples of one

199
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,150
signal out of this message and passes

200
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,730
them again as complex stream as most new

201
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,610
regio blocks takes complex stream

202
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:52,020
samples yeah right yeah and also the the

203
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,660
sample rate of a signal is not known

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,670
during runtime because it tries to

205
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,580
sample following Nyquist criteria so

206
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,970
there is it depends on the bandwidth of

207
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,720
the signal

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,240
what's the sampling rate of the of the

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,300
signal after the signal separator and

210
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,280
there are applications where you need to

211
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,490
know your sample rate exactly and

212
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,620
therefore this block also has the

213
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,290
possibility to resample the signal to a

214
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,160
well-defined

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,670
sampling rate so the the second bigger

216
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,470
topic I dealt with is OFDM and there I

217
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,160
tried to

218
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,500
Ryden of the MSD major parameter

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,829
estimation we have seen the result of

220
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,899
this blog earlier in the in the GUI

221
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,560
screenshot and what it does it estimates

222
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,930
the subcarrier spacing the symbol time

223
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,060
subcarrier number and cyclic prefix

224
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,649
length of an OFDM signal and yeah as I

225
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,259
said the results can be fed back to the

226
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,569
Qt GUI inspector sync and will be

227
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:05,279
plotted next to the signal also there's

228
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,209
an OFDM synchronization block this is a

229
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,069
surprise it performs a frequency and

230
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,870
timing synchronization for of the EM

231
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,879
signals and we have also some modulation

232
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,839
classification ability this was not done

233
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,149
by me but by Christopher Richardson who

234
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,199
was a Summer of Code and space student

235
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,329
last year and he dealt with yeah

236
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:33,930
automatic modulation classification

237
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,630
using tensor flow so and now the cows

238
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,790
has demo time so what I want to do now

239
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,970
is show you a typical cheer inspector

240
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,050
flow graph where we try to listen to a

241
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,269
local radio station so I have my us F P

242
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,769
right here and these are just blocks I

243
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,040
just introduced to you so here's the

244
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,259
user P source to talk to my user P here

245
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,259
this can be exchanged by any other

246
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,649
source that provides a signal and then

247
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,519
here's the signal detector the the GUI

248
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,050
inspector sink and the results from here

249
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,120
will be fed back to the signal separator

250
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,819
where all the mixing and down sampling

251
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:27,959
and filtering will be performed since

252
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,120
we're only listening to one signal we

253
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,879
will extract it here and pass it samples

254
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,759
as a complex stream and what follows

255
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,579
then is just a basic FM demodulation

256
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,920
chain so this thing right here is

257
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,839
completely ignore a do so this was here

258
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,059
before and this box down here this is

259
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:48,840
all cheer and

260
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:59,970
spectrum so let's fire it up okay it's

261
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,360
flashing my FPGA so I maybe should have

262
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,870
done this before it should only take a

263
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:16,370
few seconds okay

264
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,089
so now we see here

265
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,179
actually now I have enabled manual

266
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:27,459
detection because I assume the the SNR

267
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,679
in here is too bad to do anything

268
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,269
automatic as you see it's pretty noisy

269
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,309
so we have one signal here and I already

270
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,980
have seen at 100 megahertz there is a

271
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,649
local radio station here in prison so

272
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:47,139
you can try to listen to that and I

273
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,049
don't think it's it's quite good printed

274
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,600
on the Beamer there our signal access

275
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,919
right here and right here and I can drag

276
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,230
and drop them to adjust the bandwidth of

277
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,660
the signal so let's try this

278
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,710
there's some kind of sweet spot for the

279
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:27,350
bandwidth let me add some more gain

280
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:41,650
okay only noise oh no okay I didn't

281
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,040
think the s and I would be too bad here

282
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,830
because at my place at work so let's try

283
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,430
this one more time

284
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,480
yeah I don't know what we can try that

285
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,060
down no so I don't know maybe you can

286
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,360
hear the bid there's some music in the

287
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,040
background but it's super noisy okay a

288
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
pity

289
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,259
yeah you can hear there's some music

290
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:35,930
maybe okay okay for the audience and the

291
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:48,110
scene yeah so okay yeah and that's it

292
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,300
thank you for your attention

293
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,740
and yeah we had it earlier about

294
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,029
participation and getting started and to

295
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,889
radio and I think google Summer of Code

296
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,289
is the super thing to to get started

297
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,819
with like I did okay any questions

298
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:19,010
Martin yes yes I think okay I know what

299
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,429
you what you want to point out so yeah

300
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:24,648
at my university we had the I Triple E

301
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:28,899
signal intelligence challenge and which

302
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:38,390
Martin did bring to life and it's all

303
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,309
about detecting signals in a in a known

304
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,740
band but you don't know anything about

305
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,020
them so you have to do the things I just

306
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,240
mentioned like detects error

307
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,650
as I said started with MATLAB and and in

308
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,250
spectrum and such things and yeah that's

309
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,860
that's what got me into this this kind

310
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,919
of topic and that's why I also applied

311
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:24,490
for ji-suk last year right yeah yeah

312
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,260
yeah it's so basically this just an

313
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,780
algorithm implemented there from a

314
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,150
published paper and let me think if I

315
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,809
can recall what it really does so yeah

316
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,310
right it's cyclo stationary features and

317
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,080
[Music]

318
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,150
if you if you do a fixed length

319
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,850
correlation over the time signal you can

320
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:03,049
find out the be used use symbol time I

321
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,230
think and then you can do the cyclo

322
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,450
stationary analysis so in frequency

323
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,290
domain and in time shift domain to to

324
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,950
find the the cyclic prefix length yeah

325
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,740
so it's just to peek searches in these

326
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,640
two directions

327
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,179
concerning which which the OFDM it's

328
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,740
it's a number of samples that you have

329
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,309
to capture and it's it's about I think

330
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:44,700
in the in the area of 7,000 samples

331
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,830
right yeah right if she has an arrow

332
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,779
spared estimation will be better so and

333
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,880
of course yeah yeah but I have tested it

334
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,590
and below 7000 samples there are no

335
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:12,000
reliable results available okay

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,190
and I think that's it thank you

337
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,459
