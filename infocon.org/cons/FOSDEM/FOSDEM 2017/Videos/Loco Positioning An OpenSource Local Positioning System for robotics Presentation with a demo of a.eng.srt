1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,800
yes what okay so hi I'm Alma Tiffany

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,700
from bit crazed and I will be talking

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,680
about the local Positioning System

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,080
that's a local Positioning System we've

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,599
been developing for the last one year

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:24,039
and a half so big craze is a company we

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,029
created to to support crazy fly

8
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,949
quadcopter that's a project we did as a

9
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,198
hobby originally and that family we

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,940
started selling so we need company to

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,360
sell it and from the origin we did that

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,479
as an open-source quadcopter and when

13
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,549
finally we could work full-time for a

14
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:50,220
company we made crazy fly 2.0 which was

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,080
yes fully designed as a flying

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,920
development platform so we did that by

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
putting a CPU that was way too powerful

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,369
in it just fly and we made an expansion

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,490
pot which we called backspin spot since

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,960
how do we know you need to give a name

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,240
so your expansion port apparently so our

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,740
subjects and this was intended to allow

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,049
allow people to add their own software

24
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,909
are they on our hardware and use that

25
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,590
the as a development platform as a

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,880
flying platform to do more with and but

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,159
since we started making quadcopter we

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,810
always wanted to make them fly

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,490
autonomously I mean it's quite easy to

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,439
or it's quite reach about to make a

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,539
quadcopter that you fly manually but

32
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,640
it's not that easy to make it fly out to

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,270
me automatically because the fan so it

34
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,310
has is a Java scarbacks air meter so it

35
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,810
will basically be able to get its

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,759
orientation in here and with the

37
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,729
orientation and the fact that we was

38
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,950
first going down so we go up we can move

39
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,890
around but if you would ask it to stay

40
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,109
stable it want to just drift away

41
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,559
eventually

42
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,869
so to fly it honestly we've tried many

43
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,788
things many hacks very early with yeah

44
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,209
up facing camera just looking OpenCV

45
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,890
detecting the copter over the white

46
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,260
ceiling the size of the copter gives us

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,069
this

48
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,629
and X Y we get base position in in the

49
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,599
picture did this didn't work really well

50
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,099
because we did not have the

51
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,769
stabilization software to actually be

52
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,459
stable above camera or actually we will

53
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,069
not have them re-- good so it tend to go

54
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,930
away from the camera field very quickly

55
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,060
so it's actually very frustrating to

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,150
work with that we have couple of tried

57
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,829
with Kinect camera those are really nice

58
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,480
because they are 3d cameras it can give

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,599
you X Y with with with the pictures guys

60
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,650
also tell you how far the objectives so

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,419
yeah we have one generation of Kinect

62
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,730
one and what we just connect to that

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,620
actually worked very well we use that at

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,049
Maker Faires and we could fly a full

65
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,199
battery time but we're still limited to

66
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,459
the field of view of the camera and all

67
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,079
software were still not so great so it

68
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,340
was still fighting stable if you get

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,849
some wind or these kind of things well

70
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,099
we also how to try with a simple webcam

71
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,829
looking at a our marker this is things

72
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,790
when you can put augmented reality

73
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,109
objects on top of your image so they

74
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:28,030
library that does that are really great

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,889
they give you the position X Y Z n

76
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,310
orientation of the marker this works

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,549
great until there is Sun so we have that

78
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,769
as a makerfaire morning no problem

79
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,449
afternoon the Sun coming to the copter

80
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,030
and nothing is detected so all that was

81
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,489
pretty brittle and our main problem was

82
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,470
that since we didn't have a proper

83
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,879
positioning system we didn't have any

84
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,759
excuse or an incentive to develop proper

85
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,889
autonomous algorithm since we didn't

86
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,659
have proper autonomous algorithm none of

87
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:02,139
these were working really great and that

88
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,909
kind of changed one and half year ago

89
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:08,859
and we discovered this chip the deck

90
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,219
iotv 1000 it's an off the shelf with

91
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,819
tri-band radio it is advertised as a

92
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,769
radio chip that can range so you can get

93
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,930
the distance using thumb flight

94
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,409
measurement between two radio chips and

95
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,909
that was great for us because then I

96
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:26,349
mean this can be the base of a local

97
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,190
Positioning System and it's also

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,370
implementing a step

99
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,340
so even though as far as we know that's

100
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,130
the only chip we can source for this

101
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,340
standard there is hope that also

102
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,990
manufacturer makes chip and we can be

103
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,870
compatible with more hardware and we can

104
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,540
choose our chips later let's say what

105
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,460
what do we call a local Positioning

106
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,290
System so it's very simple it's

107
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,010
basically like GPS but local GPS will

108
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,050
allow you to get an absolute position

109
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,580
anywhere in the world but it works

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,600
really badly indoors and that's where

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,130
making a system that will allow you to

112
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,710
get an absolute position indoors might

113
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,200
be very interesting so what we basically

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,480
want is that if we are out drawn we want

115
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,420
to know that if we are here our origin

116
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,980
will be there we want to know that we're

117
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,290
1 meter 1 meter 1 meter in the in the

118
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,410
room that's what we are trying to reach

119
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,760
the reason you would like to do that one

120
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,910
industrial reason oh yeah one more

121
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,560
common reason that is developed a lot

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,840
lately is indoor navigation but for

123
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,570
people so imagine you have a positioning

124
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,550
system in a shopping mall on airport you

125
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,830
will be able to make up that help people

126
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,300
navigate and reach the gate more easily

127
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,330
asset tracking is pretty big thing so

128
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,030
tracking assets in warehouse these are

129
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,360
expensive stuff for just packages but

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,550
what we are interested in as big phrase

131
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,610
is robotics so that's what we were

132
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,120
focusing in a system for flying robotic

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,410
or any kind robotics actually so there

134
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,510
is a system that exists already there

135
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,390
has been people using our our quadcopter

136
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,400
to do some research and autonomous

137
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,370
flight and these kind of things the most

138
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,520
use is motion capture systems so that's

139
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,260
the same system they're using movies for

140
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,830
capturing the motion of an actor so you

141
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,190
have reflectors on joints and you will

142
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,720
be able to find out how the skeleton is

143
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,639
mulling

144
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,219
but instead of that we put reflectors

145
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,650
there's these bolts here on on the

146
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,360
platform on the on the quadcopter and

147
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,129
that works really good really really

148
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,379
well you get some immature precision

149
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,110
even in a room big like that but you

150
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,689
will need you will need the dozens of

151
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,520
cameras for that and it cost a lot of

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,830
money so much that University usually

153
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,689
shares the system they buy one or two

154
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,060
and they share it between labs so it's

155
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,680
very impractical to do research when you

156
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,029
you have a limited resource

157
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,770
there's optical flow platforms that

158
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,719
exist the idea is that instead of

159
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,189
putting camera around you put camera on

160
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,009
the capture to find out how the how the

161
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,969
water is moving around you yeah and

162
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,800
there is a couple of radio system we

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,689
like radio system because it's less

164
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,159
dependent to the lightning environment

165
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,069
the use of the most developed is risk

166
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,590
received signal strength system so

167
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,870
that's what you have with this Bluetooth

168
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,560
low-energy key fob can buy to to find

169
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,089
your keys with your mobile phone but

170
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,099
basically what you will be able to get

171
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,409
is near far you will not be able to get

172
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,349
a very accurate position I know that

173
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,599
Cisco has a system to detect computers

174
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,330
if you have a lot of Wi-Fi router but

175
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,250
that same things you will get in which

176
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,810
room and roughly wearing the roomed

177
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,819
computer is that's not something very

178
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,469
useful for flying robotic not precise in

179
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,020
US where this kind of system with angle

180
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,979
detection either you detect the angle of

181
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,319
our arrival that was talked about that

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,419
yesterday in the SDR room it's pretty

183
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:27,039
nice

184
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,919
complicated and all you can also look at

185
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,820
where you are in regard to the antenna

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,799
that transmits that's used a lot by

187
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,399
planes I mean there's basically you have

188
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,870
a rotating antenna you will find out

189
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,690
where you are regarding the antenna so

190
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,880
those could be used to locate where you

191
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
are knowing the angle and finally there

192
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,750
is time-of-flight solution which is what

193
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,050
we've been using

194
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,550
there you just measure the time it takes

195
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,200
for the radio signal to go from the

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,910
transmitter to the receiver and knowing

197
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,140
the time you will know the distance

198
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,630
because you know speed of light and that

199
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,550
will allow you to get your position

200
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,260
though this requires pretty wide

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,830
bandwidth to be to work properly with

202
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,900
multipath so yeah what is you tried them

203
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,400
in more conventional radio what you're

204
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,290
selling is a narrow band signal so

205
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,150
you're basically sending a sinuous and

206
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,370
you're modulating some data around

207
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,840
asinus and what you will get is a pretty

208
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,190
narrow band in the frequency domain with

209
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,380
pre narrow bandwidth and very high power

210
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,790
what we're doing with tri-band in

211
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,990
studies that instead of sending data

212
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,300
that moderating sinners we send purses

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,290
very short verses this will result in a

214
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,820
very wide bandwidth and then we can keep

215
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,840
the power low because the the amount the

216
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,550
complete amount of power might be

217
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,700
similar but here we have 20 DBM and here

218
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,420
we have minus 41 DBM they call permeate

219
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,150
so we are really low power this radio

220
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,040
actually works below what normal radio

221
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,390
consider noise so they are legal by

222
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,580
working where you're allowed to transmit

223
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,760
noise when you have a conventional radio

224
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,000
narrowband radio that can be very

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,130
interesting to the timing to time the

226
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,890
arrival of the packet because you have a

227
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,350
shot parts to detect there is no herb

228
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,170
and you could also detect when the scene

229
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,240
is crosses zero you could detect the

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,610
face and you could get fairly accurate

231
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,610
timing like we thought as well but this

232
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,790
behaves really badly with multipath

233
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,590
so multipath is when a radio signal is

234
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,930
transmitted from yeah from transmitter

235
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,370
to receiver you will have a lot of

236
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,280
reflective surfaces all around windows

237
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,740
wall everything's a lot of things are

238
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,820
reflective to radio so when we see

239
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,110
you will receive what's called direct

240
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,490
path which is the fastest way from the

241
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,620
between the two antennas but there will

242
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,260
be a so secondary path that will be the

243
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,130
similar bounce that bounced around this

244
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,980
would be later then we arrive later and

245
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,370
so they will be delayed a little bit in

246
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,990
case of narrow band if we simplify that

247
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,780
saying it's a sinners you will get some

248
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,930
of sinesses with same frequency and that

249
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,730
will give you a sinus with same

250
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,040
frequency only problem is that amplitude

251
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,500
is modified and the phase is modified so

252
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,480
if you want to detect a face to get the

253
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,220
timing you're out ultra-wideband

254
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,080
since you send very short purses if

255
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,340
you're lucky enough that your multi

256
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,310
paths are not too close you you will

257
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,080
basically receive a couple of purse so

258
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,940
you will be able to see the first path

259
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,730
and you will be also able to see the

260
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,110
secondary passes but there is a pretty

261
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,910
cool thing actually that's not related

262
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,210
to timing but that normal radio will be

263
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,580
affected negatively by multipath that

264
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,960
would be a problem each year to try to

265
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,240
solve for example Wi-Fi what what rotors

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,420
so I will have mutable antenna to deal

267
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,290
with that among other things in a tribe

268
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,240
and the radio will be able to use the

269
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,630
energy of the do so path so each Y band

270
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,610
will work better in a corridor or in a

271
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,110
closed environment for transmitting

272
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,490
packet because we'll be able to use

273
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,550
energy of all the signal that bounced

274
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,250
around not only the one that went

275
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,320
directly to the antenna and so the way

276
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,860
that's transmitted so is a similar to a

277
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,480
conventional radio packet you have a

278
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,990
preamble

279
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,280
so whenever a radio system usually start

280
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,350
with preamble so it's a secretory

281
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,660
sequence that repeats itself usually one

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,130
zero one zero one zero and that allows

283
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,920
to synchronize the the transmitter with

284
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,810
a receiver to then get the data the

285
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,600
probable minute ride ban is a bit more

286
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,410
complex it's more like a longer so there

287
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,579
random sequence and what and it's very

288
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,800
very long and it will allow the receiver

289
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,500
to do a cross correlation between what

290
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,589
it sees in year and the they wanted

291
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,009
credible and out of that you get what we

292
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,569
call the impulse response of the channel

293
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,379
so you will get the first path and the

294
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,360
mutiple deals a path you will get how

295
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,250
much energy of the signal you get all

296
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,360
the time and then you can use that to

297
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,189
synchronize yourself and to get how much

298
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,089
energy you need

299
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,670
at which time to decode the data part

300
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,269
and while in a normal radio for example

301
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,310
the the two megabit per second radio we

302
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,620
use to communicate refine normally the

303
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,990
preamble is one byte and the packet can

304
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,500
be 32 bytes here the preamble is like

305
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,540
150 microseconds when you have 10

306
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,870
microseconds of data so it's really

307
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,370
disproportionate yeah and just point out

308
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,310
this is a normal radio it's not specific

309
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,800
things it trusts with data it's based on

310
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,220
I Triple E a 2 to 15 4 so it doesn't Mac

311
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,160
header and you can just put that I'll

312
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,439
it's just that as a side effect you will

313
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,959
be able to measure very exactly when the

314
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,089
packet leaves the internal transmitter

315
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,889
and when it arrived at the antenna of

316
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,689
the receiver so internally it looks a

317
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,189
little bit like that we took that from

318
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,300
debug registers of the radio

319
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,819
that's over time and each line here is

320
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,769
the amount of energy that was received

321
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,829
for one packet over time and that's

322
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:04,160
multiple packets we've taken back to see

323
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,860
the effect of occlusion non-line of

324
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,949
sight and here we've had some one that

325
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:12,920
passed in a way and this is one of the

326
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,370
drawback of this radio is that if if you

327
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,199
pass in the way it will actually affect

328
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,329
the timing and it doesn't work so well

329
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,819
with non-line of sight situation you

330
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:25,329
will actually get enough set because

331
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,740
yeah it kind of blurs you can see that

332
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,339
here there is a very high pick two times

333
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,589
two times the arrival of the packet when

334
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:35,110
exactly went right here

335
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,910
a bit my brewery and the algorithm that

336
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,800
searches for this peak will tend to get

337
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,500
confused so to wrap it up we we have a

338
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,019
radio that's able to give us a very

339
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,750
precise timing of when packets lives in

340
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,010
arrived they have 64 gig yards timer so

341
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,600
it's about five millimeter precision in

342
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,640
timing though it's specified for plus

343
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,970
minus ten centimeter of precision when

344
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,959
you do ranging with it

345
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,149
that's due to the fact that your timing

346
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,200
will be affected by an on line outside

347
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,630
by temperature by receive power there's

348
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,160
a lot of things that can affect your

349
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,829
precision and and yeah it's very well

350
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,329
best to multi pass which is very

351
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,790
important if you want accurate timing of

352
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,800
spagett so now that we have a radio

353
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
capable of nutrient timestamp we need to

354
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,850
use it in such a way that we can do a

355
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,550
local Positioning System with it

356
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,500
common architecture will be twelve

357
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,310
anchors and tag what we call anchors is

358
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,050
fixed radios that you place around the

359
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,079
room and you measure the position so we

360
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,610
have a couple here and just this morning

361
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,199
we measured their position so we have

362
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,390
entered them we know where they are in

363
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,690
space and the tag is a regular is going

364
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,459
to move around and that's going to want

365
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,949
to know its position all we want to know

366
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:05,559
it the position of and there is we have

367
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,660
at least we have a couple of ways we can

368
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,369
do this ranging now that we have this

369
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,679
architecture and timing capability the

370
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,410
simplest is called to arranging so we

371
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,319
will just pink so the tight sense packet

372
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,449
to the anchors the anchor answers we

373
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,400
remove the answer time and you get two

374
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,199
times the time of light divided by two

375
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,089
you get time off light the only problem

376
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,650
with that is that the time in the ekor

377
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,780
the anchor one's different clock they

378
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,059
are not synchronized they will drift

379
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,590
what is each other so if this answer

380
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,690
time is big or even if it's small

381
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,280
actually you will get a very big hour

382
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,610
very very very quick you will have zero

383
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,979
or induced by the answer time here

384
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,030
dominated the measurement so the way we

385
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,270
did with that that we just add a third

386
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,620
packet so intuitively we do to rng manip

387
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,540
in one way the ping zeros away and the

388
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,720
arrow will be symmetrical so we can get

389
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,429
our time off we can get our

390
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,910
time-of-flight measurement in a

391
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,570
beautiful club that will drift in the in

392
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,150
within the anchor and the tag now we

393
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,940
have a prime the last problem is that we

394
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,770
want in our application to have the

395
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,260
location in the capture so we want all

396
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,549
the information in the capture to

397
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,640
measure the location and here's a last

398
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,500
time stamp is in the anchor in the

399
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,890
system so we just add a force packet so

400
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,350
the current implementation transmits all

401
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,410
these free time stamps in the force

402
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,169
packet and so out of the six time sense

403
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,790
the capture can calculate time of flight

404
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,650
to the anchor and we know the distance

405
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,090
to the single Winker and it's by during

406
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,980
bi-directional communication and the

407
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,660
copter can choose a rate and can choose

408
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,330
to with which inker to range which is

409
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,799
nice because we can imagine sodium

410
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,929
ization when you would have a system in

411
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,490
this river system in the room beside

412
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,010
here and you choose to with which anchor

413
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,179
you want to range when you leave the

414
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:18,429
room and so when we have distances we

415
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,010
can place ourselves in sphere by ones

416
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,290
anchor we went with multiple anchor

417
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,000
there is multiple sphere and we will be

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,049
at the intersection so that's how we

419
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,020
calculate our position this behaves

420
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,980
quite nicely it works it works well even

421
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,350
if we leave the vicinity of the anchors

422
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,890
so even even though here we will have a

423
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,340
setup in this in a in some kind of a

424
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,200
cube here we can go away still gonna

425
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,830
work okay

426
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,390
though there is a drawback if you want

427
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,490
to do swam research for example if you

428
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,460
want to fly a lot of a lot of your

429
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,429
captures each tag will have to

430
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:01,950
communicate with the anchor we

431
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,360
means that each tag will have to

432
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,740
synchronize with each other to not

433
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,630
communicate at the same time you'll have

434
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,440
to share there and so that doesn't scale

435
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,269
really well when you want to add new

436
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:15,630
tags we've been able to run for I think

437
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,909
which suddenly could run ten with some

438
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:20,460
tea musician copters with system but we

439
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,919
cannot run 50 or 100 it's not just not

440
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,539
scaling so one solution is to instead

441
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,840
look at Prime different arrival so

442
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,490
that's very similar to how GPS is

443
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,220
working that's why you don't need more

444
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,080
boundaries in GPS CC means to try a new

445
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,080
producing GG base and what you do is

446
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,340
that you only listen and if we imagine

447
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,230
that the anchors will be able to send

448
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,279
signal exactly at the same time we could

449
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,019
just listen at when the packet arrived

450
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,330
and the difference of time of arrival

451
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,070
will give us a difference of distance

452
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,600
between the anchor we'll be able to know

453
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,279
that we were 30 centimeter closer to

454
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:05,429
anchor 1 than anchor 2 now this is not

455
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,529
it is not possible to send all together

456
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:08,880
at the same time that's not going to

457
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,019
work so we just define time slots

458
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,149
anchors sends in their time slot and we

459
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,029
just subscribe the time slot when we

460
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,230
want to do the time different arrival

461
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,010
but now we have a prime because these

462
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,440
anchors are independent radios they are

463
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,700
independent trucks and needs to be

464
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,190
synchronized together and they so that

465
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,260
we we can sing crisis timeslot and we

466
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,580
can know how long time it took between

467
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,580
two packet to be transmitted to be able

468
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,830
to measure accurately the difference of

469
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,669
time of arrival and luckily we can do

470
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,970
that with two arranging so the idea is

471
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,529
that this packet they are broadcasted

472
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,450
everyone's receiving it and so even the

473
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,240
anchors are receiving it and we we

474
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,820
recognize here as a double pink we saw

475
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,929
before which will allow us to measure

476
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,659
time of flight between two anchor and if

477
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,070
we have time of flight between need two

478
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,019
anchors we know if we have time of

479
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,610
flight because the anchor one and two

480
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,100
and we know when anchor one received a

481
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,510
packet from anchor 2 we

482
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,150
calculate when what time it was in and

483
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,280
co1 when anchor2 like it has been said

484
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,880
and this world will allow us to

485
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,560
synchronize all the system and to

486
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,730
measure a different time of arrival

487
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,090
between all the anchors once we have

488
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,250
different time of arrival we then we

489
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,140
know how close we are to an anchor

490
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,740
towards another one and it will place us

491
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,350
in a perilous

492
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,330
in space in between the two anchor

493
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,370
oppai below it I think is called in 3d

494
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,020
this works nicely when you are within

495
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,780
the anchors face so as we call that the

496
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,120
comics hold from form by sinker so

497
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
that's the space that is enclosed by the

498
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,800
you anchor system then you get similar

499
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,530
performance and with two-way arranging

500
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,690
the prime is that it degrades very very

501
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,210
quickly when you get away and I mean we

502
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,860
can see that here that if you would be

503
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,450
here you have an intersection of the two

504
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,700
parabola which is very shadow so a

505
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,120
little noise will mean a very big

506
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,160
uncertainty in your position so this

507
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,500
case really well once you have managed

508
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,900
to arrange one capture with that you can

509
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,590
arrange 100 capture it doesn't matter

510
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,170
because the copter only listen to the

511
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,580
information that are broadcasted in the

512
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,980
air and calculate its own position but

513
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,820
yeah we have a more constraint of how

514
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,320
you can use it you really have to rig

515
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,720
the room you have to put anchors all

516
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:56,880
around your your space so the the system

517
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,130
we did out of this radio what we call

518
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,000
the local positioning system is based on

519
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,620
the DVM 1000 we intend it as open source

520
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,080
local position system for robotic any

521
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,690
kind of robotic since we are making a

522
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,000
flying platform we start with that so

523
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,710
that's our focus currently to make it

524
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,350
work as well as possible with the crazy

525
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,700
fly but we don't forget all the robotic

526
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,680
and we intended we intend to make it

527
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,260
useful for anyone that wants to

528
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,370
locate something in real time we've made

529
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,150
two piece of harbor for this system one

530
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,520
is what we call the note that's our

531
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,490
anchor that we have here the reason why

532
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,010
we don't call it anchor is that it's

533
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,750
basically an ultra band radio with a

534
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,930
processor and open source firmware so it

535
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,520
could be used as a tag it could be used

536
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,560
as a sniffer it's really nice as debug

537
00:24:52,560 --> 00:25:04,020
tool as well so yep and and the second

538
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,870
piece of hardware is is a deck for the

539
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,570
crazy fly so this is just a radio

540
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,360
connected to the CPU to crucify the

541
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,660
crazy fly is calculating its position

542
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,660
using using its main CPU using the femur

543
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,000
and and yeah all ranging all control is

544
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,400
implemented by the crazy fly sir so to

545
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
to range we need to make some femur

546
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,810
obviously for the crazy fly for the

547
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,180
anchor right now we have to well engine

548
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,950
working we consider it stable it's

549
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,880
working very well TDI we consider a very

550
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,750
experimental

551
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,100
we had it working we had flown five

552
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,130
copter in our lab it tends to do strange

553
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,480
things every now and then so that's

554
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
still in progress it's published oh it's

555
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,470
all open source so if anyone wants to

556
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:04,080
poke in it but we also discovered that

557
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,330
there is I mean we knew about it but we

558
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,070
discovered it even more that there is

559
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,690
more than just ranging in to making

560
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,630
local Positioning System one of these

561
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,540
the very important piece was sense of

562
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,030
fusion algorithm so we use a common

563
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,030
feature and the reason is that the

564
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,560
measurement you get from the system are

565
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,130
very noisy we've been flying with them

566
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,380
warmly men directly but you get very in

567
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,480
stable flight and it's not very nice to

568
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,540
look at it's not very useful so but

569
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,450
luckily we have inertial sensor in the

570
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,310
crazy flight that's how it flies so we

571
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,410
can use this inertial sensor to get an

572
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,380
idea on how

573
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,160
we're moving in short period of time

574
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,419
this national measurement we tend to

575
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:48,340
drift very quickly you can get a couple

576
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,220
of seconds of it and then you will your

577
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,820
estimated position we drift way too much

578
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,270
compared to your real position so what

579
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,000
the sensor fusion algorithm will do is

580
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,750
that it refuses to measurement inertial

581
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,070
measurement which are very good for

582
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,840
short-term but we tend to do it in long

583
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,419
term we'll try it by measurement which

584
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,840
are very stable over long term you can

585
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,159
integrate them and you will give you

586
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,900
will get pretty good measurement that's

587
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,340
not going to drift but in short terms

588
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,840
are almost useless because they are very

589
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,140
noisy and this has helped us to get much

590
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,150
better performance and we I also

591
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,130
discovered that a lot of work was needed

592
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,360
in trajectory control

593
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,640
evanka is not good enough to just let

594
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,130
the capture be here and just move by

595
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,159
moving the setpoint you need you need to

596
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,039
do it cleverly and you need to make it

597
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,900
follow trajectory so that has been

598
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,059
developed a lot recently as well and it

599
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,360
increased a lot smoothness of the flight

600
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,220
and how it behaves the performance

601
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:01,230
monitoring software wise so on the PC we

602
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,120
we've started implementing system with

603
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,700
Ross was is a robotic operating system

604
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,289
it's not an operating system it's a

605
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,750
framework it's a robotic framework that

606
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,000
is used by a lot of researcher around

607
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,950
the world in robotics and that gives you

608
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,990
a lot of basic pieces to work with

609
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,090
robotic like 3d visual visualizer and

610
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,730
debug tools so was really nice to work

611
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,590
with and it fits also our first target

612
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,480
which are researchers in robotic but we

613
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,730
are currently working at supporting the

614
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,220
system with a crazy fly Lib that already

615
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,990
exists we already have a byte on labor

616
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,669
and Python client controls a crazy fly

617
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:39,880
and this will allow to set up the system

618
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,650
much more easily and then you don't need

619
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,500
to have I mean Ross needs a specific

620
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,350
version of Ubuntu and it very hard to

621
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,380
get to get around it and to learn how to

622
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,290
use it so we intend to make it easier to

623
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,049
use

624
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,970
and also we intend to make it easier to

625
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,450
set up here we had to be very careful

626
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,789
about where we put the the anchors and

627
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,710
carefully measuring their position it

628
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,090
would be nice if we could just push a

629
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,820
button in everything is set up and all

630
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,590
the anchors know where they are after

631
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,260
they are ranging radios so they could

632
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:21,070
find their own position as well so we've

633
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,929
been releasing the system about six

634
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,700
months ago in what we call early access

635
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,760
which means that we tested the hardware

636
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,440
but the software was very very much

637
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,679
working progress people have been

638
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,779
getting it anyway starting to work with

639
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:35,320
it

640
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,269
universities and industries have been

641
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:40,299
using it to do research and tech demo

642
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:45,010
and this kind of things we also had low

643
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,320
interest by tech artists like to do

644
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,320
nitro or to yeah using to do shows

645
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,690
marginally that were a bit we knew there

646
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,190
was a need but we were livid surprised

647
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,750
about the amount of people that would

648
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,330
like to have a flying platform to do

649
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,120
shows so that would be a lot of fun as

650
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,559
 to see that coming and yes we are

651
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,169
Yahoo always a lot of ideas are was lost

652
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:13,750
software that needs to be done Marco

653
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,190
tempest it's a tech illusionist it's

654
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,679
been he's been making a blender

655
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,220
choreography plugin for blender plugin

656
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,919
for making choreography for fine

657
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:28,960
platform so basically micrographia

658
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,490
expert CSV and then you have the

659
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,320
playback tool which will be a swarm

660
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,899
management software it's nice name for

661
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,860
it to broadcast this to your copter and

662
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,750
follow the cog Rafi you have setup and

663
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,019
also we as I said working a lot of on

664
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,600
eating's set up like her automatic

665
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,059
tournament automatic and composition

666
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,330
measurements yes and to support general

667
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,010
more general robotic we're planning of

668
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,740
making a small tag with a new so yeah

669
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,450
basically a trace fly without the wing

670
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,909
without the 2.4 gigahertz radio but we

671
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,410
do try band radio that you could

672
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,170
hook up your existing robot and get XYZ

673
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,670
or even GPS like cell data if you if you

674
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,620
would like to retrieve it on an existing

675
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,190
robot so that's some things we are we're

676
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,150
looking at for the future and so yeah

677
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,620
I'm personally very interested by that

678
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,590
the this system will will allow more

679
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,690
University more research lab more people

680
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,750
to access local positioning because it

681
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,570
is ten to one at times less expensive

682
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,290
than these motion capture systems that

683
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,880
were state-of-the-art for doing this

684
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,770
kind of research so far it's less

685
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,210
precise but it's good enough for a lot

686
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,150
of use case but it's still out of reach

687
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,850
for hobbyist hackers I mean it's still a

688
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,910
bit on the expensive side but all the

689
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,440
software has been developed all the

690
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,480
sense of future and trajectory control

691
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,060
all that will allow this attempt to work

692
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,180
much better with sense of fusion we can

693
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,130
lose one second of image and it still

694
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,340
flies so all this camera based webcam

695
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,010
base will be able to work much much

696
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,600
better now that we have all the software

697
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,580
in place and that we've kind of

698
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,170
state-of-the-art algorithms in the crazy

699
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,390
fly so I'm hoping that coming back at

700
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,210
that and allowing anyone to to do

701
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,510
autonomous flight with the crazy fly

702
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,870
without having to have set up a

703
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,760
localization system at home so that's

704
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,840
the dangerous part

705
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:56,770
oh yeah thank you how is our chief yeah

706
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:02,410
that's not gonna work out so yeah that's

707
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,230
a wanted position of the anchors so we

708
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,630
have six and curse two here two here and

709
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,370
two on the front so it's kind of prison

710
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,200
and that's what our normal plant look

711
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,490
like so we are not GUI people so what

712
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,110
I'm doing is that I'm studying the crazy

713
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,090
5 facing X we have X Y and that Z it's

714
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,740
important because it has to know it's

715
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,020
issue orientation it can it can correct

716
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,840
its orientation with the sensor fusion

717
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,560
algorithm but it you need a good initial

718
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:47,879
orientation and yes I need connected

719
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,060
here I don't know if you see yeah a

720
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,820
little bit yeah ice was meant receiver

721
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,350
for development we have this lock

722
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,090
subsystem that allows to log a lot of

723
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,310
values from the crazy fly and that is

724
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,040
the distance to the anchor so if I move

725
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,710
around for example that's a bad one

726
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,100
the red one here is gonna know it's a

727
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,170
pink one that's going low and we also

728
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,850
see some outliers so that's a distance

729
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,760
to all the anchor I have set up in my

730
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,380
system so last week we've had at a

731
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,830
position hold so if I press this button

732
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,679
yes so now it's trying to keep it for

733
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,199
the its velocity so it's some kind of

734
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,060
velocity control there is some drift due

735
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,650
to a bag in the common feature but

736
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,449
basically I can control the velocity of

737
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,340
the platform and I can make it move at

738
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:58,980
constant velocity and just break but so

739
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,570
that's what we can do so far with our

740
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,590
client still work in progress but so

741
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,590
with Ross that we've been using for much

742
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,200
longer for this system that doesn't seem

743
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
to work oh yeah I know

744
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,140
that is so you can only guess you can

745
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,109
see but yes here I have a 3d

746
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,810
presentation of my space and we can see

747
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,290
the crazy fly that is this this axis in

748
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,800
in in the middle so I can just move my

749
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,500
setpoint takeoff and

750
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,509
[Applause]

751
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
yeah I'm not completely getting used to

752
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,190
it's very nice so that has been working

753
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,450
for months now and now I can try to show

754
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:27,549
what has been working for days we had a

755
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,950
lot of contact recently with University

756
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,249
ETH Zurich my camera officer has been

757
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:34,749
doing a lot of algorithms he has been

758
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,729
doing the Karen theater and recently has

759
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:41,709
been making nonlinear controller which

760
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:45,479
is apparently a much better offer and

761
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:49,599
we've had student Marcos grief here from

762
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,400
Lumiere still has been doing a

763
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,009
trajectory planning so the idea is that

764
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:57,670
here I had a set point and I could move

765
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,900
the set point around that we've been

766
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,759
trying for example to make circle

767
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:03,190
behaves very badly because cutter gets

768
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,890
late then tries to catch up then it's

769
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,140
too early and then it stops and you get

770
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,150
a very very bad trajectory what we are

771
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,729
doing here instead is that we pre

772
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:19,089
calculate velocity and position and

773
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:21,789
acceleration and we feed that to the

774
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:24,190
platform so we tell the crazy fly what

775
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,809
velocity what acceleration it should

776
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:30,069
which to follow the trajectory and this

777
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,380
should result in much better trajectory

778
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:38,880
control 8 oh yeah and I

779
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,880
yes this is what we're supposed to do so

780
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,560
yes very briefly we have an ellipse then

781
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,140
we which should go back and forth and

782
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,120
then we should have a spiral so let's

783
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:15,040
try 30 ellipse

784
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:55,150
[Applause]

785
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:05,530
yes power was cool 82 times yet

786
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,840
that's all I think so

787
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:25,200
[Applause]

788
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,800
my CJ got what yes

789
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,890
yes we are that's a point so the

790
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,740
question is that since we're using radio

791
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,140
is a what about directionality of the

792
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:07,520
antennas but yes we're using the decal

793
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,619
if not you here that uses cheap antenna

794
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:13,550
and yes there there is a there is some

795
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,589
effect of directionality so if I would

796
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:23,259
share it if I would make it turn

797
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:39,000
awesome okay so if I will make it turn

798
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,400
it starts this control is awesome

799
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,470
because it managed to keep its its

800
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,710
stability then if you do very like I

801
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,050
have not been able to crush it yet but

802
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,780
anyway okay having too much fun but

803
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,970
anyway the keys yeah we get I attribute

804
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,620
that to directionality of the antenna I

805
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,220
think we we are not turning on the same

806
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,410
point because we get the yeah we get

807
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,660
different position because of just

808
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,000
turning so that I guess it's things that

809
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,650
you might be able to account for if you

810
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,030
know if you know your system and you

811
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,050
calibrate for it it's just a single

812
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,540
receiver single antenna and this antenna

813
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,460
will have different propagation delay

814
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,820
depending of we have it small errors

815
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,540
depending of where signal comes from say

816
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,660
I could yeah

817
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,370
the ia has to pass upon via could have

818
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,870
an effect when the signal has to pass

819
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:55,020
through the motors for example yeah

820
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:07,380
yes yes so the question is that about

821
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,000
the accuracy we expect plus minus 10

822
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,050
centimeter of 3d accuracy it has been

823
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,820
done but I'm not sure about the result

824
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:34,140
exactly so it's in the other it has been

825
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,640
done with daikon system it's in the

826
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,280
order 10 centimeters XY we have a little

827
00:42:38,280 --> 00:43:00,180
bit more time we said we have been

828
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,000
starting selling this setup so

829
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,280
everything the radio's cutter and the

830
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,750
system four thousand euros so that's

831
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,270
yeah so that's why yeah that's why I

832
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,920
mean it's it's very affordable for

833
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,590
universities for hobbies is a little bit

834
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,810
steep so that's why I have some interest

835
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,800
also making it work with the webcam in

836
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,220
surrogate

837
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:42,750
yes if you want to easily source so

838
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,630
cheap it is the one I know that there is

839
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,490
also cheap available that have been used

840
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,829
very Gianna standard and they are not so

841
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:50,820
widespread

842
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,410
it's not so easy to source

843
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:05,348
[Applause]
