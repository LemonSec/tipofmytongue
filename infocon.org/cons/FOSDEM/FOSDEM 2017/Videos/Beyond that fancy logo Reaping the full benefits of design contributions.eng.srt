1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,990
for Berlin Glenn bars talking about

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,740
beyond the fancy logo well thank you

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,360
very much for coming to this talk about

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,960
design beyond fancy logos this is mainly

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,660
a talk for developers so all the

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,070
designers in the room

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,320
I know the people I hope you can bear

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,570
with me I hope this framing will send a

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,900
message across my name whoops

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,019
my name is Berlin and I behind software

11
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:37,220
for a living now the sign is not

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,960
designing software is not just a single

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,470
thing it is a set of activities and this

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,659
are they you need to explore the users

15
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,549
needs their problems and the complex

16
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,170
then the challengers they're just

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,850
shuffle you have to produce the content

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,790
in that software decide on the structure

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,920
and behavior determining the navigation

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,540
and the interface components I'm the

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,489
same how the interface looks like it's

22
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,489
layout on graphic design this owners are

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,430
not a single thing either they are also

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,150
a set a set of rails and this are they

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,210
usually searcher a content editor

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,260
information architect interaction

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,900
designer and visual designer but some

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,580
people may tell you all there are things

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,380
missing from that list you may go

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,870
missing things like UX person on

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,210
designer strategist and service

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,460
designers and I'm going to say yeah sure

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,530
but I think that this list is probably a

34
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,360
good compromise between what actually

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,760
happens when you make software and they

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,730
design industry and now this

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,220
important to highlight that this is not

38
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,880
people

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,820
these are roles and these roles can be

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,550
performed or played by one person a

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,700
single person or a few people for

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,250
example in Melbourne job I'll play these

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,520
roles the role of usual researcher

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,050
information architect an interaction

45
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,040
designer now this is how they design

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,860
activities map to roles right this is

47
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,299
what each of those people do

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,100
um now one of the things that caught my

49
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,110
attention when I first started working

50
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,510
in open source out five years ago was

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,010
that a lot of the designers that were

52
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,950
involved spent most of their time as

53
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,100
were playing one of the roles and only

54
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,620
one of them and that role was visual

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,640
design um this was five years ago today

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,420
the situation hasn't changed this is

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,580
still pretty much the same so designers

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,230
and open-source are spending the bulk of

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,450
their time looking into how interface

60
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,850
looks like the layout and that the

61
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,080
graphic design the question is the

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,990
question is where I'm free and open

63
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,180
source projects paying attention to the

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,640
users the content is structured the

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,110
navigation in the de haber for a

66
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,410
software why are you looking to be known

67
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,250
visual aspects of software design and at

68
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,930
this point my tell me Overland that's

69
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,510
not true we do we will pay attention to

70
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,830
all those things and I will reply I know

71
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,890
we don't and you be said to me oh yes we

72
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,350
do and I would say no we don't and I

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,690
like this until the end of time and I

74
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,440
need to break the tie I need to provide

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,750
you with evidence I need to prove to you

76
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,120
that what I'm saying is true and to find

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,500
that evidence I am when I looked at the

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,230
open source design jobs word so this is

79
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,440
a place where open-source software

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,690
projects that need the sign help can

81
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,570
submit a form like this they fill up

82
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,030
this form if they want or they need

83
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,490
design help and then that form is

84
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,400
published in a website and so designers

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,390
are going to contribute to open source

86
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,000
can find these requests and they can

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,180
actually help on contributes and so

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,050
that's where I looked at free and open

89
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,610
source software projects who are paying

90
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,340
equal attention to all design activities

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,950
their hypothesis would be that we should

92
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,980
respect similar number of jobs submitted

93
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,890
for all the design rules but instance

94
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,070
was actually happening

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,730
let's see so between several 2015 when

96
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,860
we launched the jobs world and January

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,530
2017 we received 61 jobs I took those

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,770
jobs and I looked at the descriptions

99
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,500
and the titles and I mapped them to the

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,970
different design rules that I showed you

101
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,980
before and what I found first of all is

102
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,080
that six of those jobs were actually for

103
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,820
front-end developers now freedom

104
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,680
development is not one of the roles that

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,350
I listed before so I took those out that

106
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,170
left us with 55 desiring jobs

107
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,810
well there's 55 38 69 % we're very and

108
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,320
very clearly and unequivocally asking

109
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,670
for visual design rule I'm only 14 25% I

110
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,170
couldn't work out what they were asking

111
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,930
for and this was because either they

112
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,750
were being proposed for evade like this

113
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,550
job that was being really open and we

114
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,400
can create a position to fit your skills

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,930
and to fit your interests which is

116
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,270
really nice well because they were

117
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,700
sending very confusing signals like this

118
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,430
job that says royal usability tags

119
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,070
interface design branding on logo now

120
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,590
usability is the realm of the user

121
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,870
research role but interface design

122
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,180
branding a logo are mostly the realm of

123
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,010
the visual design role so the

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,620
description didn't give me any hints so

125
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,930
that work out what they were asking for

126
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,760
in this case three jobs five percent

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,970
where clearly and unequivocally asking

128
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,820
for no visual aspects for non-visual

129
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,530
rules of design I also looked at the

130
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,960
kind of language people used in the job

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,300
titles and the job descriptions and I

132
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,380
found at 13 instances of no visual

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,500
design languages and design language

134
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,690
things like you civility information

135
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,660
architecture human-computer interaction

136
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,090
user research you suggesting this kind

137
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,840
of thing 13 instances but they were only

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,050
they appear only in six jobs and in fact

139
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,900
one job was responsible

140
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,060
for more than half of them by contrast

141
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,630
33 jobs of the 55 included the word logo

142
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,300
then I also looked at the design titles

143
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,650
people list so 27 jobs of the 55 were

144
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,020
referring to job title reusing the job

145
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,480
title that clearly refers to the visual

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,610
design role seems like leather designer

147
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,400
icon designer brand designer graphic

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,670
visual designer one job mentioned I'm a

149
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,250
visual design thought oh man Joe asked

150
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,950
for an entire interaction designer wrong

151
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,560
jobs asked for a user researcher a

152
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,350
Content professional or an information

153
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,210
architect so we look at the jobs and we

154
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,630
accept that those jobs are a fair

155
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,850
representation of what is happening in

156
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,010
design in the world of free and open

157
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,130
source software we must conclude that no

158
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,520
we will not pay attention to the non

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,230
visual aspects of design we are not

160
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,930
paying attention to the user to the

161
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,050
users to the content to the structure to

162
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,620
the behavior of our software it turns

163
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,950
out from this data the free and open

164
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,300
source software projects are mainly

165
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
local the mainly worrying about the way

166
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,010
they look like I'm very particularly

167
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,790
about 10 logos so if free and open

168
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,790
source approaches where a person they

169
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,850
will come across a thing now it's free

170
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,890
and open-source software really like

171
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,660
Justin Bieber ok me Western whatever

172
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,840
absolutely not right other things but

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
we're definitely not failed so why why

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,010
is this happening well I'm free and open

175
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,750
source software projects not investing

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,630
any effort in the non visual aspects of

177
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,230
design well tenesmus

178
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,570
I have no idea

179
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,270
and the more think about this the harder

180
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,640
is to come up with a satisfying answer

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,650
to this question I think like our

182
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,780
complex questions in this world it's a

183
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,690
combination of things and as such I

184
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,340
think it is the responsibility of this

185
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,500
community in the room to actually come

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,420
up with an answer however I suspect that

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,880
the answer to this question is somehow

188
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,980
connected to the answer to another

189
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,630
question why why should we invest on

190
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,210
those known visual aspects of design in

191
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,180
the first place why should we spend time

192
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,160
understanding our users and thinking

193
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,750
about the content the structure and

194
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,800
their behavior far suffer so I think I

195
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,620
think I might be able to answer this

196
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,330
question and that's what I'm trying to

197
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,310
do today in the rest of the time I have

198
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,030
now when I answer the question I'm not

199
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,790
going to talk to you about their return

200
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,590
from their own investment in the sign

201
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,220
all about stock prices or adoption rate

202
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,500
or engagement metrics that's the kind of

203
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,080
stuff that designers in the commercial

204
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,870
civil world are Clinton used to justify

205
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,180
to answer the question - why should we

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,890
invest in the non visual aspects of

207
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,230
design but I think they do not

208
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,000
necessarily translate well to the

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,290
context that free and open source

210
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,790
software so we're going to have to come

211
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,100
up with our own answers and the answer

212
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm going to use today it's actually a

213
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,400
little story I'm gonna tell you a story

214
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,790
and this thing it's about a logo but it

215
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,130
has absolutely nothing to do it suffer

216
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,040
it has to do with yoga say to make sure

217
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,470
that I came back from India I spent

218
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,780
there almost four months and I spent

219
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,420
most of the time in a small time in the

220
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,880
south of the country called Mysore and

221
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,340
the reason why I bothered to go to that

222
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,650
place is to study there than this very

223
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,320
very famous school the astanga-yoga

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,600
Elias school that was founded by

225
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,950
Pattabhi Jois now potami Wales arm dial

226
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,130
passed away in 2009 his family now runs

227
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,150
the show and

228
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,700
may tell you they are doing really well

229
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,780
for themselves

230
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,380
the school is incredibly expensive it's

231
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,160
absolutely full

232
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,960
and they're also diversifying their

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,850
business into like new lines they're

234
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,010
entering into new lines of business for

235
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,830
example the harvest started to sell yoga

236
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,110
apparel so they sell things like this

237
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,890
shirt

238
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,620
yoga box they even sell yoga mugs

239
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,760
whatever that is and and as you sell

240
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,430
these things they are cotton rugs you

241
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,470
see are standing is a particularly

242
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,830
sweaty practice you sweat an awful lot

243
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,320
so if you practice on a stander Martin

244
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,470
robbery once it gets really slippery so

245
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,420
then to stop you from sleeping on your

246
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,970
own sweat which is just disgusting

247
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,370
you put something like this on top and

248
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,710
these things are very thick they are

249
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,450
made of cotton and be like a thick towel

250
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,490
right so you put that on top of this

251
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,820
Thunder kind of robbery Matt Joyce

252
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,880
family created this little side business

253
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,150
they asked one of their students one of

254
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,710
the yoga students who happened to be a

255
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,470
visual designer to make them a logo and

256
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,360
the visual designer came up with this

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,950
truth inspirations from something called

258
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,440
the trip Andhra the trip india that this

259
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
man has on his forehead is a sacred

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,660
symbol of a branch of hinduism that the

261
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,550
joyce family happens to belong to and

262
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,290
the founder the patriarch of the family

263
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,780
Pattabhi Jois often wore that symbol on

264
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,000
his forehead so the joyce family was

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,980
delighted with the logo being lifted

266
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,200
because it has the cut visually was

267
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,120
really appealing they referred to the

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,770
Indian tradition - the Hindu tradition

269
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,930
unto their own tradition as a family

270
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,430
that belongs to this particular branch

271
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,840
of Hinduism

272
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,020
so they just got really excited and they

273
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,360
took this logo the printing labels and

274
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,980
they proceeded to stitch the labels to

275
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,020
be stuff they sell to make t-shirts

276
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,410
there but that's not the mugs but also

277
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,220
to the works to those cotton rods you

278
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,330
can see the logo stitched to the rugs

279
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,420
only when students started to turn up

280
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,520
with these rocks to practice they

281
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,010
realize

282
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,370
they had a little problem basically

283
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,500
students were stepping on the roads and

284
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,230
in doing so they were stepping on the

285
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,050
Lego and in doing so they were stepping

286
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,550
on the sacred symbol that rip Andhra now

287
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,990
in humanism fit I'll consider thirty ana

288
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,720
stepping on a sacred symbol is one of

289
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,440
the most offensive things anybody can do

290
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,640
and here you have hundreds of yoga

291
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,160
students stamping insulting the sacred

292
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,440
symbol which in the context of these

293
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,660
family and Hinduism was incredibly

294
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,830
important so this point you may be

295
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,840
wondering why the fastest way to telling

296
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,710
us this story because this is exactly

297
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,400
what happens when you do visual design

298
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,860
only when we make decisions based

299
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,270
exclusively on visual reasons without

300
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,670
considering anything else because

301
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,240
removing no visual design effectively

302
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,450
removes user centered design from the

303
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,410
project people who think major software

304
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,930
from the perspective of the people who

305
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,620
use it yes many of the people who are

306
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,350
skilled at understanding your users and

307
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,560
are splitting problems before you build

308
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,680
your features your remaining the people

309
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,230
who will have been able to tell you that

310
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,820
putting the sacred through pond'rous

311
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,180
syndrome a single all my work on a yoga

312
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,089
rod was actually a really bad idea

313
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,230
future center design helps us to spot

314
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,520
problems before we build this software

315
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,800
because what makes this interment well

316
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,530
because once you have a stitched the

317
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,110
label to the rock once you've made a

318
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,860
mistake the only solution is forcing a

319
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,800
workaround upon your users in this case

320
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,460
the donor school said you have to repave

321
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,370
the label

322
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,230
you're right otherwise you will not be

323
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,640
allowed in now the graves family

324
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,050
commands a lot of respect from the

325
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,150
students and everybody agreed to do so

326
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,020
but guess what we do not command the

327
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,760
same respect and authority over our

328
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,500
users say I'm facing workarounds forcing

329
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,090
the currents upon our users to

330
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,390
compensate for our missions and

331
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,570
misunderstandings simply does not work

332
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,270
users will vote with their feet and if

333
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,980
our software doesn't work for them or

334
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,780
forces them to do things that feel

335
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,210
unnatural or unconvenient they will

336
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,390
simply abandon our software that's it

337
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,940
they will do something else so this is

338
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,580
why it's so important that we think

339
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,390
about the non visual aspects of design

340
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,490
because user centered design engages

341
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,270
users of software as equal partners not

342
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,730
just of people who are passive elements

343
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,950
that receive the technology and with the

344
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,010
technology we produce it engages users

345
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,200
as equal partners in the process of

346
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,630
making software and if a base through

347
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,690
partnership without a true shift to user

348
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,600
centered design processes free and open

349
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,700
source software will never see

350
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,280
widespread adoption and we will not

351
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,950
stand a chance against commercial

352
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,760
software now we know the building

353
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,710
software from our user centered

354
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,350
perspective it's very very difficult I

355
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,070
do that for a living it's bloody hard

356
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,450
the projects are me to do it alone

357
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,520
that's what the open source design

358
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,880
initiative is for we are willing to help

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,089
so if you are a developer who first

360
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,220
introduced user Center practices in the

361
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,500
project or you're a visual designer who

362
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,480
wants to contribute did you try to blow

363
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,640
making the others or color palettes

364
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,660
game patch we want to hear from you

365
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,390
thank you very much

366
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,630
[Applause]

367
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,220
oh please likes a bear and please give

368
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,030
feedback on the talk if you can and

369
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,050
hopefully we have five minutes for

370
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:47,560
questions who said I don't know you guys

371
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,810
okay that is a really good question so

372
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,430
maybe this is an action we need to take

373
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,550
we need to make sure that our jobs for

374
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,130
communicates the type of design rules

375
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,130
that you can actually request through it

376
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,750
that's an excellent piece of feedback

377
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,120
thank you very much user centered design

378
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,560
process at work ladies

379
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,190
yeah this is not a simple this is not

380
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,870
simple reason why is not black or white

381
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,660
obviously I think both parts every part

382
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,400
involved in opens were separate somehow

383
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,530
responsible for the fact that design is

384
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,600
simply been understood as the visual

385
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,490
aspects and I think there is a role for

386
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,070
Education II here in this talk it's kind

387
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,310
of part of that I guess and but yeah I

388
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,380
think there needs to be a willing for

389
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,880
things to change there needs to be a

390
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,730
willingness for parts and on all the

391
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,810
sites and all the people that are

392
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,760
participating in and contributing to

393
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,470
free and open-source software projects

394
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,480
to make this change to make this true

395
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,050
shift to to user Center practices does

396
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:52,630
that answer your question open to

397
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,580
designs the time itself I don't know

398
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,300
Victoria

399
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,690
Thanks can we take one more question

400
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,590
absolutely these letters are incredibly

401
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,780
important but not because his ramen is

402
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,580
because they reinforce the identity of a

403
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,610
project between the contributors

404
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,940
themselves however Legos by themselves

405
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,669
are meaningless so that's what they're

406
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,429
trying to say right I'm not trying to

407
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:14,260
dismiss anybody here I think you guys

408
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,270
focusing on logos do an incredibly

409
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,850
important job the problem is that that

410
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,260
is not the only aspect of design I'm

411
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,030
going to bring awareness to the elements

412
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,559
so thanks

413
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,120
yeah this narrow understanding of bazaar

414
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,250
in us just a visual aspects as usability

415
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,620
or user engaging with users not being

416
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,918
part of it

417
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,380
[Applause]
