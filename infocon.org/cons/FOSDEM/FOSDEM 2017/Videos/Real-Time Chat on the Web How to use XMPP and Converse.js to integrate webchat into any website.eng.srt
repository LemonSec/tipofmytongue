1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,790
well yeah hello

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,930
welcome everybody to the talk real-time

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,830
chat on the web

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,789
I'm JC the Dutch people will be able to

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,300
pronounce my name easy its young Karl so

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,949
this is about real-time chat using ex

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,839
EPP and JavaScript library called

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,659
converse J's not going to really go much

9
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,050
into what XMPP is I don't have a lot of

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,810
time quite a few slides to show but just

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,610
there's a quick overview it stands for

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,380
the extensible message and presence

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,360
protocol which kind of explains quite a

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,280
lot of what it's about was originally

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,780
known as jabber and used for instant

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,170
messaging also for signaling for example

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,580
video KO massage conferencing or file

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,360
sharing or also likely using for in

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,229
Internet of Things applications for

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,339
interoperability between different

21
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,860
devices or to be able to communicate

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,960
with your device your IOT devices via

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,020
via chat conversations and I gave it

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,469
talk about XMPP about three years ago at

25
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:21,090
a phone conference kind of introductory

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,530
talk where I go much more in detail

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,359
about about it so there's a link below

28
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,479
this slides are live over there converse

29
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,229
gesture org for CH less slides FOSDEM 27

30
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:42,960
with a dash index.html no not currently

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
so yeah one of the first things you'll

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,600
recognize when you're trying to

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,149
integrate xpp chat into a website is

34
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,999
that XP is a fundamentally different

35
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,770
protocol and it expects you to have a

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,289
TCP socket connection to a port that's

37
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,139
different than and your your webserver

38
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,409
ports and the browser's sandboxing

39
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,869
doesn't allow for these TCP connections

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,250
and doesn't have any PI's api's for it

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,209
additionally the two protocols are

42
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,950
conceptually different so for example

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,400
HTTP is stateless

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,620
it's a request response based so you can

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,020
ever get anything from a from a HTTP

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,970
server that you didn't first in the

47
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,400
request for and it's also stateless

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,819
because any requests you send is

49
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,660
fundamentally independent from any

50
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,850
previous requests you send at least on

51
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,940
the protocol level and also generally

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,770
the connections are short-lived

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,550
so XMPP is stateful it's interactive and

54
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,530
bi-directional which what I mean by that

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,170
is you can at any single time receive

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,830
data from an XMPP server unannounced and

57
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,319
without having asked for it and

58
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,920
therefore also requires that Jenny is

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,390
dependent on a more long-running

60
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,760
connection so when we think about how to

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,280
integrate xvp into a web app I'm gonna

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,730
split it up into two a two areas or

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,769
domains what I call front-end

64
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,670
integration and back in integration here

65
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,489
I've just a little graph where graphic

66
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,489
where I show your web application web

67
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,540
browser and xvp server generally you

68
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,480
will have HTTP traffic between the web

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
browser and your web application or

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
maybe web socket now we're bringing an

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,350
XP server into the mix and it's possible

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,019
to have direct communication from your

73
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,209
web browser to the xbp server or I'll

74
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,540
explain how that happens bridging the

75
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,220
problems I mentioned just before of the

76
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,560
protocols being different conceptually

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,540
but you could also have communication

78
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,209
directly between the web application

79
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,739
which is running on a server somewhere

80
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,390
and xbp server and there might be

81
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,079
reasons why you want to do that

82
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,700
so starting with the front in

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,609
integration to bridge this problem of

84
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,730
the protocols being different you

85
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,500
basically have two things you can do you

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,190
can sort of speak tunnel XMPP through

87
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,478
HTTP or you can do a XMPP over WebSocket

88
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,740
and so the way you do the XMPP over HTTP

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,289
is through a technique called posh

90
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,820
stands for bi-directional streams over

91
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,060
synchronous HTTP it's not XMPP specific

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,280
but

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,810
that comes from the XMPP community it's

94
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,510
already since 2004 so it's really an

95
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,630
established way of doing things you do

96
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,040
get this by directionality in other

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,170
words you are able to receive data from

98
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,620
the server in this case a web server or

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,970
a Bosch connection so-called Bosch

100
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,110
connection manager and the way you do

101
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,820
this is through long polling and the way

102
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,990
long polling works is generally a web

103
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,520
server when it receives a request it

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,130
will serve you know for full through the

105
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,040
request and then quickly return response

106
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,080
with long polling what the web server

107
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
does is it holds on to the request and

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,470
doesn't immediately return a response

109
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,820
and it waits until asynchronously it

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,460
receives data that is worthwhile that

111
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,080
that make sense to return for example in

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,210
the context of instant messaging it

113
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,650
would hold on to the request and wait

114
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,810
until it has any instant messaging data

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,190
to return and then it will return a

116
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,310
response to the web client and

117
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,000
immediately the web client will make

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,810
another request and if you have a

119
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,080
timeout so maybe 30 60 seconds or so if

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,060
the timeout is reached the web server

121
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,540
will return Mt risk response and again

122
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,490
you know the web client immediately

123
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,900
makes a request and you can also have

124
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,030
multiple in parallel running request

125
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,790
responses like that as well so supports

126
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,380
session is that attachment and

127
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,710
resumption which is important because we

128
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,470
have this statelessness of the HTTP

129
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,840
protocol but you want to maintain your

130
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
xbp session across requests and also

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,140
across page loads so this is done with

132
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,160
session and request tokens that you kind

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,900
of have to send to the with each request

134
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,530
to maintain your session and it requires

135
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,970
a connection manager the connection

136
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,290
manager is like basically thing that

137
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,630
sits between the xbp server and the HTTP

138
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,210
client it speaks HTTP to the HTTP client

139
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,460
and expeed XMPP to the xpp server so

140
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,460
it's like a translating device for

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,700
translating service and it's built-in

142
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,530
with most except appease server so you

143
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,030
generally don't have to worry about it

144
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,810
unless you want to support many

145
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,000
different servers then you might have to

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,420
use a

147
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,250
the other technique is a WebSocket

148
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,380
advantage of it is that it has less

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,180
transport overhead you only have to

150
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,550
establish one connection per page load

151
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,530
you don't have to establish a new socket

152
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,270
connection for every request that you do

153
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,280
for example HTTP which can become

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,060
expensive if you have TLS connections

155
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,800
it's bi-directional and it's basically

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,870
emulating the TCP socket connection that

157
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,360
you would have with XMPP in normal

158
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,700
circumstances but at the application

159
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,970
level which the browser label and it

160
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,120
also has a quick session resumption so

161
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,470
if you reload the page you can just

162
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,590
quickly re-attach so to speak to your

163
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,490
existing session but that's in a XMPP

164
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,190
extension called zero one nine eight

165
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,110
stream management if you implement that

166
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,510
then you get that

167
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,740
so that's front end back in there's

168
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,380
basically three ways that you might

169
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,870
communicate between your web application

170
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,950
back-end your webs web app and XMPP

171
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,860
server the one would be to use posh

172
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,560
again that I've just explained another

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,850
one would be to kind of have some kind

174
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,400
of bolt in xvp client using a XMP

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,650
library where you it would have to be

176
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,340
then asynchronous right would have to

177
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,590
fulfill these requirements mentioned

178
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,160
earlier and a third way is to have HTTP

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,160
calls between your web application and

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,140
an XMPP server if the XMPP service

181
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,040
provides some kind of restful or Jason

182
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,140
HTTP API which a lot of them do so the

183
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,880
only reason why I know that people do

184
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,250
partial communication between a back-end

185
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,919
and XMP server is just for a technique

186
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,979
called pre binary where you want to log

187
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,799
in the user before the page loads so

188
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,770
that you can kind of have one session

189
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,110
the user can log into your CMS or

190
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,540
website or application and you do the

191
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,640
pre binding where it in the back and

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,260
create AB wishes next piece

193
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,980
XMPP session session so that the user

194
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,960
doesn't have to maintain

195
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,700
other set of credentials for Lexington P

196
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,290
server there's a drawback to that that

197
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,230
to this and that is that if you want to

198
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,300
do this you need to have the credentials

199
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,180
in plain text of the except easier

200
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,310
because you need to be able to log the

201
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,500
user in so there are other ways of doing

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,980
this that I think in many cases are

203
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,560
better you could for example do some

204
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,240
kind of token-based authentication where

205
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,400
you sign tokens with some kind of

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,350
private key and the expiry server

207
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,150
verifies that the token was signed with

208
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,330
the right key and also has the right

209
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,420
format you could use various forms of

210
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,630
external authentication whereby you hand

211
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,090
over authentication the XMPP server

212
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,680
hands over authentication to some kind

213
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,030
of external database or website so for

214
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,340
example you could let the XMPP server

215
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,590
orth indicate against your own website

216
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,920
so in that way the users credentials for

217
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
your website are the same credentials

218
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,640
for the XMPP server and they could also

219
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,850
if they have a mobile app that has xbp

220
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,590
they can use the website credentials to

221
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,840
log in there and have chat and not have

222
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,870
to worry about two sets of credentials

223
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,800
or you can have some kind of external

224
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,740
back in like LDAP sequel or so on so two

225
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,290
more reasons why you might want to share

226
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,750
data between your web application

227
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,920
back-end and XP server is you might have

228
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,420
already some kind of concept of let's

229
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,060
say conversations on your website where

230
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,740
you are creating conversations in some

231
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,350
kind of CMS or so on and now you want to

232
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,860
make these conversations real-time so in

233
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,590
that case you might want to keep hold of

234
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,410
this kind of concept of conversations in

235
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,050
your web application and then mirror it

236
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,950
or replicated to the XMPP server in this

237
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,970
case you really have to think about

238
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,680
atomicity in other words when you are

239
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,570
creating so-called conversation and you

240
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,190
have to correspondingly create a chat

241
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,010
room in your xbp client XP server excuse

242
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,620
me this has to be happen this has to

243
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,990
happen is one atomic as transaction so

244
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,160
that it cannot be split up because

245
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,090
otherwise you're going to have

246
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,030
situations eventually where the

247
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,610
does not mirror it correctly another

248
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,840
question you might have to ask ask

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,050
yourself is can where is the canonical

250
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,240
store if if you're having it mirrored

251
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,660
across to back ends you probably want

252
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,490
one of them to be like the truth and

253
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,260
eventually if something happens you need

254
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,900
to kind of regenerated data you have

255
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,180
this one where you can kind of push it

256
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,160
out back into for example the back end

257
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,570
is your canonical store and you push out

258
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,840
the data to the XMPP server another case

259
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,090
which is similar but not exactly is if

260
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,010
you want to just have communication

261
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,230
between the two services but you don't

262
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,730
want to store it on both of them so a

263
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,520
good example is let's say you have some

264
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
kind of social networking features

265
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
already in your website so you have some

266
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
kind of social graph or a context list

267
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,150
or whatever and you want to also present

268
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,030
this context list in the context of XMPP

269
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,650
or if your real-time chat application or

270
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,770
real-time chat part of your app that

271
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,840
would mean that you would want the XMPP

272
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,290
so-called contacts roster to have the

273
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,190
same data so you can tell the XMPP

274
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,890
server to fetch this data from your web

275
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,750
app and therefore proceeding except a

276
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,730
piece over for example there is a module

277
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,900
for that which met while the creator of

278
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,990
prosthetic wrote which I am I use and

279
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,060
yeah that's a good example of that then

280
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,760
coming to converse J's what is that it's

281
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,620
a chat application that runs in your

282
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,380
browser uses strophe J's which just

283
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,530
heard the jetty meet people also use for

284
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,440
their web app it you can use it as a

285
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,120
standalone application that converts

286
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,910
jstor org that's kind of what it looks

287
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,920
like that's also the web site if you

288
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,080
were to go there now you can log in if

289
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,370
you have an excipient you can also

290
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,240
register a new account and and and use

291
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,390
it there's also a mobile version I

292
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,850
wouldn't recommend using it for mobile

293
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,290
there are mobile apps that are way

294
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,420
better but if you are in a bind or for

295
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,830
whatever reason you can also go to the

296
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,240
mobile version of it and use it like

297
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,480
that

298
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,780
it's well it's translated very well

299
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,950
tested it supports

300
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,050
Bosh and WebSocket Bosh works very well

301
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,360
by the way and it's actually what I use

302
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,860
most of the time it can be integrated

303
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,950
into any website and mainly for three

304
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,470
reasons it's very customizable or

305
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,800
configurable so it has this link goes to

306
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,690
the config settings page of Converse

307
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,220
where you can see all the configuration

308
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,550
settings through this you can turn

309
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,720
things on and off where you can

310
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,610
configure how things work you can also

311
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,900
the features are all implemented as

312
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,060
plugins so you can take out any features

313
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,310
and create a new build of the JavaScript

314
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,890
but javascript build and therefore have

315
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,740
you know create your customized yourself

316
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,760
you can of course also write your own

317
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,940
plugins to add new features or to

318
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,400
customize it and if you don't want to

319
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,530
use plugins if you just want to use the

320
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,260
the full bold which is available via CDN

321
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,210
you can also just disable them through

322
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,520
white and black lists the code is there

323
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,110
but I haven't add tests and it's not

324
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,370
released so that's what I'm saying

325
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:33,000
coming soon so let me show why the or

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,190
let me show that this is possible this

327
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,670
is converse a is the website itself so

328
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,650
you can see it's like overlaid with that

329
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,120
of course makes it much easier to

330
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,820
integrate into a website because you can

331
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,010
have any kind of design or whatever and

332
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,480
you can just overlay these things of

333
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,830
course you can start it yourself as well

334
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,030
it's just HTML CSS here's a full-screen

335
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,930
version I'm working on that's the same

336
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,360
codebase it's just different CSS and a

337
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,130
small plug-in with a little bit of

338
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,220
JavaScript it's not completely finished

339
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,370
yet but it's getting there it's same one

340
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,310
here it is in in reddit I can actually

341
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:21,530
have it live as well so I made a little

342
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,020
chromium plug-in which just loads the

343
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,030
JavaScript files is - it's one

344
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,680
JavaScript file and once this file and

345
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,040
it loads it in any website and you just

346
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,270
didn't have chat so you know I

347
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,430
just gonna spam the summit chatroom here

348
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,530
it is running in reddit I also have it

349
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,170
and tweet tech it's basically any any

350
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,670
website here's a little example of a CSS

351
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,340
bug so generally you know there's little

352
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,510
things like that that you might want to

353
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,650
take a look at when you're integrating

354
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,010
it yeah so there's that what I also also

355
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,530
this these slides are a website here I

356
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,260
integrated into the slides as well this

357
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,120
is a so called embedded it's just as a

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,010
single chatroom its the chatroom is

359
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,510
called anonymous that's why it stays

360
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,040
anonymous there and you're also logging

361
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,710
in anonymously luckily nobody has put

362
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,680
anything inappropriate there and so it's

363
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,980
running in the slides this is open

364
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,010
source project I've gotten many bug bug

365
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,830
fixes and pool requests over the years

366
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,810
and I'm very grateful and thankful for

367
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,180
all of those I'm very happy to get more

368
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,640
people involved yeah this there's really

369
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,900
a lot to do here are all kinds of things

370
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,010
that one could work on I'm seriously

371
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,690
considering starting google Summer of

372
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,290
Code projects for Omaima encryption and

373
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,690
mix mix is like a new conversation

374
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,660
protocol that is in the pipeline it's

375
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,630
kind of basically being implemented now

376
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,720
and yeah also designers I don't know if

377
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,339
there's any any designers here but

378
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,630
there's really a lot that could be work

379
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,569
on and I'd be happy to work together

380
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,839
with other people more on this there are

381
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,500
also other software in a similar vein so

382
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,420
there's two other libraries for example

383
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,270
besides strophe which stands on Io and

384
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,400
xp for the web stanza iOS used in Oh

385
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,600
talk and in Kiowa Kiowa is a single page

386
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
app

387
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
I don't really I'm not going to go into

388
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,289
detail there but I linked to them you

389
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,019
can check them out and you're welcome to

390
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,850
compare all the different options and

391
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,820
their strengths and and weaknesses and

392
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,870
that's basically it

393
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,860
these are my details if I cannot answer

394
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,019
any questions now you're welcome to

395
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,639
reach out to me is my email address is

396
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,000
also my XMPP handle and I'm happy to to

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,740
answer any questions or to talk about

398
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,100
anything yeah any I don't have we have

399
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,340
time yeah so I also have a moment now

400
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:42,279
for questions if anybody has some xbp is

401
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,880
is a open standard standardized protocol

402
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,139
that's also federated so it allows you

403
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:52,960
you can run your own private XMPP server

404
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,090
and then you could create your own slack

405
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,570
kind of service one of the big

406
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,370
advantages of XMPP is that you can

407
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,159
connect it's like email so if I have my

408
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,019
X P P server and you have your XMPP

409
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,750
server or you using someone else's I can

410
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,539
send you a message so it's not siloed

411
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,429
like so so many of the commercial

412
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:13,870
offerings

413
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,769
besides that XE BP has certain ways of

414
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,750
it expects things to be done that like

415
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,600
certain concepts slack has helped to

416
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,299
kind of make people think anew about how

417
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,360
chat should work for example also with

418
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,220
mobile connections and so on the idea

419
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,169
that you are always in a conversation

420
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,149
and always online not online but you're

421
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:38,830
always part of a conversation is kind of

422
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,159
something that is relatively recent

423
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,049
before there was this idea like an IRC

424
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,850
or so that you join and then you're in

425
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,010
or you're not but you're not like a

426
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,389
member of a room even if you're not

427
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,210
online so that's why we're mix comes in

428
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,399
its mixes as partly I think a response

429
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:58,659
to to innovation that has happened

430
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:01,340
but it's so it's kind of like slack it's

431
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,580
just generally free and opensource

432
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:30,409
and doesn't lock people in yeah so like

433
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,510
because it's a communications protocol

434
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,820
you can also use it for example for

435
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,700
other kind of seconds of signaling so to

436
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,350
have the devices talk to one another or

437
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,620
to

438
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,060
[Music]

439
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:54,790
[Applause]
