1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
um GPL

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:10,400
enforcement or GPL compliance and with

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,650
the experience of doing that for 25

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,160
years

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,470
and I'm running really happy to

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,490
introduce you

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,890
Bradley Caan who's one of the very few

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,140
if not the only person on this planet

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,000
who has this experience of doing this

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,640
GPL work for 25 years so I'm all

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,220
thrilled to listen to what he has to say

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,350
give him a very warm welcome Bradley

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:43,100
come please so I think the most

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,750
important thing to remember about my

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,760
talk is not what I'm gonna say but how

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,100
important this event is this events run

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,800
by a community of volunteers it is the

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,660
most important free-software event in

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,699
the world every year it has the most

20
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,820
attendees and it is non-commercial

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,600
community oriented and fair and friendly

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,108
and

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,890
there are only three or four events like

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,450
that left in our community because

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,160
they've been taken over by other

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,920
interests and this is by far the largest

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,960
so that's the most important thing I

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,840
have to say you can only know my slides

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,710
are online

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,110
anything that's in blue is a link so

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,970
feel free to follow along and when you

32
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,470
get bored just click through the links

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,150
and read those instead I've done a lot

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,000
of talks about copyleft as most of you

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,729
probably know I see people out there who

36
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,450
have seen a lot of them I work for an

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,920
organization called the software freedom

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,619
Conservancy we do a lot of different

39
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,869
things we spend a lot of different time

40
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,759
on things that are not licensed

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,100
informatin forcement or anything to do

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,950
with licenses my colleague stayed up to

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,479
4:00 a.m. this time zoned to get a bunch

44
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,550
of logistics done for a conference for

45
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,410
one of our projects last night while I

46
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,560
was working on this talk I spent some of

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,910
the afternoon working on this talk but

48
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,690
also importing our donation system and

49
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,690
fixing it but people always want to hear

50
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,370
about copyleft so I tend to talk about

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,080
that more than any other topic that we

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,670
do I suppose you don't want to hear

53
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,370
about how our paypal imports Perl script

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,700
works

55
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,780
yes it's written in Perl I'm sorry so I

56
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,959
think most importantly free software

57
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,489
developers need to know the whole story

58
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,850
of what's going on there are a lot of

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,370
things happening in the politics of

60
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,560
copyleft and my colleague Karen Sandler

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,060
my work with keeps telling me not to use

62
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,920
the word politics but there are lots of

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,140
politics so I'm not the type of person

64
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,700
that's going to cover up what things

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,160
really are and most of you don't know

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,340
what is going on with those politics

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,049
fortunately because I work for a charity

68
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,570
not a company not a trade association I

69
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,549
have a tremendous amount of freedom it's

70
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,049
the best job I've ever had I hope to

71
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,190
retire from it someday and I have not

72
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,739
only the freedom but an obligation as an

73
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,570
employee of a charity to really tell you

74
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,190
what the real story is at least from our

75
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,130
point of view in fact Conservancy I

76
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,660
think is even more transparent than most

77
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,389
charities and we operate I think as the

78
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,579
most transparent organization in the

79
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,019
open source and free software community

80
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,139
by

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,090
those of you have seen my talks before

82
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,220
know that I like to put stuff about

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,580
philosophers up on my slides I like

84
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,160
first principles I like the idea of

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,240
applying the humanities to this world of

86
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,340
science I think interdisciplinary

87
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,100
thought is important I'm capable of

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,200
laughing at it as well but I really

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,240
cared about ideas and morality and right

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,530
and wrong and doing good in the world so

91
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,880
I want to start out by giving the brief

92
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,620
tale of how I ended up caring so much

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,320
about copyleft I went to what we call in

94
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,460
the u.s. a liberal arts university I was

95
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,680
primarily studying computer science but

96
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,410
we had excessive requirements some

97
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,988
thought in going to philosophy and

98
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,200
literature courses but I was a geek of

99
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,230
course and I had never owned my own

100
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,630
computer I know that sounds bizarre to

101
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,190
the younger people in the audience but

102
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,900
until I got to college I never on my

103
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,690
computer and my own computer so I wanted

104
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,310
to buy one so I bought something that

105
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,140
looked a lot like this I actually got it

106
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,880
from Sager I could not find any picture

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,460
of 1992 era Sager laptops so this is I

108
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,500
think it's a Shiba model but it looked a

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,220
lot like that

110
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,900
I couldn't find any personal pictures of

111
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,400
it well apparently I didn't like take

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,980
photos of my computer like I did with my

113
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,230
dogs now so there's not any photos of

114
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,870
that computer I don't think but I got it

115
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,230
and it was well known around campus one

116
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,180
of my literature professors whom I liked

117
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,190
I went back to see him in the early

118
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,070
2000s I had him for three classes I

119
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,360
didn't expect him to remember me he said

120
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,100
of course I remember you you were the

121
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,570
first person to ever bring a laptop to

122
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,070
one of my classes now they all bring

123
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,520
those things

124
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,909
and now I got it this way I didn't have

125
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:15,749
an internet access

126
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,909
you used to buy this magazine was called

127
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,069
the computer shopper it was giant it was

128
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,680
this thick it was like six dollars and

129
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,689
fifty cents which was a pretty expensive

130
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,389
magazine in 1992 and you'd page through

131
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,650
it and you look at all the computers for

132
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,509
sale and you'd use this thing called a

133
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,699
telephone and I'm not talking about like

134
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,139
that that device you have in your pocket

135
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,460
now this was a thing connected to a

136
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,560
twisted-pair line to a central office

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,509
that sort of stuff and you call him up a

138
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,949
new door a computer and they send it to

139
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,409
you now I had already been using UNIX I

140
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,020
had access to a UNIX system at work

141
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,889
unfortunately that point only access to

142
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,840
a VMS system at school but I knew UNIX

143
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,210
was the best operating system available

144
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,990
and I need to find one for my little

145
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,150
sager laptop there well X wasn't so

146
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,669
little it was like 35 pounds I don't

147
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,110
have a exercisin kilos it was it was

148
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,699
heavy that's why I think every laptop I

149
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,199
had is like I'm free rolling because

150
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,789
every laptop I've ever had is lighter

151
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,770
than that one ever since then so hey I

152
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,870
carried around 35 pounds around campus

153
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,330
what's the big deal so I started reading

154
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,069
this news group because I had Euston

155
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,960
access but I never access so I was

156
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,629
reading compo s MINIX and read this well

157
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,490
in what Usenet was called real-time it

158
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,509
was a few days after it was posted

159
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,250
because it took that long for the

160
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,779
message to get to you but a few days

161
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,000
after this posted I read it because I

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,529
was reading Campos mimics to see if I

163
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,719
could get mimics running on that sager

164
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:34,409
pc and then found out that hey this

165
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,939
linux thing might be coming along when I

166
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:38,039
get my sacred PC I can install this

167
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,680
Linux thing and one of the things that

168
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
was very interesting to me was that word

169
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,819
that's still very interesting to me

170
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,899
because for me software was going to be

171
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,310
a profession but it was also going to be

172
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,629
a hobby had already been a hobby for

173
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:54,180
many years and I like this idea of

174
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,000
writing something as a hobby because

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,319
hobby is for people who bought this

176
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,719
thing every month hobby is for people

177
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,310
who would buy a device like that and

178
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,589
carry it around a campus it was heavy I

179
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,569
to batteries for it too because that you

180
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,710
need to switch batteries in the middle

181
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,629
of a 45-minute class because you ran out

182
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,479
and the great thing that when I

183
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,029
downloaded the 30 floppies of SLS slack

184
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,879
we didn't exist yet when I installed

185
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,840
Linux for the first time

186
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,419
I actually was able to patch Linux I was

187
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,100
able to change things I changed Linux

188
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,090
and I should have submitted them

189
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,290
upstream I'd actually be a copyright

190
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,820
holder now and they wouldn't be able to

191
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,260
accuse me of not being a copyright

192
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,270
holder but I've never seen any my

193
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,580
patches upstream by the way that one of

194
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,860
the patches I made the the did you know

195
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,720
that there was no that there was the

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
fight over Nitin systemd but there was

197
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,650
no NIT system in the early Linux when

198
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,780
you hit control-alt-delete it literally

199
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,540
called halt in the source code I

200
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,070
commented that out so in case I hit

201
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,150
control-alt-delete I didn't want the

202
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,229
computer to halt

203
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,320
so I gots a patch right so I discovered

204
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,700
copyleft because of this I started using

205
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,740
free software and started using Emacs as

206
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,870
well and since all a copy of the GPL I

207
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,090
now this definition of copyleft didn't

208
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,620
exist at the time when I discovered it

209
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,570
but it's a really good definition so you

210
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,070
have the benefit of the years of people

211
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,960
honing this definition which originally

212
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,790
comes from what keep from Wikipedia and

213
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,490
now is on copyleft org but the most

214
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,110
important word I want to draw to your

215
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,130
attention is strategy copyleft is not a

216
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,949
principle it's a strategy it's not a

217
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,460
moral imperative as Kant might say it is

218
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,610
a method to achieve an important moral

219
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,130
imperative that's the moral imperative

220
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,250
from my point of view making sure that

221
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,130
every individual who has software on

222
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,690
their computer has the right to copy

223
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,940
modify distribute and install those

224
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,880
modifications on their laptop or

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
whatever Hardware they have and share

226
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,620
them with other people that's in my view

227
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,029
something that should be an inalienable

228
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,589
right I think it should be in the UN

229
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,040
Declaration of Human Rights in fact

230
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,690
copyleft on the other hand is not a

231
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,839
principle like that is it is a strategy

232
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,850
that we invented particularly Stallman

233
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,720
invented to help us get there to that

234
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,060
moral imperative help us reach that goal

235
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,830
so since it's only a strategy it's not a

236
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,480
principle you could throw away

237
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,670
strategies and make up new ones you

238
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,870
should be very careful about throwing my

239
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,310
principles particularly first principles

240
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,010
but we can ask the question of copyleft

241
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,290
is working at all people keep asking me

242
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,820
that over and over again in fact so I

243
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,529
have find myself answering it very often

244
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,990
I'm pretty sure the only way we can

245
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,620
answer it requires us to have access to

246
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,339
multiple

247
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,379
universe is one of which all the

248
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,910
software with free software was copy

249
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,889
lefted and all the software and the

250
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,110
other universe was non copy lefted if we

251
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,339
could look at those two parallel

252
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,860
universes we could figure out what the

253
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,699
better strategy was but even if this you

254
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,620
know the many worlds of quantum states

255
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,370
whatever that is is true I only know it

256
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,870
from science fiction I'm not actually I

257
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,399
didn't take any physics I was busy

258
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,050
taking literature and philosophy I think

259
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,889
we can't analyze the parallel universes

260
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,089
so we have to look at what we have

261
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:16,290
what's happened in the past and what

262
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,439
seems to be happening now and as we do

263
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,240
that there are two things that are

264
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,399
happening more and more these days it's

265
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,230
reached I think in our entire political

266
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,509
culture not just the free-software one

267
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,649
quite a crescendo in recent years months

268
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,180
and weeks and days there's a lot of

269
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,800
truth in us I love this word it was a

270
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,600
word invented by a u.s. comedian named

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,610
Stephen Colbert and the word basically

272
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,769
means something that has no evidence of

273
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,319
whether it's true or not but it sounds

274
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,350
if it's as if it's true has the quality

275
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,629
of possibly being true and therefore is

276
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,639
easily believed when expressed over and

277
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,959
over again

278
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
it's what Noam Chomsky calls concision

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,939
this idea that if you can state an idea

280
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,129
briefly because it's fitting with ideas

281
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,379
people already have you're more likely

282
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,999
to convince them over to your argument

283
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,899
because you're basically just

284
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,939
reinforcing their confirmation bias

285
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,499
whereas if you want to explain something

286
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:12,899
complicated that might have a lot of ins

287
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,459
a lot of outs needing more time what

288
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,870
also happens is there's a lot of

289
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,189
revisionist history happening with

290
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,379
regard to copyleft here's an interesting

291
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,829
example David what house who is a Linux

292
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:27,540
developer he's part of our coalition who

293
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,699
enforced the GPL with us asked this

294
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:35,249
question of Greg cage and Greg said that

295
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,279
he does want to see compliance with the

296
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,959
GPL I think Greg and I have always

297
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,480
agreed about that but he thinks suing

298
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,429
them is the suing any violators the

299
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,439
wrong answer because we've been so

300
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,120
successful with that without ever suing

301
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,650
anybody

302
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,240
that's a bit of revisionist history

303
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,460
we've been enforcing the GPL for a very

304
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,620
long time and not just on busybox which

305
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,870
is probably what I'm better known for

306
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,200
being related with it's been on Linux

307
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,790
since the advent of the embedded system

308
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,320
this thing came out

309
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,720
it ran Linux it had no source code offer

310
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,360
source code was not available in the

311
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,650
spring of 2003 a coalition of developers

312
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,120
whom I helped particularly I helped Erik

313
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,890
Anderson but also involved was hard

314
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,620
Delta we all did a GPL enforcement

315
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,990
action that took about 10 to 12 months

316
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,850
to accomplish at the end of it we not

317
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,070
only got source code we created a free

318
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,140
software community if you go back if you

319
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,210
find the old SV entry of open wrt you

320
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,130
will see the first check in it matches

321
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,400
almost byte for byte what we were able

322
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,420
to achieve from Cisco and Linksys as the

323
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,240
compliant source release for that device

324
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,430
that community is still vibrant today

325
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,810
mitad lee has a fork at the moment but

326
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,020
both sides of the fork oh this action

327
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,560
this specific enforcement action for all

328
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,990
their history I don't know how many code

329
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,840
got how much code got up streamed from

330
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
open to bare teeth there's a lot of

331
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,930
upstream crossover now but I don't

332
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,670
expect that revision Wan had tons of up

333
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,070
streamable code but it was incredibly

334
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,000
important not just forever w net every

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,190
wrt54g owner but for everyone who has

336
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,740
ever installed an alternative firmware

337
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,260
on the router ever in their life they

338
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,280
owe it in some part to this GPL

339
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,930
enforcement action now Rob LAN Lee who I

340
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,880
worked with quite a bit on GP law

341
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,670
enforcement for a while he's against GPL

342
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,490
enforcement now quite publicly he even

343
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,100
used he's recently publicly said that he

344
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,930
used some of the funds he got from GP

345
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,880
law enforcement to fund a non copyleft

346
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,940
replacement to busybox I think that's

347
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,040
great actually I think it's good to

348
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,180
write more free software whatever

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,310
license it's under but his main

350
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,700
complaint was that and all the

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,290
enforcement he and I did together I

352
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,270
never gave him a single upstream patch

353
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,730
patch to busybox which is true

354
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,649
and I had the good opportunity to see

355
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,510
Rob at Linux contra just last week and

356
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,139
we settled this issue and I think we now

357
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,690
understand each other I never thought

358
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,519
that up streaming code was the top

359
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,139
priority because I don't think it is the

360
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,899
top priority of the GPL the top priority

361
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,870
of the GPL and its primary goal is to

362
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,870
make sure downstream users who wish to

363
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,779
be developers either knowing it or not

364
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,790
ie they're gonna serendipitously become

365
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,230
a developer or they already want to be

366
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,070
have the code to the device in their

367
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,339
hands and can make actual real use of

368
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,050
that source code to build a new binary

369
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,320
and then over time as happen with open

370
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
wrt and now the lead project also become

371
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,070
upstream developers so it's not a

372
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,750
immediacy of getting upstream code it's

373
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,610
about developing and building a

374
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,560
community of upstream and downstream

375
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,660
who's slowly and well and work well

376
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,709
together over time and expand because of

377
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,779
the code promulgating under copyleft

378
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,569
that's why GPL v2 even GPL be to a

379
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,279
common misconception and people think

380
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,930
this kind of language is only in v3 it's

381
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,899
right there in v2 compilation and

382
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,930
installation matter they really really

383
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,980
matter they mattered when I had my PC

384
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,740
when this was the standard version of

385
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,019
GPL and that matters even more now in

386
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,220
the same conversation this is what

387
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,589
Mathew Garrett had to say about it he

388
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,760
put it better than I did I think this is

389
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,529
what it's really about but certainly

390
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,180
what it was about for me certainly I had

391
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,860
that thing at 19 and I was doing what

392
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,060
Matthew is talking about here now the

393
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,240
kids today as we old people say won't

394
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
have one of these but they're gonna have

395
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,399
this and it's gonna be running Linux and

396
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,110
they probably won't right now how the

397
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,339
source code for it and they'll have one

398
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,069
of these they probably already do that's

399
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,350
running Android which is Linux

400
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,660
underneath and they probably don't have

401
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,620
the source code for

402
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,310
and now the refrigerator is gonna have

403
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,530
Linux we used to talk back in those

404
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,060
compost MINIX days that eventually your

405
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,230
toaster will run Linux

406
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,760
it was a joke then but it's not so much

407
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
of a joke now refrigerator is one step

408
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,520
away now from toasters and this thing

409
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,340
now I like TV and most people in our

410
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,020
community it seems don't like TV shows

411
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,380
so much but some of us do and your TV is

412
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,880
probably running Linux if you have one

413
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,190
in fact this is the first device that a

414
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,240
lot of people are going to interact with

415
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,660
this one and that one are the first two

416
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,980
devices they're gonna see in their lives

417
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,470
most of the time these days and if

418
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,100
they're running Linux they might

419
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,160
actually become a developer but if

420
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,330
they're running Linux and that's

421
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,800
violating the GPL which is the case

422
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,380
right now they won't have the

423
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,060
opportunity to become a Linux developer

424
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,650
they will think of his devices as shut

425
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,930
down and we need enforcement to make

426
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,920
sure that they can Conservancy has

427
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,869
fought exactly one busybox lawsuit

428
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,609
against the number of defendants one of

429
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:23,400
whom was Samsung and in fact Samsung was

430
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,410
violating the GPL came into compliance

431
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,900
which is very good of them to do and it

432
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,790
spawned yet another community like the

433
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,070
open debate to you not as big not as

434
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,540
many people have Samsung TVs as have

435
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,910
wireless routers but there is a vibrant

436
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,050
community of people developing an

437
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,870
alternative firmware for Samsung TVs you

438
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,790
can actually run your own DVR on an SD

439
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,490
card on a Samsung TVs exam ego that's

440
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,440
the kind of innovation that happens when

441
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,530
you have software freedom now long ago

442
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,660
when this all started there wasn't tons

443
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,980
of different markets tons of different

444
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,940
products running links there were

445
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,820
wireless routers and there was a guy I

446
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,680
just mentioned Herod Volta Herald ironic

447
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,230
to say now who's really really angry at

448
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,170
me that I didn't push to sue Linksys in

449
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,640
Cisco right away and from 2004 to 2013

450
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,230
he went off and did his own enforcement

451
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,730
because he thought the enforcement that

452
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,470
Eric and I were doing on busybox

453
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,920
was not good enough and that more

454
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,580
lawsuits needed to be filed and he filed

455
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,000
a lot of them over the years this is of

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,580
course the timeline when Linux was

457
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,510
rising

458
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,430
lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit as

459
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,500
linux rises to be in every device in the

460
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,380
world so when people say that we've done

461
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,200
so well without ever suing anyone with

462
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,620
linux we didn't live in that particular

463
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,520
quantum reality

464
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,060
I didn't anyway maybe I've crossed like

465
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,070
Worf did in that episode and you all

466
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,330
remember a different history than I do I

467
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,310
don't know but as far as I know we

468
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,600
didn't I think in fact the GPL is a

469
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,310
reason that Linux was successful it's a

470
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,990
reason it was more successful than the

471
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,350
BSD s and it's enforcement was part of

472
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,180
that I think it's fun to say that we

473
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,500
don't need GPL enforcement because if

474
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,090
lawsuits and GPL enforcement endanger

475
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,410
Linux they've been endangering it since

476
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,530
2002 so if this is the world that

477
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,190
endangered Linux makes I think it's ok

478
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,760
not so bad

479
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,500
we have Linux and lots of lots of lots

480
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,940
of devices but meanwhile compliance is

481
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,810
more and more rare most devices on the

482
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,090
market are violating the GPL I used to

483
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,130
keep count I just have a giant email

484
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,360
folder of all the ones people have

485
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,150
emailed to the Conservancy I I couldn't

486
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,140
even count them anymore

487
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,860
I made a about because eight nine years

488
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,510
ago I made a bet with the world that I

489
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,250
could find a GPL violation for debt per

490
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,920
day for a year I did that of course it

491
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,200
got boring after like day like 80 or 90

492
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,390
but I did it and what's even bigger now

493
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,770
is I'm talking a lot about Linux because

494
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,860
that's sort of where the the political

495
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,330
pressure and the political fight is

496
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,610
happening but it's not just about

497
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,320
busybox and limits there's Samba in

498
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,690
these devices there's ffmpeg and whole

499
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,760
bunches of other GPL software that

500
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,190
people put the GPL on because they

501
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,530
wanted software freedom for their users

502
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,290
and they're not getting it and it's not

503
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,910
just about Linux now we talk a lot about

504
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,070
Linux about the GPL I think for the

505
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,520
obvious reason because it's a kernel

506
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,560
which means the center of something so

507
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,390
it's the center of the operating system

508
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,580
so it's the kernel it's GPL so it's

509
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,800
obviously going to be the one that we

510
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,790
talked about first

511
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,690
and it's in all these devices and it's

512
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,630
violating and all those devices and

513
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,680
plenty more as well how about this kind

514
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,350
of my hero I told him recently that I

515
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,510
should have listened to him back in 2004

516
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,520
he was absolutely right

517
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,690
and it's unfortunate that he's gotten

518
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,770
busy with other things which are really

519
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,500
great projects but he's not available to

520
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
do enforcement the moment he wanted to

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,470
get started again but has not been able

522
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,870
to find the time so for the moment with

523
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,900
regard to Linux at least and Samba as

524
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,190
well Conservancy is the only

525
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,280
organization doing community oriented

526
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,010
enforcement what do I mean by community

527
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,010
or enforcement we have a list of

528
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,090
principles these are not first

529
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,350
principles these are sort of the

530
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,210
principles that fall out from the first

531
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,220
principle because if your goal is to get

532
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,020
software freedom for users there are

533
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,540
certain ways that you have to do GPL

534
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,760
enforcement to make sure that you're

535
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,590
doing it in a principled way that feeds

536
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,500
into that first principle now these are

537
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,090
principles that I followed for many many

538
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,220
years myself but I'd never written them

539
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,290
down so when Karen started working the

540
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,820
software freedom Conservancy she

541
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,320
suggested we actually write them down

542
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,590
and we actually codify them in a formal

543
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,420
way and make a public process to allow

544
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,400
people to comment now people have not

545
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,410
joined our public process they sort of

546
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,450
are complaining off to the side and I

547
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,830
hope they will join and talk about our

548
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,030
principles but I think they're pretty

549
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,170
good and the one that is most pertinent

550
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,670
to the current political debate is this

551
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,350
one because we've always said that

552
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,400
lawsuits are really bad if you have to

553
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,960
get to them and you should try to avoid

554
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,910
them and we've avoided and avoided and

555
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,980
avoided lawsuits in every case where

556
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,210
we've had to file one and because of

557
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,030
that the fact of the matter is Gregg and

558
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,840
I agree on almost everything about GPL

559
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,390
compliance and enforcement there's a

560
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,180
tiny tiny place where we don't agree

561
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,590
very very tiny and it's on I think a

562
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,600
relatively minor point and this is how

563
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,900
it goes I asked Greg if you have a GPL

564
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
Beiler's been violating for ten years

565
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,910
they're completely savvy they understand

566
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,620
completely what their violation is

567
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,180
in fact you've figured out that they

568
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,010
planned from the start to violate the

569
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,570
GPL and try to get away with it and

570
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,850
they've told you to the face there's no

571
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,550
way they're ever gonna comply and just

572
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,100
go away I asked her what should I do in

573
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,260
that situation you said you should walk

574
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,270
away so what that means is the worst of

575
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,070
the worst of wireless routers people who

576
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,440
actually try to make you know sneaky

577
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,850
little proprietary kernel modules that

578
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,040
do weird Network stuff are the ones who

579
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,170
will get away with violations and the

580
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,059
tablets that try to have proprietary

581
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,490
video and all sorts of other device

582
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,710
drivers and Linux that are not free will

583
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,730
get away with it because they're the

584
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,170
ones that are gonna stand firm and say

585
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,120
fine sue us and that TV when somebody

586
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,010
writes a DRM module for Linux and that's

587
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,450
to make a proprietary to the DRM

588
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,740
actually works they'll get away with it

589
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,970
cuz they're gonna say no you'll have to

590
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,100
sue us if you want us to liberate that

591
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,580
code so the worst in that strategy the

592
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,140
worst of the worst violators the ones

593
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,780
who really really planned to hurt the

594
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,340
free software community get away with it

595
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,510
and the ones who just made mistakes

596
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,630
actually come into compliance it seems a

597
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,790
little backwards to me now the fact of

598
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,520
the matter is it's companies who are

599
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,440
most upset that there have been lawsuits

600
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,910
about the GPL it's company

601
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,830
representatives hangar destabilizing our

602
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,860
industry they have destabilized their

603
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,600
industry pretty well already there are

604
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
hundreds of lawsuits everywhere but

605
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,809
every year between various tech

606
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,059
companies all the time there's this

607
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,010
service called pacer it's actually free

608
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,510
for your first 10 services if you want

609
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,309
to search the US legal system you can

610
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:29,260
search for companies and see wow there's

611
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,700
all these lawsuits between them I never

612
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,800
heard about I tried to count earlier

613
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,660
today I went through every single

614
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,429
lawsuit I could think of and I counted

615
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,260
many of them twice like I counted our

616
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,240
one busybox lawsuit against fifteen

617
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,860
defendants is 15 it's like okay call

618
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,179
that 15 even though it was only one

619
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,860
because there was 15 defendants if you

620
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,929
count in the maximum possible way I

621
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,590
couldn't get past the mid-40s and that's

622
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,840
in the entire history of GPL enforcement

623
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,920
at least in the quantum reality I'm

624
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,220
living it so how is it that companies

625
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,140
can be so angry at us that we filed 50

626
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,640
lawsuit when they filed thousands

627
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,170
against each other

628
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,760
they continually a politically attack us

629
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,130
even companies that have countersued for

630
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,810
GPL themselves come back and attack us

631
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,930
for violating the GPL and specifically

632
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,550
they're really really angry about

633
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,770
Christoph's case and in that case we're

634
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,450
funding Christoph to do what's right

635
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,100
about his code on code he holds

636
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,320
copyright on the funny part is is it's

637
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,850
not just that side that's angry that

638
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,550
being Karen for doing enforcement our

639
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,170
friends are mad at it it's too because

640
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,880
of this one this principle they don't

641
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,270
like this year at renewal time for for

642
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,970
Conservancy supporters who joined last

643
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,160
year to donors wrote to us and they said

644
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,940
beside pretty much the same thing that

645
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,660
well you're just not being aggressive

646
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,310
enough you should be getting so much

647
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,540
money out of these companies that you're

648
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,760
funding a giant operation to enforce and

649
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,990
get everybody into compliance but

650
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,160
everybody has the source code they

651
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,020
deserve and you're just not doing it

652
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,550
right you should be making them pay

653
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,020
through the nose so you can roll the

654
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,580
money forward and keep enforcing and

655
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,690
keep enforcing now we did a little bit

656
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,060
of that we got those defendants in that

657
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,740
busybox lawsuit into compliance and if

658
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,630
you go and read very very transparent

659
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,570
you can see exactly how much money

660
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,340
Conservancy took in from those lawsuits

661
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,410
and we did use some of that money to

662
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,390
fund future GPL enforcement but we've

663
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,070
been doing this Linux enforcement for

664
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,490
five years and I'm slightly ashamed to

665
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,370
say and all the Linux enforcement I've

666
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,470
done I have not gotten a single company

667
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,900
into compliance yet i we have matters

668
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,850
open that I opened the day we got the

669
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,990
first people signing up for our

670
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,600
coalition's those matters are still open

671
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,610
today Karen there's two emails you have

672
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,580
to send on those you know but yeah I

673
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,900
mean we're still working on those

674
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,450
matters Karen and I after five years and

675
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,900
the reason is proprietary kernel modules

676
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,580
they come into compliance on all the

677
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,930
easy stuff right they're like oh yeah

678
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,970
well we have a we fix our build system

679
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,230
and now you can build the software and

680
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,770
everything and we say that Cato file is

681
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,840
a combined work with Linux you have to

682
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,580
give us a source code to that they say

683
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,990
well let's talk about all these other

684
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,160
issues we're fixing let's talk about

685
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,420
those for a little longer we talk about

686
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,070
we dutifully say well we'll talk about

687
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,600
those let's get it we'll put that aside

688
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,000
we'll talk about that last finally we

689
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
get to that being the only

690
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,500
and they don't do it they don't come

691
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,050
into compliance now if we wanted to do

692
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,790
what our allies are asking us to be more

693
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,860
aggressive I don't think we can in that

694
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,380
scenario because of this principle this

695
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,970
principle is the most important one to

696
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,270
me I think it is complete corruption if

697
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,000
you take a dime from a company who is

698
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,430
still out of compliance because

699
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,020
basically you're at that point being

700
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,450
paid off to look the other way so I will

701
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,430
not work for Conservancy I will resign

702
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,590
the day we take a dime from a company

703
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,320
that's in an active violation but that

704
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,910
also means I have to do this which I

705
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,190
hate doing but if we're gonna go this

706
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,700
way

707
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,770
and we're gonna say let's never be

708
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,410
corrupt let's never take money from

709
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,510
anybody who's in active violation then

710
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,600
we have to ask you to donate as was

711
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,830
mentioned in the last talk in this room

712
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,480
there is a supporter mat running if you

713
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,830
sign up as a sport for Conservancy of

714
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,120
the donation will be matched by an

715
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,250
anonymous donor for the next week so I

716
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,590
hope you will do it I also want to tell

717
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,470
you that we don't like this work it's

718
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,310
not like I'm enjoying it my political

719
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,020
opponents who have attacked me and

720
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,120
attacked Karen as well have kept saying

721
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,640
that somehow we you know we this is like

722
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,620
we're trying to make our careers out of

723
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,360
this you don't make your careers out of

724
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,090
something that's boring in fact my at

725
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,470
least my career is screwed like I can

726
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,640
work two places for the rest of my life

727
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,230
that's all for freedom Conservancy or I

728
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,610
could go back and work for the FSF I

729
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,230
guess I could go be like we're gonna

730
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,270
coffee shop or something but that's it

731
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,780
because no one will hire me so why would

732
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,750
I do that to myself for any reason other

733
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,070
than because I care about this community

734
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,310
and I want to do good things for it

735
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,540
there's no other reason I wouldn't

736
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,810
bother I'd love to be a developer again

737
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,340
I used to be a software developer it

738
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,710
used to be a sysadmin I guess I would be

739
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,240
antiquated because I don't say DevOps I

740
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,360
still say sysadmin but whatever I would

741
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,220
love to do that work again but this is

742
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,960
too important and there's so few people

743
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,580
doing it it's what Harold did Harold is

744
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,020
a software developer and he said

745
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,270
enforcement is pouring and annoying and

746
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,950
I care about it but I want to write new

747
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,090
free software for the woman's

748
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,549
some great new free software he's

749
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,169
written an entire GSM stack that's

750
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,610
completely free software it's really

751
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,710
amazing but he doesn't want to do GDP

752
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,539
enforcement so it leaves people like me

753
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,270
and Karen to pick up the slack

754
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,659
I was asked in my pretty awesome

755
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:44,720
interview which you can read online the

756
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,730
conference organizers this wasn't really

757
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,990
a question they just sort of stated it

758
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,679
but I took it as a question I answered

759
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,029
that it's absolutely I agree with this

760
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,909
completely I want every developer in

761
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,100
this room to know I

762
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,390
I want to live in a world where you

763
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,850
would know if I put the GPL on my code

764
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,890
if I'm editing code that's under the GNU

765
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,870
general public license or any of the

766
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,090
similar licenses like the affero GPL or

767
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,990
l GPO that my software is forever free I

768
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,909
want that to be true but again I don't

769
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:17,539
live in that quantum reality copyleft is

770
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,520
not magic pixie dust we don't sprinkle

771
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,960
it on code and clap our hands and

772
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,820
suddenly it flies that's not how it

773
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,059
works it's difficult to keep copyleft

774
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,490
working there's a back-end process that

775
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,500
you have to do and we have someone has

776
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,909
to take care of that for Linux

777
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,909
now I care a great deal about both GPL

778
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:39,950
and Linux so it's strange the care and I

779
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,230
have been accused of caring more about

780
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,159
one than the other

781
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,260
a credits have said well you care about

782
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,399
more you care about copy oh if you don't

783
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,799
care what happens to Linux it's as if

784
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,090
they're saying we're gonna sacrifice

785
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,809
Linux for it the altar of the great GPL

786
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,039
as if GPL where principle not a strategy

787
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,220
the thing is is Linux and GPL both are

788
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,110
not as important as people think they

789
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,970
are and I'm probably going to get that's

790
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,590
going to be the little sound bite that

791
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,539
my political opponents quote but it's

792
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,059
true and I will say the truth what

793
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:12,380
matters about Linux is it's a community

794
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,929
of people developing software it's a

795
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:16,159
community that has some bugs that need

796
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,659
to be fixed that's much more important

797
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,179
than anything else in some ways about

798
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,500
how they treat each other and so forth

799
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,960
on the mailing list but the key thing I

800
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
think is valuable about Linux is that

801
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,890
it's GPL then gets to the next

802
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,919
generation in these devices who pick it

803
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,330
up start hacking on it and then join

804
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,559
that community the community grows

805
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,600
that's the world that I wanted to live

806
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,010
and that's the world that excited me

807
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,389
when I got that laptop in 99

808
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,589
- and that's the world I want to

809
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:44,219
preserve really code and licenses both

810
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:46,769
are ephemeral maybe I'm too much of an

811
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,179
academically trained computer scientist

812
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,379
but my professors always said the code

813
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,389
doesn't matter the ideas behind it the

814
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:54,389
ability to express computation is what

815
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:56,009
matters and you rewrite code all the

816
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,690
time Linux is being rewritten from the

817
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,570
ground up inside the Linux project

818
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,239
dozens of times over the years in the

819
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,279
long term freedom matters long term

820
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,570
freedom matters more making sure that

821
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,039
everybody has the right to copy share

822
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,809
and modify the software that they have

823
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:12,839
today matters more than what happened

824
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,219
yesterday or what happens tomorrow and

825
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:15,749
making sure that they can do it in

826
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,679
perpetuity is what GPL is designed to do

827
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,889
matters I want to make sure new

828
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,269
developers can hack their devices that's

829
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,149
the most important thing to me and I

830
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,259
want them to be able to join the

831
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,029
communities that don't require

832
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:33,359
proprietary software to join them that's

833
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,099
the world I'm trying to create Linux is

834
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,349
an excellent project to do that with the

835
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:38,999
GPL is an excellent license to do that

836
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,549
with but we can't mix up the principle

837
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:43,950
with the specifics of success of one

838
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,659
particular project under one particular

839
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,329
brand Conservancy is actually really

840
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:55,379
just an agency for all of you we don't

841
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,119
do anything unless developers ask us to

842
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,739
do it that's true in our conference

843
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,389
organizing work we don't organize random

844
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,089
conferences we organize conferences that

845
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,619
developers asked us to organize and it's

846
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,440
true and our GPL enforcement work we do

847
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,269
it because developers came to us and

848
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:11,129
said I would like you to enforce my

849
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:15,299
copyrights for me so the future of GPL

850
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,549
the future of copyleft as a strategy

851
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:19,979
does not really rests with Conservancy

852
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,609
at all it rests with those of you that

853
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:25,619
write GPL code those of you that

854
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,629
generate copyrights assuming you're

855
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:29,419
actually generating their own copyrights

856
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,950
this is happening in pretty much every

857
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,089
it's not just Linux it's happening

858
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,409
pretty much every project except for

859
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,619
Samba what some Bahasa policy that

860
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,929
developers should be allowed to keep

861
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:41,519
their own copyrights and it's preferred

862
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,749
for the developers to have their own

863
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:44,579
copyrights and if you want to contribute

864
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:45,899
to the project you have to get an

865
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,339
agreement from your employer that you

866
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,649
can do so most other projects don't work

867
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:50,559
that way and

868
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,200
four time companies have moved to the

869
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,820
top and things like unknown and none

870
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,399
which it's pretty mean to tell call

871
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:58,779
independent developers it really should

872
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,330
say independent developers there because

873
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,509
that's who that probably is as is

874
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,440
consultant and this unknown and so forth

875
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,339
everything else is companies there are

876
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,790
company strong company up there whom

877
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,069
when I met with a person in their

878
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:17,649
open-source division told me you will

879
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:19,089
have to keep watching my company forever

880
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:22,060
their plan is to violate every time

881
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,270
you're not looking and that company's on

882
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,310
that list so if we're in that world

883
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,649
if those kind of companies are holding

884
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,079
the copyrights of Linux they can disarm

885
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,849
copyleft with a stroke of a pen

886
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:36,099
eventually once they get all the

887
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,418
copyrights everywhere so what's most

888
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,280
important for the future of copyleft is

889
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,109
for people to keep their own copyrights

890
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,260
which is a position that key Linux

891
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,510
developers believe deeply in leanness

892
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,929
has always kept his own copyrights Greg

893
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,819
KH keeps his own copyrights James

894
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:56,440
Bottomly posted to a mailing list

895
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,540
recently saying that he has done as much

896
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,460
as he can as in career to make sure that

897
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,900
he and other developers can keep their

898
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,569
own copyrights I had a conversation with

899
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,760
leanness and he told me actually I would

900
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,710
I know you used to work for the FSF and

901
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,660
you do that copyright asana I'm against

902
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,980
that stuff every developers have the

903
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,839
right to choose for himself or herself

904
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,920
well he just said himself what license

905
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,420
they get to put their software under and

906
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,069
how it's enforced and when it's enforced

907
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:25,720
and who helps them with enforcement that

908
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,280
was stated to me by leanness as a

909
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,619
principle of his and I pretty much agree

910
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,030
about that I think Karen and I both

911
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:36,099
agree about that and that's why we do

912
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,780
what we do because developers who do

913
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,160
hold their own copyrights have come to

914
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,750
us and asked us to be the who why and

915
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,450
when and where of their GPL enforcement

916
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,109
efforts and the nice part about that is

917
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,760
it's a very transparent regulatory

918
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,390
mechanism eventually if everybody's

919
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,400
angry at how we're doing enforcement we

920
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,349
will dismantle the project cuz everybody

921
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:58,750
will leave and if it grows because

922
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,910
people join it will grow

923
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,410
the interesting thing about all this is

924
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,850
out of these politics got worse we

925
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,470
actually went to our coalition's and

926
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,119
said maybe this is too politically

927
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,410
enviable maybe you don't want to do this

928
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:10,860
anymore

929
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,230
and they'd rather vehemently said no

930
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,750
please do not stop keep going keep going

931
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,760
this is important for me because that's

932
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,410
why I put GPL on my coat ironically

933
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,290
that's what's caused this battleground

934
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,800
and that battle ground was created by

935
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,369
the people that opposed the GPL I wish I

936
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:33,869
was good as a politician as they are

937
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,540
some days I'm just too honest I think

938
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,340
we're only going to do what our projects

939
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,910
asked us to do and enforcement again I

940
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,250
say is just one of the many things we do

941
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,010
to advance software freedom we worry

942
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,450
about logistics of projects we run

943
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,780
conferences and pretty much anything

944
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,300
that comes along that we think is going

945
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,590
to impede software freedom if our

946
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,140
projects are feeling strongly about it

947
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,570
we feel strongly about it too that's why

948
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,070
Conservancy last week made this

949
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,660
statement this is actually just an

950
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,859
excerpt the full statements online I

951
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:13,380
don't think we can stand silent in the

952
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,119
current climate as somebody from the

953
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,660
u.s. coming to Europe I felt an

954
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,250
obligation to put this on a slide and

955
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,619
let you know that we are concerned as an

956
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,270
organization because these kinds of

957
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,340
larger global politics impact our

958
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,220
ability to share free software with each

959
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,430
other

960
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,330
yeah it's weird living in the US I was

961
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,460
born there I grew up there you know it's

962
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,530
it's hard to leave your home so I really

963
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,300
didn't even consider leaving beside you

964
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,369
don't want me to leave because that you

965
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:56,380
know you can guess that I didn't vote

966
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,970
for Trump so that's one less person

967
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,470
there that's gonna vote for somebody

968
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:05,500
else so the politics of it are sir I

969
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,119
think politics have a way of seeping

970
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,070
into everything and I think that the

971
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,750
global politics the truthiness the

972
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,640
revisionist history it has seeped its

973
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,920
way in and I see this weird thing

974
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,340
happening Karen mostly but I as well and

975
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,170
some conferences have been running these

976
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,550
compliance feedback sessions where we

977
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,840
asked developers to come and tell us

978
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,160
what we're doing wrong we hear all this

979
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,230
vitriol about what we're doing

980
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,190
constantly from company representative

981
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,600
we figure well are the developers mad

982
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,070
too they tell us the developers are mad

983
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,290
we should ask them and the responses are

984
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,970
basically almost overwhelming

985
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,200
compositive they have these little tiny

986
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,730
tweaks like most developers they want to

987
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,900
come and sort of tweak the system be

988
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,800
like well if you did this slightly

989
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,910
differently wouldn't that work better

990
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,040
but other than that they're just giving

991
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,840
us positive feedback and saying we're

992
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,050
doing a good job and meanwhile we get

993
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,910
these constant criticisms coming at us

994
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,980
and all sorts of different it's kind of

995
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,230
sneaky political ways people do sneaky

996
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,060
political things to come after us all

997
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,520
the time I don't know why they're doing

998
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,010
it I'm truly baffled

999
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm truly baffled my best guess is that

1000
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,270
they're actually afraid that you'll all

1001
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,410
figure out that you're actually in

1002
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,830
control I often say that if every single

1003
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,450
software developer woke up in the world

1004
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,100
woke up tomorrow and said I will never

1005
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,450
write in line a proprietary software

1006
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,310
code again the free software movement

1007
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,710
would win overnight now it's a silly

1008
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,390
example because that's not going to

1009
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,760
happen but it goes to my point that each

1010
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,520
developer individually has a linear

1011
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,760
incremental influence on what happens to

1012
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,369
software freedom so you're going to have

1013
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,540
to get your control back

1014
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,529
the most important thing you can do is

1015
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:44,619
go to your employer and tell them you

1016
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,809
want to keep your own copyrights you

1017
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,249
should decide your licensing strategy I

1018
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:50,349
don't even care if you all go and do

1019
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,959
that and say I'm gonna use the IFC

1020
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,450
license I think developers should be in

1021
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,489
control of which free software license

1022
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:02,109
they pick not companies but if free

1023
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:03,279
software's going to succeed it's going

1024
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:05,499
to be dependent on developers being in

1025
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:07,229
control to policy not just code

1026
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:10,059
companies will trick you they've they

1027
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:13,779
understand what we do and they will give

1028
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,789
you lots of exciting technical problems

1029
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,209
to distract you from policy work on the

1030
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,469
technical problems but don't forget

1031
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,440
about the policy while you do it that's

1032
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,279
all I have to say thank you

1033
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:45,859
I know the university needs us to leave

1034
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:46,969
quickly do we have time for questions

1035
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,789
yes I think we have time for a few

1036
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,529
questions I'll pack up during questions

1037
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:55,189
so we got here so if brevity is a gift I

1038
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,109
know this is a topic where it's tempting

1039
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:00,169
to present your opinion but please try

1040
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,149
to focus on on the question so we can

1041
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:03,799
have lots of questions and if you leave

1042
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,349
the room please do so quietly so we have

1043
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,119
two microphones and I will start here

1044
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,739
thank you for the door when you were

1045
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,630
discussing the business of not taking

1046
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,069
money from companies to overlook

1047
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:18,439
violations which yay

1048
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:21,049
you then went straight to therefore I

1049
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:23,929
have to ask for contributions to the SFC

1050
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,909
which struck me as a bit of a false

1051
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:28,159
dichotomy it seems to overlook the

1052
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,299
question of costs Awards

1053
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:34,579
it seems to overlook the issue of costs

1054
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,829
awards could you discuss briefly whether

1055
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,959
you think those have any role to play in

1056
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,929
making violators pay for being sued oh I

1057
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:43,939
think that it's absolutely reasonable

1058
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:45,679
and we wrote the principles very very

1059
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,039
carefully

1060
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:01,300
so I think that we were very careful

1061
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,770
interacting the principles to say that

1062
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,359
monetary gain shouldn't be a priority

1063
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:06,190
and you shouldn't take money from

1064
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,440
somebody who's still violating but we do

1065
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,480
in our enforcement actions ask for them

1066
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,730
to cover the costs of compliance that

1067
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,530
they that they incurred and in the

1068
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,849
busybox loss stage you can go read our

1069
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,650
form 990 s and see that we received

1070
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,960
money from those violators because they

1071
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,790
were fully in compliance the weird

1072
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,460
situation we have now is that and this

1073
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,740
is what I said in my LCA talk in 2016

1074
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,050
that everybody attacked me for but the

1075
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,460
fact of the matter is is the only way

1076
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,510
we're gonna get any of these Linux

1077
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,430
violators in the compliance is probably

1078
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,290
to sue them because they keep saying we

1079
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,640
will not release the source code to that

1080
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,410
proprietary module for years and years

1081
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:38,890
and years

1082
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,569
which is exactly what VMware did which

1083
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:42,069
is exactly why Christophe had to sue

1084
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:44,400
them and that case is still pending I

1085
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,630
hope that the German system would be

1086
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,819
faster than the US it's turning out that

1087
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,920
it kind of isn't it's taking just as

1088
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,720
long as US cases tend to take so we have

1089
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,310
to wait for the courts to deal with it

1090
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,920
and while that's happening we have to

1091
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,359
keep funding it and I hope you'll donate

1092
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,520
it's up here the next question yeah hi

1093
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,650
my name is Peterson Achuthan and I am a

1094
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,480
Kano developer and what you do in

1095
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,680
situation is in which you have a

1096
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,660
developer that simply completely

1097
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,369
disagree with you I don't feel that you

1098
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:17,109
represent my interests as I cannot

1099
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:19,089
develop what what you do in situations

1100
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,310
like that and I consider myself a

1101
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,270
community guide so it's I what you do in

1102
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,560
situations like that I'm not I'm not

1103
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,720
defending that companies are good or

1104
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,920
anything from the community perspective

1105
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,160
you simply don't represent me so what's

1106
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,079
your take on that is that you're saying

1107
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,910
you don't feel Conservancy represent

1108
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,349
your views yeah so you shouldn't sign

1109
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:42,700
one of our enforcement agreements they

1110
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
are public online you can read them you

1111
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,210
should tell people why you don't agree

1112
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,500
with you should tell us why you don't

1113
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,880
agree with this and maybe we should

1114
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,940
change our behavior so that you could I

1115
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,380
think the most important thing is that

1116
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,880
you are in control as a developer

1117
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,109
whether you agree with me or not

1118
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:58,089
right and suppose you're like a BSD

1119
00:43:58,089 --> 00:43:59,109
developer which means you probably

1120
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:00,579
disagree with me about a lot of things I

1121
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,380
think if your BSD developer you should

1122
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,010
have your own

1123
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,930
rights to and license them under the BSD

1124
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:05,980
license because that's what you believe

1125
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,650
in that's what I think is most important

1126
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,050
in all this and that's important as a

1127
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,060
meta strategy right I talked about how

1128
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,760
copyleft is just a strategy well it's

1129
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,910
important that we try all the strategy

1130
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,950
at once including licensing things under

1131
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,450
non copyleft license isn't a whole host

1132
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,060
of other things but I really put my face

1133
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,310
and develop with basement faith in

1134
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,040
developers developers are the people

1135
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,630
that created this community and they

1136
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,700
understand it and they care about what

1137
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,530
happens to their software for their

1138
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,570
users so I want you in charge of that

1139
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,550
decision-making process not some

1140
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:47,220
corporate lawyer over here I've got it

1141
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,090
so I'm one of those people who thinks

1142
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,070
you should be more aggressive I heard

1143
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,390
you donated anyway thank you

1144
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,470
yeah so you say on your slides you know

1145
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,430
the GPL to projects you know violators

1146
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,800
should get the benefit of GPL v3 like

1147
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,040
termination clauses um personally I

1148
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,870
wouldn't even go that far I think they

1149
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,580
should be encouraged to switch to GPL 3

1150
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,200
because the GPL two's termination

1151
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,290
clauses are terrifying but if you don't

1152
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,240
want to go that far you could give them

1153
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,280
the benefit of something very like the

1154
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,530
GPL 3 termination clauses come into

1155
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,320
compliance within 60 days otherwise well

1156
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,450
in that case when you have come into

1157
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,210
compliance we will need a fat wad of

1158
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,930
cash as well to restore your rights and

1159
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,420
I think that's roughly what happened

1160
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,920
with the busybox lawsuits that

1161
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,460
conservancy did I wouldn't say we asked

1162
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,980
for a quote fat wad of cash at quota as

1163
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,560
you put it I think we asked for our cost

1164
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,380
to be covered reasonably and and making

1165
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,480
sure that we had a sustainable model I

1166
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,130
believed at that time we could make a

1167
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,350
sustainable model but I didn't I I

1168
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,390
basically underestimated when I was

1169
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,770
doing this before Karen work with us

1170
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,490
that that these Linux violators would be

1171
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,340
so strident and ready to basically go to

1172
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,670
court I'm amazed to this day that VMware

1173
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,200
just didn't remove the Linux code

1174
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,390
they're trying to do it now for the new

1175
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,340
products but not the old ones but they

1176
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,720
could rewrite their current

1177
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,310
such that they took all Linux credit out

1178
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,740
it is possible to comply with the GPL

1179
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,830
just by not incorporating the code that

1180
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,140
sheep yelled anymore they don't have to

1181
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,400
release vmkernel

1182
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,440
they can remove the GPL to stuff from

1183
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,260
vmkernel why they didn't do that for the

1184
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,390
years that people were complaining to

1185
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,920
them that they had violated I don't know

1186
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,480
I don't I truly don't understand it it's

1187
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,530
bizarre to me I and and so because of

1188
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,810
that situation it means that there's not

1189
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:45,700
revenue coming in because I'm not gonna

1190
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,080
take a dime from any of those companies

1191
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,090
I'll stop and I don't think Karin would

1192
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,599
agree to that either right so up here

1193
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,010
very up here yep so I was wondering if

1194
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,220
you are able to attract people who are

1195
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,540
who don't have a software background but

1196
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,160
have a legal background so you can sort

1197
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,369
of bring people into the Conservatives

1198
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:21,640
conservancy yeah yeah so are you able to

1199
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,589
bring in fresh blood with more of a

1200
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:28,060
legal background than a software

1201
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,310
background half of our staff have we

1202
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,690
have a staff of four and half of them

1203
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,550
have law degrees so I think we've been

1204
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,230
successful in that Karen and Karen is

1205
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,710
one of them but yeah there aren't many

1206
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,089
lawyers who will work for a non-profit

1207
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:42,010
wages though a lot of people go to law

1208
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,349
school to get rich that's a fact of fact

1209
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:47,260
of life and so cuz you that's another

1210
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,430
thing you'd see on a farm damage you can

1211
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,050
see how much we get paid as well you

1212
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,640
will notice that we do not get paid as

1213
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,330
much as law firm lawyers by far we're

1214
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,480
we're

1215
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:09,680
Sarek does the software freedom

1216
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,890
Conservancy maintain a list of active

1217
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,690
violations and companies that violate

1218
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,619
the GPL so that consumers can look at it

1219
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:20,539
and say I don't want to buy products

1220
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:23,059
from those fenders anymore so that's

1221
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:25,520
very similar to what Eric Anderson once

1222
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,410
maintained called the Hall of Shame for

1223
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,980
busybox

1224
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,750
one of our principles you might have

1225
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,940
noticed is this idea of maintaining

1226
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,710
confidentiality now that particular

1227
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,470
principle has been criticized I think

1228
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,079
that that principle is important because

1229
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,420
it is still true that while the most

1230
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,130
strident violators are these ones with

1231
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,140
these proprietary Linux modules the

1232
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,990
overwhelming majority of violators often

1233
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,089
have no clue that GPL software's in

1234
00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:52,039
their product so going and publicly

1235
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:53,960
shaming them doesn't seem right to me I

1236
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,700
would rather work with them to get in

1237
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,130
compliance and so we have looked at the

1238
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,049
idea of trying to get community members

1239
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:01,940
involved to help those types of

1240
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,079
companies that are likely to be

1241
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,180
responsive to engineers but there are

1242
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,400
very few people that can do that and it

1243
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,230
also has a public shaming expect if we

1244
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,980
run that as a individual project okay

1245
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,569
they want to give me the next question

1246
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:17,359
sorry yeah it will be the last questions

1247
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,760
I think you will talk to you later to

1248
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,010
hallway talks if yeah you can be found

1249
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,359
tomorrow so your last question yeah

1250
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,470
thank you so this is a question about

1251
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:32,240
paragraph 2 of the GPL b2 if if I were

1252
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,869
to distribute a subsection please the

1253
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,319
final paragraph the final paragraphs the

1254
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:41,180
three final paragraphs out you mean the

1255
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,250
penultimate that it is so if I were to

1256
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,339
distribute a phone with a GPL 2 app and

1257
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:49,910
userspace

1258
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,210
is that phone a whole work or is that

1259
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:58,210
phone a volume storage medium so the GPL

1260
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,210
doesn't decide that in a sense that is a

1261
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,069
question of the copyright regime you're

1262
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,289
operating under never forget that GPL is

1263
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:08,240
a copyright license which means it

1264
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,890
operates under the copyright law in the

1265
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,390
jurisdiction you're in

1266
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,720
when you go to act about it and that was

1267
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,300
by design it's what is called Stallman

1268
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,349
called strong copyleft so the goal was I

1269
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:22,520
Jeremy or Michael Meeks invented this

1270
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,780
phrase I'm not sure which

1271
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,180
it's the judo move of copyleft it takes

1272
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,359
the force of copyright and says I'm

1273
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,210
gonna push back with maximum force using

1274
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,760
that force against itself and so it's

1275
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,830
trying to get as far as copyright law

1276
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,020
goes and as copyright law expands ie

1277
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,940
declares more things derivative works

1278
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,880
then of course GPL will cover those

1279
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,010
things as combined or derivative work so

1280
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,140
it works or as gplv2 puts it works based

1281
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,080
on the program so I can't answer that

1282
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,060
question every buddy always asks it and

1283
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,950
that's the the phrase that makes people

1284
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,599
angry it makes corporate lawyers angry

1285
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,520
because they're their anger as well you

1286
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,050
won't tell us what we're allowed to make

1287
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,060
proprietary well you were gonna wait for

1288
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,200
the court to do that creates uncertainty

1289
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,589
etc etc that was how it was designed in

1290
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:09,680
1988 that was the plan from the start

1291
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,830
and my glib answer is always if you're

1292
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,450
not sure make everything you do free

1293
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,750
software or don't put any GPL software

1294
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,210
in it you can always do that that's the

1295
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,770
classic place where I clash with a lot

1296
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,560
of people because I still believe what

1297
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,119
Stallman said about this which was if

1298
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,250
you want your software to be maximally

1299
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,160
popular use a non copyleft license if

1300
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,020
you wanted to maximally defend freedom

1301
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,089
use the strongest copyleft license

1302
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:37,160
available so it's a trade-off right I

1303
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,780
know people are going to be afraid from

1304
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,430
that issue you raise and say oh my gosh

1305
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,619
I can't do this and I know it's painful

1306
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:44,150
if you work in a company where you're

1307
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,010
trying to get free software adopted but

1308
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,020
remember the GPL was designed to defend

1309
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,820
your freedom and the conversation you're

1310
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,980
actually having is how much freedom can

1311
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,080
we take away please tell us and you say

1312
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,040
you're not allowed to take away any

1313
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,720
freedom but can't we take a little bit

1314
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,880
of freedom well you'll have to ask a

1315
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,349
lawyer why should we have to ask a

1316
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:01,430
lawyer how much freedom we should take

1317
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,869
away you should tell us how much we can

1318
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,920
oppress you don't fall into that trap

1319
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,010
