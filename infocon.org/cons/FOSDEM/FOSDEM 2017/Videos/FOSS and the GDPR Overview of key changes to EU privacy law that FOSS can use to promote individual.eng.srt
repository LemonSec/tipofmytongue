1
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:06,750
as usual there are a lot of great

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,000
sidebar conversations going on if you if

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,440
you're having a great conversation that

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,789
ask you to take it to the hallway track

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,070
so that we can start now with mark tones

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,900
today so a little bit about myself

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,320
before we get started the obligatory I

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
am a lawyer I'm not your lawyer this

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,059
isn't legal advice I work for a company

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,769
I work for civic action that in-house

11
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,350
counsel and compliance in here but these

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,239
are my views these are not to use my

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,500
employer and a little bit about the

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,899
presentation so the DPR is the new EU

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,430
privacy law it's going to be coming to

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,530
effect next May

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,390
generally there's no specific

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,620
requirements that any software

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,210
manufacturer has to implement in their

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,489
software so Foss developers I'm not here

21
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,930
to tell you what you need to do to

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,449
comply with this law so presentation

23
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,840
over but I do think the gdpr presents

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,119
some opportunities for Foss projects in

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,910
terms of promoting your own project but

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,190
more importantly promoting the privacy

27
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,530
rights of yourself and your friends and

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,899
neighbors and that's really what I want

29
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,149
to talk about so why I listen to this

30
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,640
presentation well I think you should

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,830
listen to this presentation because if

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,099
you're a FASTA Vela / I have come to

33
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,280
believe that Foss developers in American

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,020
parlance I know this is probably not the

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,209
right word to use for Europeans are

36
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,360
basically civil libertarians so in the

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,739
United States what a civil libertarian

38
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,569
would mean is someone who is very

39
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,080
concerned with promoting individual

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,819
liberties so freedom of speech freedom

41
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,750
of religion freedom from constraint from

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,599
government control that terminology

43
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,660
changes from country to country and I

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,369
learned this when I was working at the

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,539
software freedom Law Center as an

46
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:02,069
attorney I used to ask software

47
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,410
developers why do you care about free

48
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,530
software because no one puts all of this

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,360
work into creating software and giving

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,610
it away for free free in the garroted

51
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,800
sense let's think of doing it for a

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,300
reason like they must really care about

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,740
something and most of the time what

54
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,060
my clients and people in Mehta

55
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,950
conferences would tell me is they're

56
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,510
concerned about control they want

57
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,580
control over their own computer they

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,140
want to know what programs are running

59
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,110
on their own computer but they're doing

60
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,550
more than that too because they're not

61
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,690
just writing software for their own

62
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,070
computer they're writing software for

63
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,560
other people's computers as well and I

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,660
think the other thing I noticed about

65
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,370
free software developers too is they're

66
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,190
kind of obsessed with encrypting things

67
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,650
I don't know and you know anyone like

68
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,360
that who might be a little upset but

69
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,620
they everything better when it's

70
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,660
encrypted and I think everything's

71
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,700
better when it's encrypted mostly and

72
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,020
same reason why they want control over

73
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,760
things they want control over who has

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,700
access to their data and it generally

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,260
comes from a sense of people are

76
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,680
concerned about privacy so why I think

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,720
people should be phos developers should

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,980
be concerned with the GPR is that phos

79
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,870
developers aren't just concerned with

80
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,610
control their own computer they're not

81
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,230
just concerned with encrypting things

82
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,910
they're concerned about privacy and I

83
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,430
mean privacy in a broader sense probably

84
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,280
the way most lawyers mean about it so

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,660
and I'm gonna point to a couple

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,310
documents or one document particular

87
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,490
what faust these are the three documents

88
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,860
that I usually talk about when I'm

89
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,510
trying to explain to businesses or

90
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,670
clients what it means to be an

91
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,290
open-source license or a free software

92
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,880
license or a Floss license or FASTA

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
license or whatever you want to do

94
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,590
they're all related historically they

95
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,140
come from one each other so generally

96
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,610
you're not gonna find a license that

97
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,100
meets one of the standards for the free

98
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,320
software definition or the Debian so W

99
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,120
naught social contract or the open

100
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,260
source definition that doesn't meet the

101
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,990
other months but I think the the free

102
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,030
software definition is probably the

103
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,620
easiest one to explain from my point I'm

104
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,260
trying to make here when I tell my

105
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,630
friends and family what I do is I help

106
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,580
FASTA Vella / as I work in the field of

107
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,500
free software and they say what's free

108
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,120
software like shareware the kind of

109
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,340
things winzip and I'm like now think of

110
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,770
this great quote free is in free speech

111
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,980
not some free beer which some people

112
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,540
think oh that's kind of ridiculous it's

113
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,040
not very serious like well I mean it is

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,780
actually in the free software definition

115
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,850
that's a direct quote from them and I

116
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,979
think that really goes to what what

117
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,590
floss is it's it's not about just

118
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,960
writing code and giving code to other

119
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,370
people are having your own code in your

120
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,370
computer it's about freedom and I think

121
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,750
if you look at the free software

122
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,610
definition the four freedoms which

123
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,810
there's probably some people this room

124
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,160
who know these four freedoms better than

125
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,300
I do I know there's some people whose

126
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,410
dream to know these for freedom tonigh

127
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,940
you I have to go back and read them but

128
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,849
when I went and I looked this up I kind

129
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:52,960
of divided them into two different

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,990
things the first two are really about

131
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,970
freedom zero freedom to run the programs

132
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,069
you wish for any purpose the freedom to

133
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,810
study how a program works and change it

134
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,490
so that you does you're competing as you

135
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,560
wish these are freedoms about how you

136
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,990
interact with your computer what your

137
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,150
computers doing with the data on your

138
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,710
computer right because computers really

139
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,639
aren't that useful unless they're

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,229
operating on data right so this is about

141
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:15,970
how your computer is operating on your

142
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,930
data the second - and this is what I

143
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,599
think makes Foss political and makes

144
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,919
people civil libertarians because it's

145
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,650
not a selfish action the second two are

146
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,810
about freedoms to help other people

147
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,699
freedom to redistribute copies of the

148
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,710
program so you can help your neighbor

149
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,300
it's explicitly in there and freedom too

150
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,949
and the freedom to distribute copies of

151
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,300
your modified version of those programs

152
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,940
freedom three to make that program

153
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,979
better to respect that person more so

154
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,900
they have more control over how their

155
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,610
computers operating and what it's doing

156
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,289
with their data right it's not about

157
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,849
telling other people what they should be

158
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,349
doing with their data it's about giving

159
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,849
them the choice and the freedom to do

160
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:56,550
that so how does this relate to the gdpr

161
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,870
well first I want to point out the

162
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,490
privacy is more than just encryption I

163
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,199
think a lot of people think that privacy

164
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,070
is about hiding your wrongs or making

165
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,810
sure that people can't find out what you

166
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,710
did and I think that's a that's an

167
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,880
underestimates or does this service to

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,190
the value and importance of society of

169
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,289
Prophecy to society and if you think

170
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,120
about it from that way

171
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,810
authoritarian regimes you're gonna

172
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,310
actually kind of win the argument about

173
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,110
why it's okay for them to invade your

174
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,960
privacy so I want to point to a book

175
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,789
called nothing to hide by Professor Dan

176
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,280
SOLAS who's a law professor specialized

177
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,199
in privacy law in the United States and

178
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,710
his view about privacy is it's not just

179
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,780
about hiding wrongs privacy is more than

180
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,479
that privacy private violations of

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,250
privacy aren't just Orwellian where the

182
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,860
state knows everything about you they're

183
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,639
Kafka ass

184
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,580
because it's about what they're doing

185
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,860
with your information right so it's not

186
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,689
that just keeping the government from

187
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,340
not watching you so they don't know

188
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,870
everything about you but you also want

189
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,789
to know when you give up some of your

190
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,349
data when you exchange that for

191
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,819
something else you let something know

192
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,590
something about the people know

193
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,050
information about you you care how that

194
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,300
information is going to be used because

195
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,099
it matters to you it has an effect on

196
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,650
you right you're sharing data because

197
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,569
you want to relate to other people you

198
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,009
might want something from them maybe

199
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,330
you're training your you know

200
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,020
biographical information for like free

201
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,639
software you can use facebook for free

202
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,500
all you have to do is be the subject of

203
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
targeted advertising okay well you can

204
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,889
do that but you also trade information

205
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,599
and intimate relationships - right

206
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,699
you tell your spouse or your girlfriend

207
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,710
or your boyfriend intimate details about

208
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,629
you because you want to establish a

209
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,629
relationship with them establishing

210
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:41,409
those relationships creates control over

211
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,819
each other people's lives and sometimes

212
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,960
that's good right you want your

213
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,460
girlfriend your boyfriend your husband

214
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,810
your spouse to be able to influence you

215
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,699
and sometimes you want advertisers to

216
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,409
influence you too because you want to

217
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,060
buy the best product you want to find

218
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,379
out about those good things and that's

219
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,740
fine but violations of privacy where you

220
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,060
don't have control over how your

221
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,250
information being used affects the

222
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,560
balance of power in that relationship

223
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,330
right so damn Sola have talked about it

224
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,889
with the relationship with modern state

225
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,180
and that's where traditional privacy

226
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,500
might come from is what is the state

227
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,789
spying on but this is also true of

228
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,560
corporations how much control does a

229
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,629
corporation have over you in part

230
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:14,860
depends about how much they know about

231
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,860
you so a simpler way to think about

232
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,539
privacy that kind of encompasses all

233
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,800
this instead of just secrecy is a

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,569
classic American legal definition is

235
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,250
privacy is the right to be let alone

236
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,500
right it's the right not to be bothered

237
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,659
by other people to have them intrude in

238
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,250
your life it's not just about keeping

239
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,828
things secret so how does this relate to

240
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,328
the general data protection regulation

241
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,578
well you'll notice that the P and the GD

242
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:39,429
P R does not stand for privacy but we

243
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,229
think most privacy lawyers in the world

244
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,390
would say that GD P R is going to be the

245
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,730
leading regulation or law in the world

246
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,220
on privacy but it's about data

247
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,079
protection right because privacy is

248
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,880
about how data is being used how your

249
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,620
data is being used in your relationship

250
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,620
to it so I want to tell you a little bit

251
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,410
about what it is the GE PR

252
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,360
what does it protect the rules of

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,949
founding and some of the basic rules or

254
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,870
principles of the GDP are keep in mind

255
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,870
this is like a 200-page regulation so

256
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,490
I'm not gonna go into great detail she's

257
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,980
gonna give you a broad overview so what

258
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,959
is it the general data protection

259
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,550
regulation it's going to replace the

260
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,399
current EU regulation for privacy rules

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,350
so right now in the EU there's a

262
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,490
directive and the difference in a

263
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,899
directive and a regulation is a

264
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,730
directive is a requirement from the EU

265
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,889
that all of its member states and enact

266
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,240
certain laws that meet certain

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,310
requirements so all the member states

268
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,829
have laws internal to them that are

269
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,720
substantially similar to other member

270
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,399
states and the idea being is well the

271
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,589
laws are basically the same so it makes

272
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,300
it easier to operate or move between

273
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,610
jurisdictions a regulation on the other

274
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,800
hand is a law that's implemented at the

275
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,170
EU level so that every single member

276
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,540
state the law is exactly the same well

277
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,250
barring the fact that it's in six

278
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,019
different languages and maybe that's

279
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,100
some cause problems but I'll leave that

280
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,509
to an EU attorney to tell you how that

281
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,800
works as an American that confuses me so

282
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,060
this law doesn't come in effect until

283
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,540
May 2018 so next year so you might be

284
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
wondering why I'm talking about it now

285
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,319
is because right now all of the

286
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,910
companies in the world that are affected

287
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,279
by this are freaking now because they

288
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,750
need to figure out how to comply with

289
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,269
this law and may 2018 so they're making

290
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:18,699
decisions about compliance with this law

291
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,319
right now the other thing the point

292
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:24,819
about this regulation why it's gonna be

293
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,910
kind of broad I know I'm a technologist

294
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,050
myself I work with a lot of

295
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,579
technologists I give them legal I give

296
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,410
technologists legal advice they always

297
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,670
want things as specifically as possible

298
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,110
what do I have to do

299
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,480
GTR doesn't tell you what you have to do

300
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,149
it's a technology roof neutral it's risk

301
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,560
based so anyone here has been in

302
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,420
compliance or in security or privacy

303
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,399
engineering they probably had go through

304
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,399
like our risk assessment or an audit

305
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,660
where they're saying like well I can't

306
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,579
tell you exactly what you have to do but

307
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,959
these are the things you should kind of

308
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,399
be thinking about but you're the expert

309
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,100
you tell me what you have to do the gdpr

310
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,809
is basically listening to that

311
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,420
methodology I'm gonna tell you why I

312
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,759
think that's a good thing so you can

313
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,160
read more specifically what the gdpr is

314
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,920
trying to do lays down rules related to

315
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,420
protection of natural persons with

316
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,490
regard to processing of personal data

317
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,329
and the rules were

318
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,290
the free movement of that personal data

319
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,790
you can parse that a little bit more if

320
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,230
you want but what is it bit what does it

321
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,860
protect basically it applies to personal

322
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,829
data right so personal data is basically

323
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,779
anything about you or can be identified

324
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,790
about to a particular person and applies

325
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,379
the natural persons doesn't actually

326
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,360
apply to dead people so the person's

327
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,069
breathing it applies to them it doesn't

328
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,660
apply to legal persons they don't

329
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,519
breathe you got to be breathing for this

330
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,809
to apply to you so this really is about

331
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,279
protecting people's data and not

332
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,230
corporations data actually is a little

333
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,660
bit broader than just computers anytime

334
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,069
you're doing any kind of processing an

335
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,350
automated way or an organized filing

336
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,480
system pledge to so technically like a

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
business's rolodex of like clients they

338
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,959
have if they've gotten a traditional

339
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,970
paper rolodex it applies to that as well

340
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,069
so there's no real there's no almost

341
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,329
scape vowels really at least they

342
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,009
haven't found it yet there are a couple

343
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,689
exceptions I think the most important

344
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,970
one and why this doesn't really require

345
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,459
Foss developers generally to do anything

346
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,309
is it doesn't apply it doesn't regulate

347
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,879
the use of data by natural persons and

348
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,559
purely personal or household activity

349
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,049
now personal and household activity

350
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,369
we'll see how that gets defined

351
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:22,989
underneath the old directive it was

352
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,600
fairly narrow but you know if you're

353
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,489
using data you've got a mailing list for

354
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,839
all your family members or some of them

355
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,910
Christmas cards it doesn't matter how

356
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,259
many people you're sending that those

357
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,480
Christmas cards to if you've got a big

358
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,429
family it's still personal activity it's

359
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,509
the kind of thing you do in your

360
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,249
household and of course there are

361
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,230
exceptions because they're still going

362
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,329
to spy on you right so but at least the

363
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,299
the nation state to do the spying on you

364
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,549
and who does it apply to so if it

365
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,769
doesn't apply to Foss developers and

366
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,819
people doing their household activities

367
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,699
who does it apply to pretty much applies

368
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,799
to everyone else right so if you're a

369
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,959
controller or a processor established in

370
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,489
the EU and I'll explain what those are

371
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,649
so you're a business in the EU it

372
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,779
applies to you if you're offering goods

373
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,149
and services in the EU it applies to you

374
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,559
right so all the big American tech

375
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,589
companies it applies to them or anyone

376
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:11,919
else

377
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,499
EU applies to and honestly international

378
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,110
law not my specialty so giving you a

379
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,389
good simple definition of who you

380
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:22,629
applies to can't really do that but it's

381
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:23,949
there catch all right it's basically if

382
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,419
you're doing any business with the EU in

383
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,630
any way if bu

384
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,130
haul you into the court they're gonna

385
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,690
say you've got to follow this regulation

386
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,990
so it applies to a lot of people so

387
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,970
basic summary gdpr applies to everyone

388
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,850
processing data on EU citizen unless

389
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,390
you're doing it for personal use so

390
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,070
controller these are basic words you'll

391
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,810
find in the EU regulation controllers

392
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,460
the guy who wants your data or collected

393
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,290
the data processors the guy who's

394
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,880
actually doing things to the data so you

395
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,740
might have a big business like a shoe

396
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,000
manufacturer who doesn't run his

397
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,400
computing facility shoe manufactures the

398
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,860
controller Pagani outsource is sending

399
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,140
out mailing or data mining 9/2 is the

400
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,300
processor processing I'll show you a

401
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,710
legal definition of that in a second

402
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,510
processing is basically doing anything

403
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,250
to data and why I mean anything to data

404
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,970
I mean anything to the data data

405
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,980
subjects that's you the people who are

406
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,930
still breathing up the dead ones in

407
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,450
personal data basically any information

408
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,250
that could be reasonably identified

409
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,980
about you reasonable as a key word in

410
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,170
there we'll talk about our reasonable

411
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,120
and appropriate bucket so these are the

412
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,920
definitions of processing and personal

413
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,780
data you can see it's a very long list

414
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,820
of verbs feel free to read that on your

415
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,680
own time so basic rules these aren't

416
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,060
really rules I'm gonna tell you the

417
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,090
purposes and the goals of the gdpr which

418
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,950
i think are pretty good right so this

419
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,390
goes back to us talking about it before

420
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,390
but what is privacy so and you've you've

421
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,830
if you've been in this room for the last

422
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,180
few days like I've heard you've heard

423
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,590
these words too because these things

424
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,850
people are really concerned with right

425
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,560
so one of the goals is transparency we

426
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
heard about that in the last session

427
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,370
transparency what are you doing with

428
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,660
well if you're talking about a financial

429
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,640
sponsor for fossilization what are you

430
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,770
doing with my money but if you're giving

431
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,420
your data to someone else what are you

432
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,010
doing with my personal information right

433
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm gonna give you my medical record

434
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,830
what are you gonna do with that I want

435
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,810
to know I want to give my doctor my

436
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,160
medical information cuz I don't want to

437
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,410
kill me accidentally but I don't know if

438
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,970
I want someone to figure out that I'm

439
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,710
like the perfect person to turn into

440
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,240
like a cyborg like that's probably not

441
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,320
things that I want them to just go

442
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,840
experiment with purpose limitation right

443
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,270
so like I gave you for one purpose don't

444
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,680
use it for another purpose even if

445
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,130
you're gonna tell me data minimization

446
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,360
only Kyle only asked me for the data you

447
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,250
actually need don't don't ask for more

448
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,190
data than you've really need accuracy I

449
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,100
you do if you're gonna do things to me

450
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,120
because that's what it's about is it

451
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,500
doing things to me but proximately data

452
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,550
make sure you're doing it based on

453
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,990
accurate information right so don't

454
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,000
assume that I'm like well off in the

455
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
United States right now like don't

456
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,820
assume that you're not a US citizen and

457
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,920
deport you accidentally which we do all

458
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,300
the time

459
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,610
storage limitation only keep the data

460
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,080
for as long as you're actually doing it

461
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,460
for the reason you collected it for

462
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,990
right so you can't ask for it for one

463
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,370
process and then do something else with

464
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,960
it but if you can't do something else

465
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,280
with it and you fulfilled that purpose

466
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,100
it's time to get rid of it in integrity

467
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,900
and confidentiality so this is kind of

468
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,570
where encryption falls in and you have

469
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,520
to use appropriate and technical and

470
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,170
organizational means to protect the data

471
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,750
if any of your academics here like there

472
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,370
are some exceptions for research there

473
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,420
so you don't think this is really gonna

474
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,610
shut down research for social services

475
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,250
or healthcare or anything like that

476
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,290
they're not gonna let that happen so but

477
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:27,980
I want to talk a little bit about

478
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,690
proprietary z'l because this kind of

479
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,490
goes into why I think Foss developers

480
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,580
care so quick search for the gdpr text

481
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,530
the word appropriate to use 80 times and

482
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,450
the implementing rules in over 110 times

483
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,460
in the entire text and the word

484
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,230
reasonable is only use 10 times I'm

485
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,400
pretty sure if it were written by an

486
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,410
American attorney they use the word

487
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,050
reasonable a heck of a lot more and

488
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,610
because I'm an American attorney I'm

489
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,350
gonna kind of make the assumption that

490
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,900
appropriate and reasonable means similar

491
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,310
to the same thing I don't know if it's a

492
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,080
good assumption there's anyone who

493
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,540
practices EU and American law can tell

494
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,430
me this is a terrible assumption let me

495
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,920
know so this is one of my favorite cases

496
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,579
in US law and it gives you a short

497
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,500
succinct definition of what reasonable

498
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,260
or appropriate actions are I will not

499
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,119
read you the whole thing but basically

500
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,869
it's defining when you have a reasonable

501
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,119
thing to do is when the burden is less

502
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,060
than the probability of an injury

503
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,580
occurring so B less than P times L right

504
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,980
so mathematical terms everyone here now

505
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,240
understands what they're supposed to do

506
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,370
right reasonable things when the burden

507
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,750
is less than the probability of the

508
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,350
injury occurring

509
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,559
has a connotation of objective anyone

510
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,690
else objectively choose the same thing

511
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,450
okay my understanding of the word

512
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,950
appropriate is it's listening to best

513
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,110
practices in the industry so it is

514
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,880
actually kind of similar in the larger

515
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,159
and big Uli's of American law I'm sure

516
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,590
they're not exactly analogous but for

517
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,730
this audience I think they're probably

518
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,070
close enough maybe not for a legal

519
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,230
audience so the GDP are some of the

520
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,639
things that it points out that are

521
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:21,480
appropriate measures they might include

522
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,649
these right these are not always

523
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:24,480
required in every case they might be

524
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,220
required sometimes sued an itemization

525
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,380
or encryption of the personal data if

526
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,510
it's appropriate ensure confidentiality

527
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,909
integrity and availability right so just

528
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:36,750
do that just ensure it ability to

529
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,519
restore access to personal data in a

530
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,210
timely manner

531
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,700
just make sure that's done you don't

532
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,929
have any problems figuring out what's

533
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,429
required thereafter technologists you

534
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,970
just do that and process for regularly

535
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,230
testing and evaluating the effectiveness

536
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,330
of these controls that's also easy to do

537
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,740
anyone who's the systems administrator

538
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,600
in the room can just go down this list

539
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,220
and check them off I'm sure right I mean

540
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,559
these are pretty broad standards it's

541
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,090
basically not telling you how to do this

542
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,409
at all but I think a couple important

543
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,330
things about gdpr is the controller is

544
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,399
responsible for demonstrating compliance

545
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,130
with the gdpr right so they're

546
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,510
accountable and they have to show that

547
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,950
they're accountable so it's not about

548
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,049
prove that I didn't follow these rules

549
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,330
it's telling corporations you need to

550
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,740
prove that you're following these rules

551
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,049
which puts a big onus on them because

552
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,090
it's not about what can I do to get away

553
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,010
with this it's like what do I need to do

554
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,510
to show that I'm not going to get in

555
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,049
trouble

556
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:31,139
a couple other things I want to point

557
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:33,179
out about this is that when you're

558
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,409
processing data you've got to have a

559
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:37,260
lawful reason for doing that and my

560
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,700
experience at least amongst American

561
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,230
attorneys who are discussing the GDP are

562
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,480
the main reason they're looking for is

563
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,669
the data subject has consent now it's

564
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:45,990
not the only reason that they might be

565
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,580
processing your data I think there are

566
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,500
seven or eight legitimate reasons for

567
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,210
processing data but they're telling

568
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,130
corporations if you can find a

569
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,200
way to ground you're processing in

570
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,990
consent this is the safest one because

571
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,370
the other ones you're probably going to

572
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,740
get some pushback on so consent and

573
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,090
affirmative consent is what they mean

574
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,310
here is going to be a big deal in this

575
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,790
regulation so why should Fox developers

576
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,310
care about this regulation so I can

577
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,320
think of three main reasons self

578
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,970
promotion is one of them right so if

579
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,590
you're making fast software that's used

580
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,570
by corporations in the EU they're all

581
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,740
freaking out right now about how to

582
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,570
comply with the GDP are they're gonna be

583
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,490
very concerned with well if I use your

584
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,290
Foss offer does that help me or hurt me

585
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,880
when it complies with the GDP are right

586
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,680
so it's about transparency and

587
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,870
accountability and knowing what the

588
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,130
prostitutes going on they're like what

589
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,630
is your software do what does it collect

590
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,530
those are things we've been concerned

591
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,540
with but I think the more important ones

592
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,650
are people in this room because I do

593
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,110
think that phos developers are civil

594
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,700
libertarians in the American sense they

595
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,680
care about other people's privacy it's

596
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,540
can we use the GDP are to strengthen

597
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,850
privacy rights for ourselves and our

598
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,580
friends and does the GDP are present any

599
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,080
opportunities that phos developers might

600
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,580
want to take advantage of that

601
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,750
corporations probably weren't

602
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,990
volunteering before so here's a list of

603
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,790
things just going through the GDP are

604
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,650
that I think a lot of corporations going

605
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,000
to be going to their IT department

606
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,710
saying hey just you know implement all

607
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,410
this stuff I don't think these are all

608
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,060
things that Fosters are only cost

609
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,200
responsible for doing any of these

610
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
things I don't need to make some of them

611
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,380
are really relevant so I'm not going to

612
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,030
spend too much time on that because this

613
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,650
isn't a compliance talk that's for

614
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,820
corporations and I'm not here to tell

615
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,960
you that phos developers have

616
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,430
responsibility to help corporations save

617
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,850
money by doing their work for them what

618
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,380
I think is more important is to look at

619
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,850
that list and say which one of those

620
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,990
would actually strengthen private

621
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,120
privacy rights so I think phos

622
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,830
developers have an opportunity to help

623
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,280
define what is appropriate so if you ask

624
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,650
a corporation well what can you do to

625
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,840
private to protect someone's privacy

626
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,280
what are the appropriate steps you need

627
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,440
to do to ensure confidentially integrity

628
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,660
and availability of data they're gonna

629
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,520
do the math and say like well you know

630
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,680
how much is it gonna cost me if I

631
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,540
violate this regulation how much is it

632
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,800
gonna cost me to implement this

633
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,750
protection and they're gonna figure out

634
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,790
the cheapest way for them to comply with

635
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,100
the rule right that's their motivation

636
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,510
is to make the money which is fine

637
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,680
that's what corporations are supposed to

638
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,630
do Foss developers on the other hand

639
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,020
might

640
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,580
ask a different question right so when

641
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,380
it comes to the appropriate means for

642
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,660
protecting data they might want to say

643
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,240
well what's actually practical for

644
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,670
protecting people's privacy they're not

645
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,990
asking though well how much is it gonna

646
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,180
cost that might ask the practical

647
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,620
question of like well it might cost a

648
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,820
little bit more but it gives us better

649
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,430
protection it's you know I'm not worried

650
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,040
about the fine so much is like if I were

651
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,080
trusting my data with someone else this

652
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,520
is what I would hope they would do for

653
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,010
me if I were trusting holding my

654
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,050
sister's data how much effort what I

655
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,030
would put into protecting my sister's

656
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,820
data so it's a chance to define

657
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,470
appropriate which really is about

658
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,840
raising the bar on what privacy

659
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
protections exist right so if the foss

660
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,450
community can do this it's going to end

661
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,130
up influencing corporations or has the

662
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,780
possibility inform corporations in two

663
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,030
ways one well the fox community makes a

664
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,980
lot of software and a lot of that

665
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,630
software gets used by corporations right

666
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,640
so if you're building software that's

667
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,650
already respecting people's privacy and

668
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,540
it go and a corporation chooses to use

669
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,020
it

670
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,850
you're now helping their customers that

671
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,020
they're interacting whether the people

672
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,090
they're holding data on the other thing

673
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,770
is is if they don't like that they don't

674
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,480
like that raise bar that you put into

675
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,610
your software they could change it right

676
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,350
they're free to do that Foss lets them

677
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,240
do that but how they need to explain to

678
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,950
a regulator while they remove some

679
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,040
privacy protection right the other thing

680
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,750
is is that by creating the community

681
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,250
standard we can create expectations

682
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,950
amongst users and set an example for

683
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,810
regulators right so even if they're not

684
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,240
using Foss software they might say well

685
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
you know that's great but you have a

686
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,300
blogging service over there but you and

687
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,710
you're saying it's too complicated to

688
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,000
get the data out of it so someone can

689
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,350
move to another blogging service because

690
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,580
you know it's a vast network of

691
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,080
friendship relationships you're tracking

692
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,360
but here are these guys over here who

693
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,650
don't get paid they do this on the

694
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,200
weekend and they're able to exchange

695
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,960
data from their platform to another

696
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,880
platform and they managed to preserve

697
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,310
all those things if you make a billion

698
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,050
dollars a year off of making a blogging

699
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,720
platform I don't understand why they

700
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,280
were able to do it and you couldn't I

701
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,930
mean do you not have enough money to pay

702
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,250
for people's weekends is that the

703
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,700
problem the other thing is creating

704
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,860
expectations for users right so you know

705
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,300
this is an opportunity to show users

706
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,490
phos actually does respect you I hear

707
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,000
that a lot

708
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
use software that respects the user like

709
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,169
well let's respect them and more and

710
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,220
just giving them control over their

711
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,320
computer but let's create software that

712
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
helps respect users data even when they

713
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,470
don't have the compute that software on

714
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,520
their own device so here's the long list

715
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
of things that are going through there

716
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,630
these are some that I think are

717
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,059
particularly relevant to Foss developers

718
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,860
and I just want to go through a little

719
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,570
bit talk a little about what I think

720
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,030
projects could do if it's applicable to

721
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,360
you that would make a difference I would

722
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,380
see him talking in very general terms

723
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,850
it's going to depend from project to

724
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,480
project

725
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,059
but consent must be affirmative I think

726
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,000
is probably an easy one so part of the

727
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,950
new regulations is its codifying that

728
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,110
when you give consent that's got to be

729
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,490
an affirmative action so what's an

730
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,500
affirmative action so when you go to a

731
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,030
website and you're about to sign up for

732
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,950
that service and they're gonna collect

733
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,510
data about you they're gonna give you a

734
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,690
long well it used to be it will give you

735
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,400
a long understandable description of

736
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,480
what they're gonna do with all that data

737
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,610
in the box had already be checked and

738
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,380
you could just hit okay at least that's

739
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,880
how it stills in America and probably

740
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,220
will stay that American America I signed

741
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,809
a contract the other day where if you

742
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,539
read it you could find embedded inside

743
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,370
of the paragraph there was a checkbox

744
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,679
pre check that said I waive my rights to

745
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,080
file a class action and as long as you

746
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,210
were willing to go to like xx page and

747
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,860
look in the middle of a paragraph and

748
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,140
text it was smaller you could find the

749
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,620
checkbox pre-checked it's not really

750
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,299
affirmative consent if you hit I agree

751
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,260
to that agreement that you also

752
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,210
affirmatively consented to agree to

753
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,740
waive your right to class actions sure

754
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,850
there was a checkbox I could have

755
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,950
unchecked but I had to find it right so

756
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,559
if you're building Foss software where

757
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,090
people are signing up and agreeing to

758
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,010
certain terms of services or if you're

759
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,590
building a module Foss software where

760
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,480
they they're adding in like the ability

761
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
to agree to certain terms just make it

762
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,280
real easy just make that box the agree I

763
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,789
agree box unchecked by default right

764
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,740
that's all you have to do now a

765
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,299
corporation that's going to use that

766
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:19,890
perhaps I modify because a lot of

767
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,140
smaller companies do they don't have to

768
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,059
go through and find that they're gonna

769
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,380
say no I didn't agree to in the first

770
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,390
place right like that's the way it's

771
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,000
come should be by default so do that the

772
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,230
other thing you can do related to this

773
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,630
too is make it easy to opt-out of

774
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,440
proxies so

775
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,759
if you've got a piece of software that

776
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,970
performs multiple different functions

777
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,679
can you make it so that a user of that

778
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,360
software has the ability to opt out of

779
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,059
some part of that process that doesn't

780
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,360
break the whole product so if you're

781
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,549
gonna have someone might sign up for

782
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:53,639
like a user forum and that form might

783
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:55,110
also have like social networking

784
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,029
features as well so people can find them

785
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,529
well they might want to have access to

786
00:26:58,529 --> 00:26:59,909
the forum but they don't want to publish

787
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,129
their user data right so let them turn

788
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:03,929
off to have the ability to have it

789
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,490
listed in a directory or some kind of

790
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,169
social networking forum but let them

791
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,120
still access the directory give them

792
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,559
that option build that into your

793
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,870
software architecture software so that

794
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,399
they can choose which parts they're

795
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,299
actually going to use sudra nomination

796
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,690
and minimization when possible I don't

797
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,009
know how much this applies to foster

798
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,450
ectly although I'm sure it's out there

799
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,620
none of the projects that I've dealt

800
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,970
with directly but I certainly see it

801
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,649
working in San in house when we bring

802
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,929
this offer in developers seem to collect

803
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,029
all the data they possibly can on a user

804
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,429
registration form so whenever you have a

805
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,350
user registering your software you have

806
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,789
to I know this is absolutely mandatory

807
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:41,389
you have to ask for the Twitter handle I

808
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:45,570
don't know why it's very uncommon that I

809
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,980
see people may actually ever have that

810
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,080
integration with Twitter but we've got

811
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,990
that twitter handle data just in case we

812
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,210
decide to use it later and then even

813
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,649
when I go back and I ask them because

814
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm finally not a privacy impact

815
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,100
assessment I said well do we ever use

816
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,899
the Twitter handle for anything they're

817
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,789
like well no not really and I'm like boy

818
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,740
do you mean by use I'm like we'll do you

819
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,870
ever like display it or a lot of people

820
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,610
to search on it or interact with Twitter

821
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,070
and like well I mean technically we

822
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,870
display it when people go to look at

823
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,429
their own account information so that's

824
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,490
a use right I'm like well I mean yeah I

825
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,289
guess the way I just define use for you

826
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,909
that that is a use because you are

827
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,740
displaying it but I don't think it's a

828
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,090
useful use we don't need to tell the

829
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,230
person we asked their Twitter handle

830
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,909
what it was what their Twitter handle is

831
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:28,740
and then do nothing else with it it's

832
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,179
not necessary to have it it presents a

833
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,799
risk to that user if your software ever

834
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,269
gets hacked in their installation

835
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,590
they're just more data that was

836
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,139
collected for literally no reason this

837
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:39,899
happens all the time so you just don't

838
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,190
ask for that information if you're not

839
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,460
actually going to use it have a reason

840
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,990
right to access review processing of

841
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,820
data in a time so if you are

842
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,110
building software that acts

843
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,760
automatically on other people's data

844
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,340
perhaps the sends out you know you sign

845
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,800
up for some kind of process discussion

846
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,150
forum and keep coming back to this is an

847
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,800
example you also have a mailing list

848
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,230
feature on it make it easy for people

849
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,210
who are in your system to find out what

850
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,100
you did with their system right so most

851
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,960
servers now have got audit logs that are

852
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,580
built into it a lot of them are gonna

853
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,170
keep track of when you send outgoing

854
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,030
emails especially if it's for some kind

855
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,220
of marketing campaign and I know there's

856
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,600
Foss software out there helps you deal

857
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,360
with this and the people who are sending

858
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,770
out those emails want to know if other

859
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,000
people read them or at least that the

860
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,680
emails were sent if for no other reason

861
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,300
you want to know you sent this person an

862
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,030
email yesterday when you run that cron

863
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,710
job tonight don't send it to them again

864
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,460
so we've got that data there but do you

865
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,310
let the person who received that email

866
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,630
know that you sent them that that email

867
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,670
like make it easy for them to see what

868
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,020
you did with their data I'm like okay I

869
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,240
signed up for the discussion forum and I

870
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,820
keep getting emails and you know I think

871
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,650
it comes from this company can I go and

872
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,130
see

873
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,600
oh yeah look there's actually sending me

874
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,010
emails they send me emails every two

875
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,330
weeks let them know what you're actually

876
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,610
doing with their data now again this is

877
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,500
going to be context specific right so

878
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,760
you've got to think about it in the

879
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,640
context of your Foss offt where of how

880
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,940
does my compute my program process data

881
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,400
what can I let people opt in and out of

882
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,350
and when I'm processing it is there some

883
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,240
way that I can make that information by

884
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,270
default accessible to the people whose

885
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,740
information is being held inside the

886
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,670
software these three I think are all

887
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,170
kind of the same I'm sure everyone the

888
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,370
rooms heard of the right to be forgotten

889
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,320
even people in United States know about

890
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,580
the right of time because it made a big

891
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,250
splash a couple years ago the right

892
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,360
could be forgotten is going to be

893
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,910
enshrined codified in the gdpr it is

894
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,830
codified in the GD P R but along with

895
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,540
that is the right to update incorrect

896
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,930
data for free and the right to have the

897
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,520
data only stored for a limited period of

898
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,500
time right so I mentioned this to some

899
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,820
of my friends are some of my co-workers

900
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,950
the company I work at who are big into

901
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,420
Drupal and I said you know so for

902
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,670
example right to have your data delete

903
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,110
it if someone goes into your blogging

904
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,270
software community software and says

905
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,010
given the option to delete their own

906
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,710
account because why not right you gave

907
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,880
me option to make their own account

908
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,350
maybe they want to leave the community

909
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,520
give them the option to delete the

910
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,430
account

911
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,930
and when you give me after to the

912
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,640
account actually delete the account and

913
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,320
the response I got back from when the

914
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,210
jury was like oh yeah I think we had a

915
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,930
Drupal ticket open for a couple years

916
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,160
about how you couldn't actually do it

917
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,810
your account it wouldn't work and I'm

918
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,940
like right you could prioritize that

919
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,920
right if we're writing software because

920
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,570
we respect other people's freedoms we

921
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,880
respect their right of privacy and how

922
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,560
their day is gonna be handled then

923
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,470
prioritize the delete option for their

924
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,030
account so that they have the option of

925
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,680
removing their personal data from their

926
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,990
system now you might think well you know

927
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,520
if you're building the discussion forum

928
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,110
I don't want to interrupt that thread

929
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,310
like are they gonna be able to remove

930
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,620
all their discussion comments well this

931
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,780
is a contextual thing too right so the

932
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,040
right to be forgotten case that

933
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,070
established this sued Google Google was

934
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,660
determined like no you can't actually

935
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,240
make the the the link to the newspaper

936
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,130
article accessible to everyone at least

937
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,770
that easily but the newspaper that wrote

938
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,480
the article they don't have to go back

939
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,890
and delete that article because there's

940
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,170
a different context is it relevant to

941
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,360
your service that that data still exists

942
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,880
it's not relevant ten years on that make

943
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,080
Google make that the first search

944
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,670
results for this person who followed the

945
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,430
lawsuit but the Artic the newspaper that

946
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,630
wrote the article on the other hand

947
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,340
probably has an interest in preserving

948
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,860
the integrity of their archive or what

949
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,300
their newspaper looked like that day

950
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,010
right so when you're looking at your

951
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,390
software you might want to make that

952
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,890
choice of if you've got a discussion

953
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,230
forum is there some way that I can just

954
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,700
maybe I just remove their name but leave

955
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,710
their comment or could you remove their

956
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,090
comment and then just put a note there

957
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,890
that says it was removed if any of you

958
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,780
are reddit users I think you will know

959
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,400
you will have noticed at some point in

960
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,780
time that there are comments on there

961
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,190
where there's no name associated with it

962
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,540
or it's a throwaway account it's kind of

963
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,550
a culture on reddit but you was also

964
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,260
seeing conversation threads where

965
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,580
comments have just been removed either

966
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,560
because someone deleted it or because a

967
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,420
moderator removed it it doesn't actually

968
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,760
hurt the conversation that much you

969
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,380
might kind of wonder what that was right

970
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,110
now but it's possible so think about

971
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,240
that and then if you're really concerned

972
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,350
with strengthening people's privacy

973
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,330
rights maybe you want to be a pretty

974
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,040
kind of aggressive about that if the

975
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,570
person who gets your software wants to

976
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,490
say well you know I kind of want to hold

977
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,530
on to this data a little bit more I'm

978
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,270
not as concerned with privacy rights I

979
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,760
think I've got a reason the onus could

980
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,470
be on them to hold on to the data right

981
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,000
the default could be no we're going to

982
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,180
get rid of your data

983
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,520
if you want to use my software for free

984
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,530
the defaults I'm sending you is where we

985
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,940
remove data when people ask for it so

986
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,350
there's a couple of opportunities queue

987
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,680
that I think the GDP are also creates

988
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,060
the right the data portability and the

989
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,920
right to data export to common format

990
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,770
this is actually when I was reading the

991
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,460
GDP are this is the thing that kind of

992
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,480
inspired me to say oh this is something

993
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,040
I should tell people about because the

994
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,930
word common format I was interested what

995
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,850
that means and I don't I don't know if

996
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,990
there's someone who knows what that

997
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,280
means exactly or if there's an

998
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,190
established body of law on that but it's

999
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,820
not use an international standard right

1000
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,590
it's a commonly used machine readable

1001
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,750
format so if anyone here has tried to

1002
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,170
process a word doc file format before

1003
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,720
docx came out I would probably want to

1004
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,070
say like well that's probably not

1005
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,510
something we generally the commonly used

1006
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,160
machine readable format I guess

1007
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,690
technically Microsoft could do it right

1008
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,080
and then they came out with docx and I

1009
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,429
don't know if that actually meets this

1010
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,719
standard either because the only

1011
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,610
software I know that can parse docx

1012
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,020
still word but ODT exists so maybe

1013
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,580
that's a commonly used machine readable

1014
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,460
format or maybe it's a yam low file or

1015
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,489
CSV files it kind of depends upon this

1016
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:30,530
but this isn't just about Word documents

1017
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,590
right this is about all software you're

1018
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,120
operating and personal data right so

1019
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,790
Facebook at least in the schrems case

1020
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,310
max trims who kind of invalidated the EU

1021
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,440
relation data sharing relationship in

1022
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,000
the United States when he asked for his

1023
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,010
data from Facebook he got something like

1024
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,399
50 pages of PDFs of his Facebook account

1025
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:51,020
that was all the data he had on him I

1026
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,940
don't think anyone's gonna seriously

1027
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,510
contend that a PDF file is a commonly

1028
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,300
used machine readable format for like a

1029
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,280
blogging network that maintains social

1030
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,960
relationships right how easy is it can

1031
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,850
be for him to ask a computer to

1032
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,980
reconstruct his social relationships

1033
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,270
with friends that he had stored in

1034
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,360
Facebook by parsing a PDF file like it's

1035
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,130
gonna be kind of a challenge right so

1036
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,860
this standard doesn't exist the other

1037
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,540
thing that they're asking here is that

1038
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,680
it's going to be an expectation that

1039
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,060
controllers some of these are the

1040
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,140
corporations that are collecting your

1041
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,750
data allow you to move data between

1042
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,510
controllers directly right so it's not

1043
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,470
about

1044
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,060
you have to export the data on to your

1045
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,530
computer which I know Google allows you

1046
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,450
to do now and then if you can find

1047
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,460
someone else that happens to parse our

1048
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,890
file format you can import it into them

1049
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,510
but they want you to be able to move

1050
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,250
data directly right so if you want to go

1051
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,830
from Facebook to Google Buzz or Google

1052
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,260
Plus whatever it's called now you should

1053
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,240
be able to do that right so but that's

1054
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,040
not a standard that exists right now so

1055
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,450
here's the two opportunities that I

1056
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,670
think this creates for Foss one if

1057
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,450
you're able to export your blog from

1058
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,390
Drupal and import into Joomla and bring

1059
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,700
it over to WordPress that looks like a

1060
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,609
commonly used machine readable format to

1061
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:07,160
me right and if you're able to export

1062
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,140
your your blog because I think that's

1063
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,119
basically what Facebook and Google Buzz

1064
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,609
are you're able to export that out into

1065
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,920
your local computer Andry report it only

1066
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,160
into Facebook I'm not sure that they can

1067
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,780
make a good argument at that point of

1068
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,310
well it's a commonly used machine

1069
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,560
readable format because the plaintiff

1070
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,540
can always say in that case like well I

1071
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,070
can move between all these blogging

1072
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,960
software but I can't move between

1073
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,390
Facebook and anyone else or if I can

1074
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,770
move between all these different Foss

1075
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,450
off wares and I can only move between

1076
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,880
Facebook and Google which ones the

1077
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,940
commonly used machine readable format

1078
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,200
now I'm not saying you're gonna win that

1079
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,849
case maybe the judge the lawyer in that

1080
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,440
case will be preceded as long as you can

1081
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,609
move between the most two popular

1082
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:49,550
platforms that's fine but there's a heck

1083
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,349
of a lot better chance of forcing

1084
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,210
Facebook and Google to actually give

1085
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,920
people's data back and let them move

1086
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,390
their data to where they want it to go

1087
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,820
if the community is building a standard

1088
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,580
that they have to meet and if we wait to

1089
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,740
play catch-up I'm pretty sure Google and

1090
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,330
Facebook are not going to make it as

1091
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,820
easy to parse their data it's gonna be

1092
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,500
one of those situations where how easy

1093
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,500
it is to parse a docx format file sure

1094
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,210
it's possible but is it going to show up

1095
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,560
commonly in faust oft where

1096
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,440
so I think I've got a little time for

1097
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:40,890
questions so so this regulation the tube

1098
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,260
just talked about does it only apply to

1099
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,130
EU citizens so the regulation applies to

1100
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,350
controllers who are collecting data on

1101
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,670
EU city and EU subjects but can have a

1102
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,100
situation where like at the moment there

1103
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,560
is about 900 companies in the world on

1104
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,660
both sides of the Atlantic that are

1105
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,140
collecting stuff unknown to you people

1106
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,110
about things that people do online yeah

1107
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,470
so can I have a situation and kind of a

1108
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,890
loophole where European companies can do

1109
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,920
that on US citizens while US companies

1110
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,360
can do that on EU citizens so the

1111
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,040
question was is there a loophole where

1112
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,050
EU citizen itíd States companies can do

1113
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,300
this to EU citizens and EU companies can

1114
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,320
do it to American citizens so the common

1115
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,700
the more common case that people are

1116
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,890
worried about is American companies

1117
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,500
doing this to EU citizens so the GPR is

1118
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,090
actually a regulation about not just

1119
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,620
processing of data but the transfer of

1120
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,540
data too so you're not allowed to

1121
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,360
transfer data outside of the EU

1122
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,710
unless you're complying with these rules

1123
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,840
it also applies to companies doing

1124
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,880
business in the EU right so you can't

1125
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,740
collect data on EU citizens and then

1126
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,330
transfer to the US to do whatever you

1127
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,670
want if you do that you need to have

1128
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,620
some legal mechanism in place that the

1129
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,150
EU has approved that allows that

1130
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,190
transfer there's a couple of different

1131
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,720
agreements in place for that but

1132
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,760
basically they take the EU rules and

1133
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,280
force them on the companies even when

1134
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,300
they're operating outside the EU

1135
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,340
jurisdiction so the one with the United

1136
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,600
States it's in place right now is

1137
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,760
privacy shield the one was in place two

1138
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,650
years ago was called the safe harbor

1139
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,660
safe harbor was invalidated because they

1140
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,890
found that the production provide in the

1141
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,420
United States weren't actually adequate

1142
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,030
so the EU actually does have data

1143
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,810
protection authorities who are

1144
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,670
interested in preventing that loophole

1145
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,300
from occurring

1146
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,670
hello i'm federico from wikimedia italy

1147
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,950
two very concrete examples do you think

1148
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,190
that an organization like the wikimedia

1149
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,620
foundation which runs wikipedia should

1150
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,740
try to apply this sort of standards for

1151
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,150
its users and even though perhaps it's

1152
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,410
not legally forced to and second do you

1153
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,220
think that for instance web server

1154
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,630
software like Apache or Angie's should

1155
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,740
change their practice their defaults for

1156
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,330
things like storing IP addresses in web

1157
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,320
server logs so the first question was do

1158
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,110
you think do I think that the Wikimedia

1159
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,180
Foundation that runs Wikipedia should

1160
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,650
comply with this role even if it doesn't

1161
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,320
apply to them my recommendation would be

1162
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,570
to them is I'm not your lawyer but you

1163
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,710
should ask your lawyer if this does

1164
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,880
apply to you because it's not clear to

1165
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,560
me whether or not you law applies to

1166
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,690
them maybe you need you attorney could

1167
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,680
tell them that basically there's also

1168
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,840
journalism exception and that for the

1169
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,670
most part would apply to most of the

1170
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,320
stuff Wikimedia does but we can either

1171
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,730
does have legal people on the ground

1172
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,420
here so apart from the private use

1173
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,240
exception journalism is generally not

1174
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,980
covered by the gdpr because there's an

1175
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,300
overriding freedom of expression

1176
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,510
interest there this is awfully simple

1177
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,390
flight by the way it's not that it's

1178
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,810
always it depends etc right so and to

1179
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,840
get the question after that the

1180
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,280
publisher of software is not necessarily

1181
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,050
the data processor so the idea of

1182
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,640
privacy by defaults is for example

1183
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,100
putting do not track body photos in

1184
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,510
Apache is not necessarily

1185
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,700
responsabilities Apache foundation but

1186
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,680
an even rules or the patch in real life

1187
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,100
shoot and a DDP are consider consider

1188
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,220
turning on do not track and reduce the

1189
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,980
logging to the minimum the question is

1190
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,050
about what they should do as an interest

1191
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,690
of promoting privacy right now you know

1192
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,160
I configure an Apache server I usually

1193
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,500
choose between combined and what's the

1194
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,559
other log Webster long com

1195
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,599
you know maybe they want to come up with

1196
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,209
a new default option for choosing to

1197
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,469
logging standards that does include IP

1198
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,989
address or something like that so very

1199
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,180
briefly I'm working in that domain for

1200
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,199
one of the European data protection

1201
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,539
authorities I'm happy to take questions

1202
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,269
offline but I wanted to clarify one

1203
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:00,689
point on the territorial scope of the

1204
00:42:00,689 --> 00:42:03,059
regulation because it applies to all

1205
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,789
entities that process data in the EU

1206
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,099
regardless of who are the persons

1207
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,019
concerned there's no limitation to EU

1208
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:12,119
citizens so when the your company is

1209
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,160
here or your organization is here they

1210
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,900
are subject to it we go even if the

1211
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,479
people are American said that that would

1212
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:22,109
be covered in in any case so that just a

1213
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:25,859
simple you just have time for two more

1214
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,279
questions

1215
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,160
how is Europe planning to execute that

1216
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,349
low are they doing audits or so my

1217
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,749
understanding of the and this I do not

1218
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:41,039
understand the European regulatory

1219
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,779
process in general because you can use

1220
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:44,459
still kind of a bureaucratic mystery to

1221
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:47,819
me so ask a European attorney but each

1222
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,529
each member state still is going to have

1223
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:51,539
a regulatory authority which companies

1224
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:54,029
are going to be to some extent at least

1225
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,160
choose which Member States Data

1226
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,239
Protection Authority they want to be

1227
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:00,599
regulated by but the idea is that the

1228
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,339
rules are supposed to be uniform so you

1229
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,469
shouldn't be able to forum shop by going

1230
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:05,729
to the forum that interprets the rules

1231
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,759
more lastly how that actually occurs in

1232
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:11,670
the EU as an American journey that kind

1233
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,319
of confuses me because in America we

1234
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,839
would actually kind of encourage the as

1235
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,069
the structure of our system kind of

1236
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:19,499
encourages forum-shopping so it's not

1237
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:20,910
something I exactly understand how

1238
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:27,029
that'll work I just took not really

1239
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:29,509
question just two comments about your

1240
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:34,469
presentation first it's maybe you

1241
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:36,509
haven't mentioned but all the practice

1242
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:39,779
that you recommend and that I think some

1243
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:43,439
of them is quite good can be summarized

1244
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,959
under the concept of privacy by design

1245
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,490
that is

1246
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,359
the idea that when you design a software

1247
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,750
you should in the process of designing

1248
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,490
the software and so in the process of

1249
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,280
coding it over in mind the gtp are

1250
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,500
protecting the privacy of your users you

1251
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,020
intended users and make sure that

1252
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,599
everything is following this state of

1253
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,990
mind so for example anonymizing when

1254
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,050
possible and so on and so on and second

1255
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,500
comments about the question of how to

1256
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,460
apply this that's still touch still a

1257
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,309
big question among lawyers of course and

1258
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:35,640
technician in in member state but one of

1259
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,589
the thing is the idea to have a privacy

1260
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:43,589
impact assessment and that is a risk

1261
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:49,380
based approach you didn't detail this

1262
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,720
approach but many what does it mean it

1263
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,069
means that when you when you design your

1264
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,400
software before design before designing

1265
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,880
of course you need to ensure that every

1266
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,380
good practice for protecting privacy is

1267
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,119
is button but also the risk that is

1268
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,380
minimized so what is the risk for users

1269
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,319
that use your software to to be subject

1270
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,369
to a violation of privacy for example if

1271
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:25,950
if you forget to make an initiation for

1272
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,530
some personal data of course this kind

1273
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,000
of practice will will higher the level

1274
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,130
of risk for your users and of course it

1275
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,940
it doesn't it's not very compatible with

1276
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,650
the idea of privacy by design thank you

1277
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,109
I apologize we're out time I know

1278
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:49,369
they're more questions from mark Wiebe

1279
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:50,749
mark if he went a step into the hallway

1280
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,190
people could continue to ask you

1281
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,120
questions thank you very much

1282
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,239
[Applause]
