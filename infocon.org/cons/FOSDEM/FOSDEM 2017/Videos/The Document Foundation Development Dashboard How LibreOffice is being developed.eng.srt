1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,319
good afternoon

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,430
I'm going to talk about something that

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,460
is the result of a period of several

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,280
months and several years I would say

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,600
from the moment we started to talk about

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,130
this and to the moment we started to

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,230
deploy it some four stems ago we have

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,630
started to talk to some people of the

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,759
open documentation about having a

10
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,099
development - word for LibreOffice and

11
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,950
all the other places around the open

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,969
document foundation umbrella and

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,079
basically we're a company that they're

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,520
producing free software for doing this

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,170
kind of analysis I'm going to present it

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,449
later so at some point we reach an

17
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,789
agreement and we deployed the first

18
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,010
version of the task which is with now

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,390
it's online and I'm going to tell you

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,640
the world right now so there are two

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,859
talks now by myself one is this one

22
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,140
which is basically for explaining how

23
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,120
the dashboard works and the second one

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,289
is probably more interesting because

25
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,809
it's about how they work they work how

26
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,199
the password is that internally and how

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,580
you can call it directly on the data

28
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,440
because right now we have four three

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,930
data sources of your development we have

30
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,030
all the information stored into a nice

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,009
elastic search database that can be

32
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,990
queried in any way you may want so that

33
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,670
means that probably on some of the

34
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,990
metrics that some of you could be

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,880
interested in having are only a couple

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,299
of SQL three elastic search queries away

37
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,100
for you so let's go to the real thing

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,600
first of all I'm going to briefly talk

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,670
about some context about myself and the

40
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,350
company and then I'm going to talk about

41
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,659
the dashboard and I'm going to spend the

42
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,250
first 20 minutes talking about the

43
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,200
dashboard so the dispersed online as I

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,030
said well let me go on briefly so me

45
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,590
that's my that's my self even when it

46
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,509
doesn't look like I'm bought at the

47
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,920
University and at the companies I've

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,270
been working in software matrix for a

49
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,310
while but my approach to software matrix

50
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,899
is not looking at the source code but we

51
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,520
can add activity and the processes

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
that's what does worries about so some

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,299
time ago we decided to start a company

54
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,729
and the company is basically producing

55
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,070
and using only free software and that's

56
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,020
what we used to deploy that the data a

57
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,020
sport in the dust breeze here so here

58
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,000
you have the link you can test the thing

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,840
life if you want and if you try it with

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,140
phone it doesn't render

61
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,690
but try it with the tablet or with a a

62
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,270
laptop it's that's word document

63
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,670
foundation.org so it was a daily like

64
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,680
yesterday so all the of the information

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,000
um I guess it's pretty up today and

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,930
there are several views for the

67
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,900
information first of all we have like

68
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,810
three rows in the main entry point were

69
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,480
which each one corresponds to one of the

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,450
data sources you have kid you have

71
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,660
turret and you have bot Silla and then

72
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,780
on the left you have numbers which are

73
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,190
summaries of what's happening in the

74
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,870
program now and then you have two

75
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,390
columns this is about activity so that's

76
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,930
commits code reviews or tickets and this

77
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,930
is about persons so that all sorts of

78
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,900
commits that people start in code review

79
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,560
processes and this is people opening

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,450
their tickets and then you have some

81
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,430
summaries on the right they have listen

82
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,540
information is probably not very

83
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,970
accurate yet but still we can have an

84
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,250
area so we with some heuristics based it

85
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,350
on the email address which means that if

86
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,000
basically if you are using a gmail

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
address for instance you are in the

88
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,900
unknown part if you are using a

89
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
corporate email address usually you are

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,580
in in the part of the pie let's go to

91
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,280
the real thing

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,459
which is over here okay nice as I said

93
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,970
this is the main overview of the project

94
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,510
and first of all everything is

95
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,420
actionable so you can click on filter

96
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,100
and more things so for instance you can

97
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,830
rearrange the icons somehow you can

98
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,450
remove one of them if you don't want to

99
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,750
see it you can also enlarge them if you

100
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,160
want to make more clearly what's

101
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,010
happening and stuff like that and of

102
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,780
course if you don't save anything

103
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,239
happens for the next user and you cannot

104
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,750
save so no problem for that you can

105
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,540
filter and under step so let me go to

106
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,988
the gate panel and I'm going to show you

107
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,510
how to use it very briefly so this thing

108
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,160
that you see on the top of filters saw

109
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,530
those red boxes so we have two default

110
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,960
filters for filtering out empty commits

111
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,970
I mean those commits don't owe Jennifer

112
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,100
and bots for both we have some

113
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,390
heuristics I don't know how good they

114
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,510
are for this but basically they can be

115
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,410
amended with a manual force in any case

116
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,200
filters can be acted on you can just

117
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
click here and basically it removes the

118
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
filter which means that now the

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,280
information you say once the thing is

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,850
done is basically everything like it was

121
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,040
before bed without the filter so I'm

122
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
going to activate it again and you can

123
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,690
filter by organization so that if you

124
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,880
want to have a look at what Red Hat is

125
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,500
doing in this repository you can very

126
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,290
easily go there trick and filter and now

127
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,300
the thing is the same but now for it had

128
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,000
activity and you can also of course came

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
to any other of the parts like I want to

130
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,540
filter on a specific repositories for

131
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,820
instance this one and I want to check it

132
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,250
specifically what's happening well this

133
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,080
is the formation for some of the things

134
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
there is nothing every time you click on

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,630
something a new filter appears and

136
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,090
filters can be removed with that by just

137
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,710
by clicking on the trashcan which I'm

138
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,730
doing right now okay so this is again

139
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,090
the cool activity for the for the

140
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,650
repository coming back to what's in the

141
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,150
git repository do you have information

142
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,120
about the different authors so probably

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,300
this is a bot that should be filtered

144
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,640
you have organizations over time or you

145
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,610
can have a look at the commit activity

146
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,710
over time and look at who is performing

147
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,180
those commits by affiliation this is

148
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,740
just curious because you know that

149
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,870
engage you have the local time of the

150
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,540
community and all that depends on how

151
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,040
well configured the laptop of the

152
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,410
developer is but otherwise well this is

153
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,440
basically the American West Coast this

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,140
is the East Coast and Lady America this

155
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,280
is Europe and Africa

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,950
this is Asia this is Australia and so on

157
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,620
so you can get first a rough idea of

158
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,080
where your developers are of course if

159
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,210
people have UTC zero in the laptop

160
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,770
because they travel a lot while they are

161
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,900
here that's why this speak here

162
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,869
in any case the information for agate is

163
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,849
not let's say that interesting because

164
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,279
in many cases you already have it maybe

165
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,490
if you came to worried

166
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,930
the information is start to be probably

167
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,180
a bit more interesting this is basically

168
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,990
the number of code reviews for a time it

169
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,490
seems that you started to use your it

170
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,860
intensively at some point in last year

171
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,309
so we can filter out the rest of the

172
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,110
time so on the top lie on the top right

173
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,509
do you have a date filter so I'm going

174
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,550
to get with only with the staff from the

175
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,309
last year and that's fair enough

176
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,599
okay now you can see the code reviews

177
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,219
sorry they could have information as you

178
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,370
have it now and if you look at this one

179
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,009
it is by status if you want to to learn

180
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,370
what status they are here we have new

181
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,740
amend on in March so you have some new

182
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,289
them here so you have some of them don't

183
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,969
know all over the place and most of them

184
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:41,479
are merged

185
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,330
that's number of code abuse right

186
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,309
bye-bye moles of course you can again

187
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,080
click and you can maybe focus on the

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,430
currently open

189
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,459
I mean new code abuse and you can see

190
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,229
how you have new code reviews from last

191
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,529
year but most of them are pretty recent

192
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,050
from the last is now three to two to six

193
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,019
months I'm going to remote that one

194
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,810
then you can of course do the same for

195
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,610
for repository so that you are

196
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,840
interested in what's happening in the

197
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,370
dictionaries repository for instance

198
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,680
this is a code review activity there and

199
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,289
again you can come down and see a bit

200
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,120
more detailed information like the

201
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,189
number of packets per change so how many

202
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,020
people how many times developers has to

203
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,330
resubmit until they get accepted those

204
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,159
are numbers that start to give your idea

205
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,630
about how efficient the process is

206
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,880
because you know if you have a lot of

207
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,890
cycles that basically means that while

208
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,630
the new versions that developers are

209
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,190
sending are not good enough they have to

210
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,198
be reviewed again they have to be asked

211
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,820
again for a new version and that's not

212
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,699
much efficient you can filter by persons

213
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,170
and you can filter a game by by

214
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,339
organizations I'm going to skip some of

215
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,430
the menu entries for out of time but you

216
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,240
can go later

217
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,110
let me check ger it backlog because it's

218
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,670
probably the most interesting one for

219
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,170
developers this is the current backlog

220
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,850
of great issues that we have now right

221
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,949
now so to begin with you can look at the

222
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,820
time structure of those so this is time

223
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,339
and this is the number of Newton sets I

224
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,860
mean ten sets in the new state so as

225
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,130
usual most of them are recent but the

226
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,890
year starts here so you can see this is

227
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,810
very week now so you can see how you

228
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,390
still have some that are two to three a

229
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,370
month old and you have some that are

230
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,589
very old in many cases you may be

231
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,149
interested in learning which ones they

232
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,370
are to go and look at them that's what

233
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,320
you have on the left so on the left you

234
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,260
can go and see okay I have this backlog

235
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,240
and I want to learn what's happening

236
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,980
with this specific for instance this has

237
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,050
been sitting here since March last year

238
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,750
so you can go and click and go directly

239
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,610
to go it and see what's happening with

240
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,800
this one and maybe are deciding to I do

241
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,089
not close sort of been donated or

242
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,670
something so this is probably

243
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,500
interesting staff for learning per

244
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,550
repository

245
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,980
what kind of let's save jobs you still

246
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,600
have pending from the code review point

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
of view of course you can also filter by

248
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,140
who is a million or which organization

249
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,490
is a million or stuff like that so that

250
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,850
you can zero on the kind of information

251
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,810
you may want

252
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,820
issues I mean for Park Sela we have

253
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,920
similar information here you have all

254
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,100
the tickets in the current state and I'm

255
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,050
going to remove the Regent so that you

256
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,700
can see it better I'm going to enlarge

257
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,120
it

258
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,690
have it with maxilla we have some

259
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,130
trouble with the area of treble which

260
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,720
means that the data is ablated only up

261
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,870
to November but still you can get idea

262
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,050
of how you can see the structure of all

263
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,880
the tickets right now how many of them

264
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,860
were closed when you have a ticket

265
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,330
sitting for a long time in such-and-such

266
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,750
state and so on again you can do you can

267
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,570
see the same by you know organizations

268
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,460
poets and mirrors and staff
