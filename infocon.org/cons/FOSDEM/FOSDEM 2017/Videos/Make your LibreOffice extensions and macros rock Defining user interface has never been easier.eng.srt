1
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,719
Green mints enabled

2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,659
come does this work

3
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,440
fair enough so I will I will talk about

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,620
user interface again this time from

5
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,320
slightly different perspective and in

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,879
particular from the perspective of

7
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,340
LibreOffice extensions and macros and

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,790
using the face inside is there anybody

9
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,559
in this room who doesn't know what liber

10
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,199
office extension is everybody knows cool

11
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,449
so I don't have to explain every

12
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,640
presentation has to contain a log cat so

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,549
here is the one fair enough

14
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,870
okay so LibreOffice extensions are one

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,030
of the few things in life or few

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,190
occasions in life when you can have your

17
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,150
cake and eat it too so it's good for the

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,280
easiest users are happy because the

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,470
functionality they need in libreoffice

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,540
is just a few clicks away they can

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,510
install an extension and and I don't

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,450
know use they used a dictionary or like

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,730
have some functionality available that's

24
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,240
not in core by default and the core

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,570
developers are at least not unhappy

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,790
because the core is not polluted by all

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,860
the functionality that is that is used

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,060
by only limited group of people there

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,850
are some more critical views of this

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,890
topic and if you want to hear them there

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,990
will be a presentation like stanchions

32
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,200
about now related so I suggest that you

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,010
see that as well

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,430
so once upon a time when I see there was

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,970
a user who came in and asked that he is

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,970
writing a Python macro and now he wants

37
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,760
to open a dialog from this macro and

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,099
he's using quite cute and the

39
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,170
LibreOffice freeze a so so what can they

40
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,230
do

41
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,920
and this is what I thought like using

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,580
using an external UI toolkits in

43
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,700
combination with LibreOffice is really

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,370
not a good idea but like what can you do

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,070
sometimes you if you write an extension

46
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,850
or just a small macro it needs some user

47
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,770
interaction you need to ask user a

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,810
question or have them choose from

49
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,490
multiple options so you need to have

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,250
some means how to how to define user

51
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,040
interface how to add some dialog so

52
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,170
rather user interface elements into your

53
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,560
extensions and fortunately labor office

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,380
comes with a rather advanced set of

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,920
tools to do just that and here is some

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,960
brief list of the user interface

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,540
elements that you can you can add from

58
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,670
the extensions and macros

59
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,970
I did not include notebook bar because I

60
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,370
was not sure if it's possible to use

61
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,530
note apart from the extension but I

62
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:34,010
don't think it is so far okay so you

63
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,380
want to define a dialog how can you do

64
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,630
that for example like this you probably

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,739
don't want to do this this is some very

66
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,720
very best Java code I I forgot to

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,570
specify so this is taken from from the

68
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,730
libreoffice developer's guide and it

69
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,620
creates the dialog in this very very

70
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,810
best way and that's all the controls on

71
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,640
the fixed positions with the fixed size

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,680
and you really don't want to do that

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,590
another way this looks like an xml

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,380
slightly less verbis and it defines the

75
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,290
dialog that just contains some I think

76
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,820
it's a combo box and that's it but if

77
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,640
you don't want to write XML manually

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,030
there's another some end of 20 beginning

79
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,940
of 21st century way to do that in a

80
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,120
user-friendly way that even like a

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,020
non-technical user can

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,410
have to have to define the user

83
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,690
interface or dialogue in an extension

84
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,960
and I will show that now so the tool for

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,130
that is hidden behind tools macros and

86
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,199
it's this organized dialogues menu I

87
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,270
will choose some here you can see some

88
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,160
some lists of dialogues I already have

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,830
so this template changer is some some

90
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,599
extension eysan I have already installed

91
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:07,539
I will I will show the dialog it defines

92
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:14,599
so now I click edit and I have how do we

93
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,349
move this

94
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,909
anyway this is some some kind of kind of

95
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:35,729
a something kind of dialogue here in the

96
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,960
toolbar I can I can drag and drop and at

97
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,809
the controls here I hopefully I can't

98
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:49,319
yes so I can I can add conscience like

99
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,699
this I can move them around hopefully

100
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,770
yeah I can move them around

101
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,550
I can I can define their properties here

102
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,300
in the in this kind of pain for example

103
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I don't know I can change the font

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,400
and then I can have a look if I'm if I'm

105
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,039
happy with the result and I can see a

106
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:28,680
lame preview like this so then they are

107
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,900
also like further options to say for for

108
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,919
every control in the dialogue you can

109
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,319
you can define an interaction you can

110
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,419
connect it to some macro or to some

111
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,729
function that you'll be executed when

112
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,069
this event happens so for example in

113
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,810
this particular extension there's the

114
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,360
some file chooser or some some text

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,979
field right where I can enter the file

116
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,919
name and what I see over there this

117
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,960
template changer dot something something

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,990
is a link to the macro in my module that

119
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,979
or some some subroutine or a function in

120
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,830
the in my library that will be executed

121
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,310
when this event happens and what I

122
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,919
consider to be absolutely killer feature

123
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,310
of this dialogue designer is how how

124
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,300
easily can a localization be added so by

125
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,710
clicking on this globe globe icon I can

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,029
I can define languages so so in my case

127
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,800
German is the default language of this

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,370
extension so with no localization

129
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,449
localization no other language he said

130
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,759
it the user interface will be in German

131
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,750
and I have one more language here and I

132
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,849
can add multiple languages from this

133
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,879
choice of choice of available languages

134
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,789
and then when I want someone to localize

135
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,830
or read when the translator wants to

136
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,889
localize dialogue they can just switch

137
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,779
between the languages using this list

138
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,629
box and then whatever whatever they

139
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,090
added here the text they adhere in this

140
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,669
this properties editor will be added to

141
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,039
the translation or to the local file for

142
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,590
that language then you simply say the

143
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,259
thing and forward it to do the extension

144
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,360
also and then they have a nice new

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,889
localization of your dialogue

146
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,180
okay but nobody's perfect and neither is

147
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,670
this way of adding dialogues to your

148
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:37,240
user extensions here you can see why so

149
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,820
those dialogues are not resizable every

150
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,340
control is placed on the fixed position

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,360
and has a fixed size that means if you

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,430
design dialogue in this way you have to

153
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,680
optimize for the for the most very best

154
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,470
translation you can get and still you're

155
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,450
not safe because like the controls can

156
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,750
get cropped and things can go wrong

157
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,460
but if you have been around libre office

158
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,520
development for a couple of years then

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,440
you will remember that some three years

160
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,260
ago we solved exactly this problem and

161
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,910
Liber of his court in a way that the UI

162
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,520
the new xml format for the definition of

163
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,070
dialogues was introduced it was this UI

164
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,770
format the dialogues were might layout

165
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,190
to where and yeah they were are now

166
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,300
resizable and and somehow like better

167
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:38,729
positioned and that it organized so

168
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,839
so here's some how do you days away now

169
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,520
how to how to do that in the in

170
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,250
deliverers extensions as well it's a

171
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,190
proof of concept it's not finished it

172
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,339
just exists in my private branch but the

173
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,560
idea is to have this modern dialog

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,860
format the UI format those dialogues to

175
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,200
be loadable also from the extensions as

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,720
well and there's a couple of steps how

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,520
to get there the first three of them are

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,270
done already the first step is that we

179
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,190
accept the UI far or we are able to open

180
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,380
the UI file from just about everywhere

181
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,649
the extension the zip package and the

182
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,470
URL because like the previously it was

183
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
only possible to there was this a suffix

184
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,910
s office dot CFG folder hard-coded so so

185
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,760
this is this is no longer the case that

186
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,130
is hard-coded then the next step was to

187
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,500
create a small you know component that

188
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,899
would that would open this dialog it

189
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,730
would be welded that's the technical

190
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,760
detail that would be derived from this

191
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,550
executable dialog and then the next step

192
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,880
is to well I mentioned those those user

193
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,120
interactions and tying various events of

194
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,209
use interface to the to the macros or to

195
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,209
do two functions so this is also

196
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,279
possible to do that in Glade if you know

197
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,350
Glade there you can it's the signal

198
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,050
element of the UI file where you can

199
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,540
define what's going to happen when user

200
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,820
clicks the button or the focus leaves

201
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,000
the control or those things so the

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,279
parser or the reader of those UI files

203
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,649
was extended to read those signals and

204
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:28,740
now the most hard part of that is

205
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,750
actually like to read those signals and

206
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,240
see to have the controls actually to do

207
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,750
something so this is this is not done

208
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,290
yet and well couple of pipe dreams is

209
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,410
that I will I will go couple of slides

210
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,029
back because I forgot about a slight

211
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:50,190
hope no I don't have it there anymore

212
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,790
nevermind

213
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,220
so there's very convenient way how to

214
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,259
access those controls in basic a couple

215
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,100
of convenient functions so well see what

216
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,589
I've tried so far is that I I loaded

217
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,230
this dis UI code from from the from the

218
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,069
Java code

219
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,139
there's no convenience access methods to

220
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,999
the - opening the dialogue on to the

221
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,189
controls like in the basic currently has

222
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:20,019
and one thing I feel sorry about that if

223
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,049
we if we load those you iack files from

224
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,929
the extensions we will use this killer

225
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:27,579
localization feature it will no longer

226
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:31,149
be possible to add localization industry

227
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:36,160
via LAN easy way so that's about it and

228
00:12:36,160 --> 00:13:23,949
I have yes so in this in the small you

229
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,720
know component I have for just this like

230
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,029
scope V sale pointer and then dialogue

231
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:31,350
execute it only opens the dialogue and

232
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,100
then would I

233
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,679
III did not get that far I thought I

234
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,480
would I would I would somehow there

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,429
would be some crawler of this vcl

236
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,499
builder and that would build this X

237
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:43,480
dialogue model out of those those

238
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,799
controls that are inside

239
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:25,430
I think that's not of interest to

240
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,930
everybody so we can maybe talk about

241
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:36,430
that like yeah well I'm currently like

242
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,410
the motivation like why I did this that

243
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,670
like I wrote in delivery of his

244
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,070
extension and then some very important

245
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,350
managing my job came and complained

246
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,220
oh the text is cut off do something and

247
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,840
I thought I can't do something he's a

248
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,960
little sick sighs fixed position and

249
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,370
then I thought like it would be it would

250
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,470
be great to to open those those UI files

251
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,910
fortune unfortunately like I can just

252
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,040
open them and close them that's nothing

253
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,260
but for the purpose I needed that

254
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,800
it was enough fair enough thank you

255
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:18,380
[Applause]
