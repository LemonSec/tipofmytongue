1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,869
last talk

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,180
so Martin decided to put this in

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,490
academia and actually this is more of a

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,670
hobby of of an actual work so what we

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,170
wanted to work with with my colleague

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,869
and Rico rebuild out is using very high

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,779
stability clock source which is the DCF

8
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,390
77 low frequency a very low frequency

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,560
emitter in Germany for measuring

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,129
ionosphere altitude variations and that

11
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,780
was actually decided during one of our

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,420
barbecue party in the lab when enrico

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,460
was discussing with me about his PhD on

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,820
measuring Lawrence II signals and being

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,460
able to separate the ionosphere ik wave

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,070
from the surface ground propagating wave

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,739
so basically what we wanted to say is

18
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,530
okay he did this like 25 30 years ago as

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,780
a PhD can we do it nowaday with a sound

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,670
card so that was the original insight

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,860
into this topic and maybe some of you

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,210
remember that a couple of years ago I

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,629
discussed GPS reception now GPS is a bit

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,729
challenging because it's below terminal

25
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,649
noise you cannot see it on a spectrum

26
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,930
analyzer but the basic insight was that

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,420
if you could collect the raw carrier

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,859
signals from GPS

29
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,990
well GPS is basically a collection of

30
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,109
atomic clocks in the space and you could

31
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,329
do some nice physics so a bit later now

32
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,140
a lonely sake here from from tests has

33
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,149
published in one of his reviews what

34
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:31,030
physics you can do on GPS usage and this

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,749
is all based on GNSS SDR so basically

36
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:37,210
what the insight in this work is if you

37
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,770
have a very high stability clock and

38
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,149
because frequency is a physical quantity

39
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:41,469
that you can measure with the highest

40
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,270
resolution then maybe you can do

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,880
something fun and so in this context

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,090
what we wanted to look at is looking at

43
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,479
DC f77 as a signal source that is locked

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,329
or disciplined on the PCBs of a German

45
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,200
national metrology Center atomic clocks

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,979
season clocks

47
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,889
and actually that was all started during

48
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,590
the EFTA a European frequency and time

49
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,479
similar that is organized in bazan song

50
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,729
every summer when Andrea's Bower

51
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,800
actually the acknowledgement is is here

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,560
below showed us one of these slides

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,650
where he was presenting the code system

54
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,390
that was

55
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,400
implemented in DCF 77 so you might know

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,770
that DCF 77 is one of these a radio

57
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,000
frequency emitter that allows you to

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,120
synchronize some of his low-cost weather

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,050
station clocks and this is just on by

60
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,010
amplitude modulation I'll show you a bit

61
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,380
later but what andreas showed during his

62
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,570
presentation was that if you just look

63
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,920
at the carrier with his amplitude

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,630
modulation you have a narrowband signal

65
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,950
which is basically just the timing

66
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,080
signal once every second and you're not

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,270
going to do good positioning with this

68
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,520
because you have a very highly stability

69
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,230
frequency but your timing capability is

70
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,420
very poor because nothing looks more

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,130
similar from one sine period than

72
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,450
another sine period so you have no

73
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,850
timing capability and what they did at

74
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,550
ptb are the people working running DC

75
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,459
f77 is that they are added absurd a

76
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,730
random phase noise over the carrier

77
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,800
which is amplitude modulated and when

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,690
you've been working for a year on GPS

79
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,310
and reading all the documentation of GPS

80
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,650
but just jumps on you as as a typical

81
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,150
spectrum spreading using phase

82
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,709
modulation and to the random phase

83
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,450
modulation so when we had a look at this

84
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,040
with Enrico we said we have to try to do

85
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,230
this and do this as easy as possible so

86
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,300
what we want to do here is to have

87
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,060
access to the raw signal from this year

88
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,970
77 and implement not the basic amplitude

89
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,830
modulation detection that everyone has

90
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,140
been doing maybe but the more fancy

91
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,989
phase modulation detection and why did

92
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,340
we do this well if you look at the

93
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,350
literature it's been very well known and

94
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,820
I think that people are forgetting this

95
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,320
little bit actually I have never been

96
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,180
introduced to this before this work is

97
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,190
that in the 60s people were very much

98
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,480
interested in very low frequency

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,980
propagation they were looking at RNA

100
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,750
sphere altitude because they have these

101
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,400
waves are bouncing or valence here and

102
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,350
if you look in the older literature you

103
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,780
see that between daylight and nighttime

104
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,390
sorry nighttime and daytime

105
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,610
ionosphere changes altitude because

106
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,100
ionization due to cosmic rays from the

107
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,190
Sun will change the electron density in

108
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,959
the atmosphere and basically you have a

109
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,269
twenty kilometer altitude variation in

110
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,000
addition to reflection capability change

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,660
due to electron density so what we want

112
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,150
to do here in this work is we have this

113
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,260
very high stability

114
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,690
clock source located manthang in Germany

115
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,570
and we are locating those on some 370

116
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,060
kilometers

117
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,120
away and we have this beautiful season

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,220
locked oscillator that generates a

119
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,340
carrier wave with a 50 kilowatt emitter

120
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,350
and we wonder whether we could do

121
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,940
something more interesting than simply

122
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,490
synchronizing a weber station clock by

123
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,230
looking at the time of flight of this

124
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,720
wave and this requires of course

125
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,000
accurate timing because carrier

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,919
frequency is one story but if you want

127
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,780
to do some timing you need to have some

128
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,150
sort of time of flight measurement and

129
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,760
this is where the carrier phase

130
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,980
measurement will be involved so just to

131
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,450
get an order of magnitude what are we

132
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,740
looking for we're considering GCF 77 370

133
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,250
be 370 kilo meter away from me a ground

134
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,810
wave propagating around hundred

135
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,790
microsecond if you make this wave bounce

136
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,340
of the ionosphere it will take another

137
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,380
hundred microseconds additional to go to

138
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,900
the atmosphere and back to me and if the

139
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,880
ionosphere moves by our twenty kilometer

140
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,850
you could expect some variation of day

141
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,950
to night variation of about an

142
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,570
additional ninety five microseconds so

143
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,020
our question is can we time the signal

144
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,850
generated by this year seventy seven

145
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,250
were received in in the zone zone by

146
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,530
better than or much better than one

147
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,850
hundred microseconds let's wait so

148
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,000
question with a few approximation we

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,090
consider that the wave is propagating at

150
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,340
velocity in in a vacuum and you presume

151
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,560
that the ground wave is delay is

152
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,910
negligible with respect to what we're

153
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,070
looking at so that's really the

154
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,830
objective of this work so the first

155
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,210
thing I would like to introduce I know

156
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,590
this is not a topic session about

157
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,780
antennas but again for someone who's

158
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,330
been raised with VHF antenna microwave

159
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,270
antenna for me an antenna is a 50 ohm or

160
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,150
75 ohm piece of wire which is usually

161
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,220
resonant and when you go back to this

162
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,470
free kilometer wavelength signal any

163
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,479
antenna will be much much shorter than

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,010
the wavelength and if you go back in the

165
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,020
literature you know or you might find

166
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,479
that such antennas are necessarily high

167
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
quality factor antennas which for

168
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,580
someone raised in VHF and s HF is

169
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,080
usually a poor thing you don't like high

170
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,450
resonance antenna because they are

171
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,280
narrowband and usually we want wideband

172
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,190
signals to have a lot of signal a lot of

173
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,650
information content like Shannon told us

174
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,960
and so on the one hand we have these

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,770
narrowband

176
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,080
but actually narrowband is good for SDR

177
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
because narrowband in ser will allow you

178
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,940
to select only one signal and get rid of

179
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,770
all the very old the very low frequency

180
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,229
signals that might prevent us from

181
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,900
receiving easier 77 so we have this high

182
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,509
quality factor antenna which is simply a

183
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,419
coil which is made resonant the other

184
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,340
thing that is not usual to us or at

185
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,680
least to me is that these antennas are

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,629
very high impedance if you calculate the

187
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,069
impedance at anti resonance of the

188
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,509
system its hundred seventy five hundred

189
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,330
twenty five kilo ohm so you need another

190
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,229
adaptation see circuit so just feel the

191
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:23,120
effect transistor that has a very high

192
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,470
impedance that will generate a low

193
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,210
impedance output and which you can feed

194
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,949
directly to a sound card of your PC now

195
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,800
if you do this in the lab well you get a

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,750
lot of signals basically because your

197
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,080
cathode ray screen is generating signal

198
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,659
you're switching supplies generating

199
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,430
that was a fridge discussion this

200
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,289
morning so you need to take antenna out

201
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,979
door so you go through emergency exits

202
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,190
out door that gate gets out of my lab

203
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,979
put the antenna outside and if I put the

204
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,599
antenna like three five kilo meter away

205
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
from the lab then I get my signal from

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,569
DC f77 so at least we first spec to GPS

207
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,849
with DC f77 I can take a spectrum

208
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,199
analyzer and just have a look at the

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,719
signal and I see it so now I have a

210
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,009
signal I want to decode it so I steal a

211
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,029
lot in amplifier from one of my

212
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,520
colleagues I take a synthesizer and I

213
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,550
simply generate 70 70 70 7.5 kilohertz

214
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,279
but DC at 77 carrier frequency and

215
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,229
surely enough on the oscilloscope I see

216
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,090
my amplitude modulated signal these are

217
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,370
the amplitude drops every once every

218
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,860
second and I have the phase information

219
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,620
which comes out of a lock-in and because

220
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,089
there's no reason for this receiver to

221
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,208
be locked to a cesium clock the local

222
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,979
oscillator of this which this

223
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,929
synthesizer has no reason to being

224
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,510
locked on the cesium of course you have

225
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,029
a phase which depends on the thing we

226
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,480
want to decode plus a time varying

227
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,490
signal which is a frequency offset as

228
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,500
we've just seen but because I'm in a

229
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,089
time and frequency lab I'm lucky enough

230
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,920
to have access to a cesium clock so now

231
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,810
I take a cesium clock I lock the

232
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,459
synthetizer on a seasoned clock and

233
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,650
surely enough

234
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,900
ptb has a season Club which is locked to

235
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,330
the business observatory club of course

236
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,589
these two clocks are used to generate

237
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,470
time so these are synchronized or at

238
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,870
least they have a very slow drift so

239
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,580
basically we can get amplitude

240
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,100
modulation phase modulation and this is

241
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,650
just my locking output my lock-in

242
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,510
amplifier output there is not much I can

243
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,150
do out of it so I take this on an

244
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,680
oscilloscope I grab the oscilloscope

245
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,580
signal and by recording the raw signal

246
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,440
from DC at 77 can I extract amplitude

247
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,970
phase and if I get the phase because I

248
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,710
do a cross correlation so that I can

249
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,970
recover my total random information so

250
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,160
here is the pseudo random code that has

251
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,230
been added on top of VCF 77 carrier so

252
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,450
it's a proto and emits a 511 bit so it's

253
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,210
very similar to GPS GPS is 10 bit this

254
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,339
one is 9 bits so the random means that

255
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,770
it doesn't repeat over these 511

256
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,279
sequence and you have a plus or minus 13

257
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,100
degree phase variation as opposed to GPS

258
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,709
which is 100 plus or minus hundred zero

259
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,050
180 this is just a very tiny phase

260
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,709
variation plus or minus 13 degree so you

261
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,220
generate this code this is stolen from

262
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,130
DCF 77 web page from Wikipedia you

263
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,410
generate the code you load the code your

264
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,390
recent pull your signal to have as many

265
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,700
ones and 0 as you have samples in each

266
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,310
bits you cross correlate and surely

267
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,680
enough this is one of your Eureka day

268
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,080
where everything works nicely once every

269
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,700
second you've got one of these Peaks

270
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,529
coming out cross correlation peak and

271
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,570
you might say no this is just noise well

272
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,160
if you zoom into one of these Peaks you

273
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,800
have a real cross correlation in signal

274
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,380
that is significant so this is an

275
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,290
example of getting the signal by cross

276
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,420
correlating my pseudo-random code over

277
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,130
the phase information that I've recorded

278
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,730
and I can get a nice timing signal and

279
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,110
if you wonder if you wonder why we're

280
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,209
doing this this is the amplitude

281
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,370
modulation I assumed into the amplitude

282
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,320
modulation this is one of my cross

283
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,940
correlation T if you look at this over

284
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,829
one minute this is what you have once

285
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,209
every second you have a drop in

286
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,190
amplitude once every second you have a

287
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,570
cross correlation peak

288
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,590
if you look at them you see that

289
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,690
obviously we're gonna have a much better

290
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,670
climbing accuracy with such a signal

291
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,380
than with this one if you do this over

292
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,210
one minute you see that you have a

293
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,740
beautiful cross correlation peak which

294
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,510
is very narrow and here you have this

295
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,430
broad drop of your amplitude so

296
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,600
basically what has been published

297
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,430
earlier is that you have at least a ten

298
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,770
times ten fold improvement in timing

299
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,600
capability by using the phase cross

300
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,800
correlation as opposed to amplitude

301
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,890
modulation okay so so far I've shown off

302
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,990
with my friends instruments I have an

303
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,610
experiment which is a few thousand zero

304
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,680
and you need a cesium clock quite a few

305
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,450
people here will not be able to Bay to

306
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,530
to perform it so now let's go to

307
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,030
software-defined radio I want to do this

308
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,710
now I have my lucky amplifier with my

309
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,780
cesium locked source and I want to

310
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,760
compare the results with a sound card

311
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,950
and again my sound card has a local

312
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,510
oscillator which has no reason of being

313
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,380
locked on on cesium so I need to compare

314
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,440
my sound card recording with some sort

315
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,300
of time reference and the obvious time

316
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,670
reference is 1 PPS one pulse per second

317
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,530
coming from GPS I have one of these

318
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,960
cheap u-blox

319
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,640
receivers u-blox is a switch company

320
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,280
making very good GPS receivers this is a

321
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,910
4 88 Euro you can get a phase output a

322
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,330
phase lock a GPS receiver which are one

323
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,490
PPS signal which is never late to be

324
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,170
plus or minus 40 nanoseconds so you have

325
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,300
a very good time reference and so again

326
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,070
we do the same thing we have our audio

327
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,540
signal because I have a sound tower that

328
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,760
can record at 192 kilohertz

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,750
I am weaving Nyquist theorem of twice

330
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,200
two samples for 70 7.50 Hertz carrier

331
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,540
frequency I do a frequency translating

332
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,020
filter and I just record magnitude and

333
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,550
phase out of this signal and if I do

334
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,580
this I will try to tune the frequency

335
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,010
translating fear filter so that I get

336
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,250
well i compensate 492 kilohertz offset

337
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,400
from the one two frequency now as I just

338
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,290
mentioned during the session panel one

339
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,490
of the things that always baffles me

340
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,800
with this translating few filter is so I

341
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,740
put plus 77 or minus 77 I always do it

342
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,720
wrong I have to try twice what is the

343
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,250
sine of a frequency offset that you have

344
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,980
to put in frequency filter and somehow

345
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,180
in this case it worked

346
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,600
whatever I put plus or minus 77 5.5 and

347
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,750
this is obvious

348
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,670
once you realize that you've recorded a

349
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,530
real signal this is not an IQ output a

350
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,210
complex output it's a real signal a

351
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,670
signal a real signal is even so you have

352
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,130
the same component on the positive

353
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,630
frequency and the negative frequency so

354
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,630
ever you put plus 77 or minus 77 you

355
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,180
always having end up having one of the

356
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,310
information component into the baseband

357
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,640
and so for this once we can do whatever

358
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,470
we want plus or minus sign and you end

359
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,320
up having a nice signal so you do this

360
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,030
like the first time you do this you get

361
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,640
once every second the amplitude drop and

362
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,410
this is your face face from the

363
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,050
recording and you try playing with this

364
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,790
Delta F that you cannot reach here so I

365
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,370
originally I'm slightly off frequency

366
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,410
with an offset of zero Hertz I try to

367
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,510
move it closer so let's say one Hertz

368
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,910
where so removing this phase offset

369
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,790
we're getting better whoops I went too

370
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,860
far and at the end you can compensate

371
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,180
for the phase offset of due to the

372
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,650
difference between local oscillator of

373
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,220
sound card and this year 77 so 15 ppm is

374
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,600
not too bad is much better than most

375
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,640
dvb-t receivers so now I can get my

376
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,190
phase information and again same story I

377
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,580
have my one PPS one my one pulse per

378
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,560
second from GPS I have my amplitude

379
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
signals somehow I don't know why but if

380
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,060
I do have two sources I get out of sync

381
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,890
sometimes in inverter the graphical

382
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,230
displayed on the Y and the green is the

383
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,960
phase so I don't want I'm going to show

384
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
you I've been running this since October

385
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,680
so I don't want to tune manually the

386
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,870
frequency offsets every time so what I

387
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,780
did here is a very ugly what I'm doing

388
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,550
here is I'm recording using new radio

389
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,870
and when a process in MATLAB I have

390
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,510
easier 14 in octave reverb and then we

391
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,220
work indirectly in C++ so I find it

392
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,080
easier to record the data and then

393
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,000
process them so what I'm doing here is

394
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,510
I'm recording the raw data I'm having a

395
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,030
local oscillator 70 7.50 Hertz and I'm

396
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:25,100
shifting by a discrete-time my DCF 77

397
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,140
signal and I low pass filter Vella

398
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,850
decimate so basically here i reproduce

399
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,010
the translating fir filter that's easy

400
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,080
enough and then what I do is I make a

401
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,660
coarse frequency offset measurement by

402
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,339
taking the magnitude of the free

403
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,530
transform and I say okay by Fourier

404
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,550
transform is going to tell

405
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,080
by how much it's a very rough estimate

406
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,330
but by how much my local oscillator is

407
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,060
offset with respect to DCF 77 and I

408
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,850
remove I create a local oscillator which

409
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,220
is exponential of J 2 pi the the

410
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,410
frequency offset times the discrete time

411
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,980
and I remove this offset and then once

412
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,690
I've removed this chorus frequency

413
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,390
offset I make a linear fit of the phase

414
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,970
the resulting phase and once again I

415
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,130
remove the average value of this linear

416
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,529
feet of a phase which is an accurate or

417
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,839
precise frequency difference estimate

418
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,019
and if I do this I have my my offset

419
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,120
corrected phase information if I cross

420
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,490
correlate this signal I get my beautiful

421
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,230
cross correlation Peaks once every

422
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,329
second so I can do the same thing we did

423
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,550
with a lock-in amplifier with a sound

424
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,890
card and all this will be reference to

425
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,740
the 1 PPS of GPS by recording on a

426
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,600
serial sound card on one channel I

427
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,510
record DC f77 on the second channel I

428
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,769
record GPS and I can measure here the

429
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,740
difference between GPS and one PPS at

430
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,320
some point you sometimes have a slight

431
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,630
offset of the face sometimes you lose

432
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,329
some of these cross collation Peaks and

433
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:52,700
your timing will go away but if you run

434
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,190
a median filter on this thing you will

435
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,620
find the median value and it will give

436
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,839
you a pretty good idea of what the phase

437
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,360
but so the time stamp is at the time the

438
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,569
time delay is and this is an example of

439
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,390
a three-day measurement where I have on

440
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,790
top the lock-in amplifiers of a high

441
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,919
quality high grade lock-in amplifier and

442
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,199
on the bottom this is the output of my

443
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,910
sound card so you see that the results

444
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,740
are pretty consistent you have here

445
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,380
daytime nighttime so indeed I can

446
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,970
measure some sort of situation of the

447
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,650
atmosphere during night time with

448
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,990
respect to daytime and what you cannot

449
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,850
see here below the text is the

450
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,770
resolution the timing resolution is

451
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,110
about nine microseconds if you remember

452
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,720
I was claiming that the daytime to

453
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,580
nighttime variation is about 100

454
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,950
microseconds so we have ten times better

455
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,500
time resolution by using this cross

456
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,610
collation technique so this is what I

457
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,410
want to say here

458
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,890
this was done in September this was my

459
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,929
very first measurement in September I

460
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,450
to live for a free week trip in end of

461
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,149
September October and unfortunately for

462
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,649
you I will not be able to show you any

463
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,869
better result than this because since

464
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:05,059
October it's been winter in winter -

465
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,549
fear is not stable and I have to wait

466
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,529
for a spring to come back to have again

467
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:10,730
these measurements I was hoping that

468
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,730
yesterday maybe the Sun might be helpful

469
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,499
but no not yet we have to wait a few

470
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:18,019
more weeks before the atmosphere shows

471
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,590
again this high stability during daytime

472
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,039
now one of the thing here is that not

473
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,289
everyone has access to 192 he rolled

474
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,049
some cards so of course we all seen that

475
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,149
we have dvb-t receivers and these dvb-t

476
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,759
receivers they also allow me to assemble

477
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,830
a 2 mega sample per second so with 2

478
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,029
mega sample per second

479
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,059
I can timestamp the GPS one PPS with a

480
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,340
much better accuracy because now I have

481
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,519
500 nanosecond resolution however I'm

482
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,519
losing in quantification resolution

483
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,139
because I'm going from a 16-bit sound

484
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,269
tower to an 8-bit a-to-d converter so

485
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,119
will the 8-bit a to D converter from the

486
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,619
RTL 28:42 you be enough to get my signal

487
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,889
out of so my ground wave out of my my

488
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,990
air wave out of my ground wave and we've

489
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,970
seen that the antenna is a high quality

490
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,190
factor bandpass filter so will I be able

491
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,999
to get rid of of a jammer here so we did

492
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,519
this and actually I'm putting this as a

493
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,769
provocation for the Osmo as your people

494
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,110
in the room because I couldn't get the

495
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,090
direct sampling function to work with

496
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,850
the new radio block and so what I did is

497
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,740
was very ugly Hawk I'm sorry but at

498
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,409
least it works is I just put in the

499
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,899
liberality are the fact that I'm using a

500
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,820
four thousand four thousand is a tuner

501
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,749
that is not using intermediate frequency

502
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,799
so by setting your RTR with such a

503
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,659
setting you just tell it recall whatever

504
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:46,129
sample you have and don't put any

505
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:48,980
frequency offset and somehow this works

506
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,200
so if there is a better way to do it I

507
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,820
would like I think this is very powerful

508
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,730
way of using this RTL 2832 you and it

509
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,169
would be nice to ever make sure that

510
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,509
they work or at least find some way of

511
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:01,700
getting people used using them and so

512
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,529
once you get this working you have one

513
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,619
area input which is DC or 77th virtual

514
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,340
input which

515
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,560
the GPS signal and again we do the same

516
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,410
thing I record for one minute once every

517
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,180
once every minute I record for duration

518
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,630
of one minute my simple GPS this year 77

519
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,270
I process my data and I will save them

520
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,730
by doing the same processing I will not

521
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,650
get into details but is exactly the same

522
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,990
story except that you need to do well by

523
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,210
processing a two megahertz signal with a

524
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,460
very narrow band you you are targeting a

525
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,490
700 Cure's bandwidth you realize why you

526
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,500
need to do multiple fear filter with

527
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,270
decimation and again we go back to this

528
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,550
whole DSP thing you can take all the

529
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,410
courses on DSP that you want if you

530
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,270
haven't realized that if you do directly

531
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,250
to megahertz to 700 Hertz you have like

532
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,170
10,000 coefficients and then it's not

533
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,900
going to run efficiently like then you

534
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,640
haven't understood what DSP means and so

535
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,160
by doing this with practical signals you

536
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,170
will realize why you have to cascade few

537
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,840
filters with decimation steps in between

538
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,430
and so you do this again with your art

539
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,060
rtl-sdr and at some point you should

540
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,400
have a chart displayed but there is a

541
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,280
lot of points on this next chart so

542
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,620
recording the data you extract phase

543
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,430
magnitude

544
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,680
again I have my once every second

545
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,510
amplitude information like phase

546
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,600
information my GPS time stamp the face

547
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
which doesn't look very good but at

548
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
least cross-correlation Peaks come once

549
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,990
every second here because I have a bit

550
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,240
of leftover phase drift like I lose my

551
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,300
cross correlation and I get here my my

552
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,220
cross correlation Peaks so again I can

553
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,250
do my time in experiment and I will be

554
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,310
able to get a precise time of timing

555
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,800
time stamping by using dvb-t so even

556
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
some of you who do not have 192

557
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,800
kilohertz sampling audio sound cards you

558
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
can reproduce this with 10 euro worth of

559
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,440
equipment with an RTL SDR don't go and

560
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,980
again by doing this we have a collection

561
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,700
of timing so this is a conclusion of

562
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,170
this has been running since November

563
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,510
this is 6th of November this was done

564
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,880
yesterday so what you see here here I

565
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,680
changed my algorithms so this is just a

566
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
slight change in my goal even so what

567
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,750
you see here is that phase of course we

568
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,840
reference we are referring GPS to a

569
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,360
clock which is used for defining UTC so

570
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,289
these

571
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,330
even though GPS is artificially linked

572
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,240
to UTC to Universal Time well we we have

573
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,950
good reasons to think the GPS will be

574
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,500
synchronized with UTC so what you see

575
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,389
here is over three months you do not see

576
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,190
any observable drift which is well known

577
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,679
from the petrology community and every

578
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,690
one of these dips here is another day so

579
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,200
they night day night which one of these

580
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,299
like this and if I plot an island

581
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,710
deviation for those of you who are more

582
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,120
into the time frequency so this is

583
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,730
basically the stability of my timing

584
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,370
capability as a function of integration

585
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,679
time so this is going from one minute up

586
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,080
to well three months you see that you

587
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,419
are at the ten to a minus seven down to

588
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,570
10 to a minus 11 which is about 1,000

589
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,549
times worse than what has been published

590
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,429
by ptb but I think I've spent much less

591
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,990
than a thousand times less than what

592
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,299
they did it very experiment and just to

593
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,850
give you some hint the red curve here is

594
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,760
a tuning fork this is basically the

595
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,200
stability of your watch

596
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,269
I took a tuning fork from a watch and I

597
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,250
measured the stability so what this

598
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,470
chart tell you is that a tuning fork is

599
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,419
very stable on the short term but on the

600
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,190
long term it's going to drift if only

601
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,320
due to time temperature variation when I

602
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,019
wear although I do not wear my watch so

603
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,850
over time the tuning fork is going to

604
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,130
drift whereas these two clocks that

605
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,789
we're using here the cesium lock clocked

606
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:43,179
generated by this EF is going to always

607
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,710
demonstrate better stability as the

608
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,720
longer you integrate and at some points

609
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,220
you have this intersection course which

610
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,649
tells you that below this your course

611
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,380
watch will be better than DC f77 and

612
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,809
above so sometime you should look at

613
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,149
this year 77 this is basically what

614
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:00,950
cesium atomic clocks are doing you have

615
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,169
high stability from the quartz

616
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:05,090
oscillator on the short-term and you

617
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,010
lock your quartz oscillator on the

618
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,260
atomic transition so basically what you

619
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,179
can do with this sound card is get

620
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,120
acquainted to what people are doing when

621
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,679
they try to design a tuma clock so

622
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,289
having various time sources and these

623
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,450
time sources will give the best ability

624
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,360
over various integration durations so

625
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,010
basically what we showed here is that we

626
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,929
have the ability to receive this EF 77

627
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,510
to see a signal using active antenna we

628
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,649
have been able to extract

629
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,450
amplitude and phase information using a

630
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,159
locking amplifier we've been able to

631
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,030
reproduce this

632
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,720
with ser Iver with no joke sound card or

633
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,830
with dvb-t dongle and we have consistent

634
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,020
results I'm eagerly waiting for a spring

635
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,810
to get again a BAE a beautiful stable

636
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,630
signal I try to correlate fluctuations

637
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,990
in the DCF 77 signal with x-ray density

638
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,730
measured by geosynchronous satellites

639
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,590
from NOAA and there is no obvious

640
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,380
correlation I believe at 70 7.5

641
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,090
kilohertz is a bit too high and we're

642
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,430
probing layers of atmosphere that are

643
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,920
too deep to detect what people are

644
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,750
usually measuring with I assume which

645
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,360
are lower frequency devices 10 15

646
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,860
kilohertz where you really see the

647
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,440
effect of of x-ray density variation on

648
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,160
the ionic content of atmosphere I do

649
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,200
have a few questions though if anyone

650
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,660
wants to pursue this thing we're

651
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,580
supposed to be told that we have two

652
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,890
waves propagating on DLF a ground wave

653
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,480
in an ionospheric wave that was

654
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,310
initially insights that Lawrence C

655
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,780
allows you to distinguish these two

656
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,320
waves and if as published by PT be the

657
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,910
ground wave is much stronger than the

658
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,910
ionospheric wave how come that my unique

659
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,770
signal that I'm measuring is varying

660
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,630
from day to night this is a question for

661
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,210
me and I wonder whether you have to use

662
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,800
a model a waveguide model where we have

663
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,720
varying boundary conditions or whether

664
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,060
you have truly two ways propagating at

665
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,430
the moment I did everything on a PC

666
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,830
whether it's worth spending time putting

667
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,060
all of this in a microcontroller is

668
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,190
questionable but it's kind of fun and

669
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,800
it's not too difficult to do so the next

670
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
thing I would like to look at is

671
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,150
basically looking at the at moment I've

672
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,860
just been looking at the position of a

673
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,620
cross correlation peak but I have not

674
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,150
investigated the shape of a cross

675
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,410
correlation peak and what I would expect

676
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,470
is that either air wave is slightly

677
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,270
shifted with respect to the ground wave

678
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,250
what you should see is a broadening of a

679
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,170
cross correlation peak because you have

680
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,080
two ways slightly timeshifters you

681
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,850
should remember that the phase did is

682
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,490
1.5 milliseconds apart it's 700 Hertz

683
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,520
these are 100 microsecond time delay so

684
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,020
you will not be able to receive a two

685
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,450
cross correlation peak separates but you

686
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,880
should be able to see some sort of cross

687
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,530
correlation peak broadening as a

688
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,160
function of his air wave and ground wave

689
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,840
separation so this is still open to

690
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,040
questions so they

691
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,420
what I want to show you is that you can

692
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,550
get involved in today's electrical

693
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,440
phenomena in atmosphere involved in this

694
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,920
topic while investigating a surface or

695
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,460
software-defined radio just I've put in

696
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,350
a food waste of course the slides on my

697
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,410
website and on the Fordham website there

698
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,470
is there has been a very extensive

699
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,480
literature on this topic but I haven't

700
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,220
seen anyone trying to attack all the

701
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,140
issue of can anyone reproduce the

702
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,700
experiment usually these are very fancy

703
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,950
experiments with rather fancy equipments

704
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,410
and I believe it this is a topic that

705
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,090
would be worth investigating but more

706
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,340
people especially because very low

707
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,340
frequency communication has lost some of

708
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,620
its appeal since everyone is looking at

709
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,260
a tie Bend which propagate transmissions

710
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,890
and nevertheless low frequency is a very

711
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,990
amusing topic so with this I thank you

712
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,730
for staying all the way to the end of a

713
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,830
talk and if there is any question I will

714
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,030
be happy to answer thank you

715
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,670
I know a question just flowed your way

716
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,530
out look around you pick up all the

717
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,910
trash goes in the hallway and go here

718
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,920
don't go is uh actually I heard 20 euro

719
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,830
III buy mine for 8 euros actually this

720
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,110
is just one of these h0 dongles and you

721
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,330
just have to install the two capacitance

722
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:30,640
and put an SMA connector instead what I

723
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,950
it's like the previous presenter I

724
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,450
believe it's in academia we are not

725
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,100
careful enough to make something that

726
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,390
other people can use I will be very

727
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,060
happy to put on the website all my

728
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,130
octave script it might be that you have

729
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,600
to send me an email - I didn't tell you

730
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,640
how it works because we are not very

731
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,050
definitely not plug-and-play but I would

732
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:56,170
be very happy to send them to you we do

733
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,380
so

734
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,600
I have 192 kilohertz sound card I'm well

735
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,240
below half the sampling frequency why

736
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,710
wouldn't my sound card allow me to

737
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:32,390
record this well the fact is it doesn't

738
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,670
tell luckily enough it doesn't okay well

739
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,610
I tried it on the lab is fitted with

740
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,710
Dell laptops I tried it on to Dell

741
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,170
laptops it works and on panasonic

742
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:54,040
laptops it works I have a question yeah

743
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,849
the first time I did this before I was

744
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:27,219
even sure that my pseudo random number

745
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:29,169
generator was correct the first thing I

746
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,149
did was I also created to see if I could

747
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:34,719
get my piece once every second the

748
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,690
question about using directly but

749
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,799
because then once I got my

750
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,149
autocorrelation I wanted a cross

751
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:42,219
correlation to work lack of GPS you can

752
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,719
only get the cross correlation if you

753
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,999
correct for a face and then I for God's

754
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,089
returning back to the autocorrelation I

755
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,769
wonder whether what you can grab out of

756
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:53,349
the autocorrelation it could be but at

757
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,609
some point I want to compare this

758
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,369
autocorrelation with the GPS tag and

759
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:00,399
then I need to have my my copy my local

760
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,009
copy that I will face a line with my

761
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:05,649
with my GPS so at some point by taking

762
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:06,999
external I think the autocorrelation

763
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,589
will tell me whether I got the right

764
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:10,269
signal and whether I get a peak every

765
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,009
once every second but if I want to

766
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,269
synchronize with an external source

767
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,429
which is the one PPS when I need to run

768
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,889
a local copy of my oscillator or my maps

769
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:18,879
random generator

770
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,129
so the random number generator and and

771
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,459
facing furnaces as we do in GPS but

772
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:26,769
autocorrelation is beautiful this is

773
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,359
completely off topic but I was I've been

774
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,829
spending the last three weeks working on

775
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:33,579
our RDS because Bastion tells us that

776
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,109
hard yes is so easy it took me three

777
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,639
week to get it and the first thing I got

778
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:38,619
with the stupid RDS is indeed the

779
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:40,119
autocorrelation and once I got the

780
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,769
autocorrelation I need another three

781
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,419
weeks to figure out how to get the bits

782
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,179
out how to get the vac relation things

783
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,799
autocorrelation is really something that

784
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,450
you should be the first thing tested

785
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,279
whenever - we want to check whether the

786
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,489
signal is integrity is correct so

787
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:56,320
localization is very powerful tool

788
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,700
indeed that's it

789
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,470
[Applause]
