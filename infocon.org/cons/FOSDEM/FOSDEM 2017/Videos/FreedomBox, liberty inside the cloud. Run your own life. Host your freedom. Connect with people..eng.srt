1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,160
ha hi people my name is goober Lewis I'm

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,500
one of the people who's working on

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,910
freedombox and yeah nobody was coming

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,060
here for this year so I thought let me

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,180
do it I'm again not a coder I'm not even

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,180
a slideshow maker so you can see that

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,149
maybe later on because I've got really

8
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,469
good slides like this one yeah that is

9
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:37,150
the main slide to me so the idea for me

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,780
wealth freedom box was I came here to

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,800
force them 2011 and was Adin Moglen with

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,760
the speech white political level depends

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,660
on software freedom more than ever it's

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,160
and 2011 and this strange thing is I

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,950
watched it yesterday again to prepare

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,260
and I was like oh man that could have

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,329
been just today and the the things that

18
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,450
he talks about are really very

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,460
interesting so if you ever have some

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,889
time left try to watch that video again

21
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:23,700
back to the main slide freedom box has

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,950
came into existence because people have

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,179
no real option for security and taking

24
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:34,600
things into their own hand except for

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,880
people like the projects that are

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,340
presented here and I've seen a lot of

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,189
people saying like but there is no way

28
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,880
to do this well there are a number of

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,639
ways that are halfway finished or just

30
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:52,749
begun and begun but we've been working

31
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:55,749
on this for a long time and our idea is

32
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,389
to have a small box that you can buy

33
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:02,700
cheaply just like a raspberry but then

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,709
most likely even more free so there is

35
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,199
the old Emacs from the people downstairs

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,510
and the BeagleBone from Jason Carter and

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,980
it's a big Obon foundation they

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,110
have really open-source hardware not

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,510
only the software and we are Debian pure

40
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,450
distribution the idea about that is you

41
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,140
want to keep everything Debian so when a

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,099
release comes up everything that can be

43
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,920
included has to be part of Debian as

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,750
well well so this time the the freeze is

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,500
just about to start so as a principal I

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,019
can tell you No thank you we cannot use

47
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,599
your work no help needed there's just

48
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,299
one bug that has to be done for the

49
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,000
release of the new stretch and for that

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,660
we're done we've added translations we

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,910
have a pretty okay set of of tools but

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,019
from that Darren

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,599
after stretch there will be Buster and

54
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,870
from there on we can have a lot of fun

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,140
making new tools and build out the

56
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,819
foundation that we have built so on that

57
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:27,470
we do need help so we now have the we

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,959
will be and Debian stretch this will be

59
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,329
the first time that as a Debian pure

60
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:38,209
distribution we will be included and the

61
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,209
other parts that are needed to use it as

62
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,569
a as a tool for yourself are available

63
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,380
now we have the the things to do with

64
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,930
that and the small machines are really

65
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,799
cheap at the moment so the next step

66
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,410
will be adding adding new tools most

67
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,889
likely from Debian and we now have a

68
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,000
blog we have

69
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,129
voice telephone video telephone and XMPP

70
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,769
well most of the things that you would

71
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,500
expect from a project like this and it

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,259
is all runnable from these small boxes

73
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,240
but there is a lot of tools that are

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,720
already in Debian that are not used by

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,509
the project yet and there is a lot of

76
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,020
things that can be included outside of

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,330
Debian that are not even considered by

78
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,479
most of the projects here yet for

79
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,669
instance I personally would like to see

80
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,889
something like ka Lite which is the

81
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,590
offline version of Khan Academy which

82
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,460
normally gives you a lot of education

83
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,710
but informs a lot about your learning

84
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,360
process to Big Data which is none of my

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,550
interest and I don't think they should

86
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,139
be looking at my learning curve as well

87
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,259
so this has not been used by any of the

88
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,930
the host it yourself projects as far as

89
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,180
I know but I personally think it would

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,970
be very interesting to add that to the

91
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,870
normal curriculum because it's not just

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,169
being able to use the code that's made

93
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,669
by everybody but it's also improving

94
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,820
yourself and improving your knowledge

95
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,250
about the world so you can participate

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,870
in a broader way and also what people

97
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,740
keep telling me is it needs things like

98
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,180
theming by now we're just using a Debian

99
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,510
website to controllers and a jungle

100
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,960
website with bootstrap and no theming so

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,849
you know what it looks like that's why I

102
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:58,870
put the demo up here and no yeah so

103
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,729
there is a lot of things to improve but

104
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,690
we have a foundation at this point we

105
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,020
could use a lot of help and translation

106
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,750
although we have a lot of things but a

107
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,969
lot of ways to improve how people use it

108
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,220
and how they could

109
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,289
show it to other people and of course we

110
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,830
try to be a the software for an

111
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,370
appliance for ordinary users it's not at

112
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,860
that level yet we sometimes still need

113
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,800
to use the terminal sometimes they'll

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,819
need to find arcane solutions to do

115
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,879
things that it should be known and done

116
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,610
already but we are getting there and at

117
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,199
this moment we are getting three new

118
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,159
participants that are working full-time

119
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,849
on this there is an Indian nonprofit

120
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,659
that's called thought works and they're

121
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,370
sponsoring the the main developer at the

122
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,599
moment you know a depe and two of his

123
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,979
colleagues to get this only way and so

124
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,050
if somebody helps out there is a lot of

125
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,810
people also helping out and this will

126
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,849
make your contribution be more and use

127
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,539
in an easy way back to the main slide at

128
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,419
this point I would like to say there is

129
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,860
a lot of people saying things like there

130
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,599
is no way what do I have to hide well

131
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,699
the point of that is you don't need to

132
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,169
have something to hide

133
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,560
you have things to protect and people

134
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
telling you you have things to you you

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,719
don't have things side that doesn't

136
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,279
really matter but and the the issue is

137
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,909
who do you want to hide some things from

138
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,639
I've got a friend who told me this last

139
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,880
week and I asked them what exactly do

140
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,120
you not want to hide from chem young ill

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,590
or plum or whoever they should just not

142
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,509
be in your life anyway so that's a

143
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,009
different way of looking at it and

144
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,340
Holland we had a survey about what do

145
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,250
you do and an alligator it was in the

146
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,310
70s and one of the the main conclusions

147
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,990
was crap scratch my ass

148
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,599
and yeah that's something that you can

149
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,070
do when you're in private and an

150
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,830
elevator and nobody's watching at you so

151
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,409
by now we did the the old study again

152
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,990
and the whole answer it did not ever

153
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,540
come up again because everybody knows

154
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,940
that thing in there is looking if I'm

155
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,240
scratching my eyes now so yeah at that

156
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,760
point you know that you have you have to

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,370
change your your ways and a lot of

158
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,870
people when they are showing it in a way

159
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,270
like this they notice that they have

160
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,820
changed what they're doing and why

161
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
they're doing the things that they do so

162
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,630
I think the need for these kind of

163
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,959
projects is getting bigger and bigger so

164
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,600
I would like to invite everybody to come

165
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,100
to the summer festival sha it's a hacker

166
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,080
camp just like the Congress of CCC but

167
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,899
then in summer and as a camping it's

168
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,029
five days and there is a lot of people

169
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,260
doing projects there in villages and on

170
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,930
the main stage there is still a

171
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,170
possibility to to reach and to the call

172
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,100
of participation so and that way there

173
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,580
is still a lot of things that we could

174
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,430
do during this summer to get this

175
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,950
project but also a lot of other projects

176
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,360
like the cosy the you knows and these

177
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,640
kinds of projects getting them more

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,050
online and yeah I would like to invite

179
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,800
everybody to come over there and maybe

180
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,160
we can add some talks or maybe even a

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,110
village concentrated on that and yeah

182
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,529
that is mainly the idea about what the

183
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,740
freedombox could do and so I would like

184
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,230
to reserve a bit of extra time for

185
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,029
questions so maybe if there are a lot of

186
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,900
questions yes

187
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,270
it's quite easy to add people if we the

188
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,060
question was if you want to use software

189
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,350
that's not packaged yet for Debian how

190
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,670
do you do it well the plan is plant is

191
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,070
the tool that we use to have a web

192
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,510
interface and it's quite modular so if

193
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,720
you want you can easily add modules to

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,340
it too

195
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,540
[Music]

196
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,970
to use the project the products that you

197
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,240
need but they will not be included and

198
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,540
the next Sable release of the of the

199
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,030
software but if you want to use that

200
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,810
there is a you can make it as an add-on

201
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,530
and you can also make a derived

202
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,480
distribution that a lot of people

203
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,420
already are making so you start off with

204
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,660
freedom box which is pure Debian and

205
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,630
from there on you can add your own parts

206
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,390
and so we will be in stable soon but the

207
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,610
newest part of the development will be

208
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,920
going into testing so at some point

209
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,980
people will be us go into testing now

210
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,110
for the the newer features and they may

211
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,110
or may not be included into the next

212
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,940
Debian like we are Charlie which is a

213
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,760
small application to keep your bookmarks

214
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,700
and it's a really nice application but

215
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,220
in the end it got dropped from Debian

216
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,310
and we had to drop it from the desk from

217
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,290
freedom box as well

218
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:21,120
yeah okay that's short yeah yes that's

219
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:30,000
for me okay that's good

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,520
it's not going to be anywhere on any

221
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,340
accounts so if you if anybody likes I'll

222
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,470
delete the whole picture that was just

223
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,450
something that I saw somebody do and I

224
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,710
thought oh that's nice

225
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:49,230
so if sorry yeah okay I don't mind so

226
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,500
that is making up making the point in

227
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
the in the first place so if you have

228
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,170
privacy issues you should be able to say

229
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,960
something and if you are talking to

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,450
people instead of do a back company like

231
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,060
Google it's very difficult to do that

232
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,010
and with a person you can just come up

233
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,650
and say hey you personally I think

234
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,080
you're doing something wrong so I'm

235
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,600
really even proud that you guys are

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,220
saying this and yeah

237
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:27,980
[Applause]

238
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:45,090
okay yes sorry I don't understand back

239
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,080
port we're look do we use back parts and

240
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,430
Debian we are this is the first time

241
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,770
that we are being included and the

242
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,770
Debian stable so we are looking into

243
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,260
using that so if there are Debian devs

244
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,230
who are willing to help without getting

245
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,420
into that that would be very

246
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,790
advantageous to us but we don't have

247
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,000
that set up yet also because the the

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,520
back parts the mental now I think told

249
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,220
us please come to us when the times were

250
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,840
there but we are planning to do so to

251
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,740
keep people on stable able to move with

252
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,100
the the back parts to have some extra

253
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,810
features already but yeah that is an

254
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,830
issue with Debian and the aging of the

255
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,590
so far during the the years still the

256
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,370
next buster release that's going to be

257
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:59,310
the next tool I have no direct contact

258
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,720
with logs so I personally oh yeah how

259
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,210
many people have been using downloaded

260
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,310
and you are using the freedombox at the

261
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,000
moment I personally have no info about

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,660
how much exactly but I see a lot of

263
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,430
people a number of people in my

264
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,530
community that are testing it and I

265
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,900
there is some information on the on the

266
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,730
weekly which is on the freedombox

267
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,130
org so there is some usage information

268
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,660
but I think that more

269
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,699
and it's a few hundred people at most

270
00:16:44,209 --> 00:17:03,089
anyone yeah what about the email server

271
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,230
was a question the email server is still

272
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,949
not and we have run queue now to read

273
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,369
email but email servers are a very much

274
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:19,409
moving target so what is good to use

275
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:22,079
today is not good to use tomorrow so

276
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,909
it's really difficult to keep that up

277
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,650
straight and anyway is there a way to

278
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,150
secure email any way at all I think by

279
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,110
now we should say that email is just on

280
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,929
its last legs and we have to move on to

281
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,620
an axis and that is just not so well

282
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,539
suited for more and more reading of you

283
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,360
and stead of you reading the Internet so

284
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,240
there is always metadata leading leaking

285
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,429
and changing that will change would need

286
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,220
email to change its general nature so in

287
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,860
my opinion I hope there never will be

288
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,110
yeah some things just have to die at

289
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,309
some point

290
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:21,970
yeah but there are a lot of other

291
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,059
protocols and options that are that are

292
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:31,059
possible to take over its role and yeah

293
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,909
some things from long ago are still

294
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,139
current like I really like the de quoi

295
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:42,739
Soul car use and freedom box that's one

296
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,230
of my main use is to use IRC which is

297
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,720
also already from the 60s and that has

298
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,259
aged a bit better but a lot of the old

299
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,559
protocols are just not capable of

300
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:06,529
improving to current specs anyone okay

301
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:09,909
this is going to be a short talk

302
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:22,520
[Applause]
