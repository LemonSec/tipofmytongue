11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,030
how to write a novel using an

12
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,890
open-source software introduction to be

13
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,729
Bisco the story of the disco started in

14
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,380
1997 when we are published her third

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,990
album homogenic the trunk number four

16
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,840
was the beautiful Bachelorette at that

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,420
time I was 22 years old and I used to

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,520
watch the video of the song on the

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,909
newborn MTV Italy the video features

20
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,220
Bjork has a Bachelorette a young woman

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,429
who finds a book buried in her garden

22
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,459
that begins to write itself

23
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,229
she takes the book to a publishing house

24
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,110
and the book becomes so popular that

25
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,660
everyone in the city start reading it

26
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,970
ever since I was a child I've loved

27
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,800
reading but the video impressed me so

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,080
much that I noticed she to write came

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,619
over me in that period I spent so many

30
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,199
nights in front of my text editor this

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,720
one writing one word after another

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,970
following the idea of the story had in

33
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,000
my mind but every time I read what had

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,540
written

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,840
I felt a deep disappointment I didn't

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,129
understand why but it didn't work so

37
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,500
after several times I give up they did

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,349
kill myself to finish in my study of

39
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,200
computer engineering to reading to being

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,459
a 20 year old guy but many years later I

41
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,470
happened to watch the video game on

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,500
YouTube and that urgency to write came

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,510
back over me but I decided to stunning a

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,349
different approach so I started to study

45
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,420
dramaturgy and everything became clearer

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,700
and I learn

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,750
some important lessons lesson number one

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,390
the idea of the novel is to write guided

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,849
only by the sacred fire of inspiration

50
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,769
is quite nice lesson number two the most

51
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,680
important the concept of each character

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,720
is the driving force of every novel but

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,019
what is exactly a conflict a comedy is a

54
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,709
a desire to be realized is a reaction to

55
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,140
an external situation it is an inner

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,360
need conflict leads a Carter to action

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,310
and to change the condition of things

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,160
so a novel is the story of a change in

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,920
the condition of things and of the

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,989
evolution of characters during this

61
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,160
process there is no novel without

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,079
conflict that's it so it's all about

63
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,230
characters and novels only work if their

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,250
characters are believable characters

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,620
that are completely good or completely

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,489
evil are stereotypes and for these are

67
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,079
not believable characters are believable

68
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,329
when you can understand the complexity

69
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,029
of their human nature their qualities

70
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,019
their defects the contradictions so how

71
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,810
can create a believable characters the

72
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,150
only way is to know everything about

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,690
them behavior the physical aspects

74
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,630
sociology psychology all their life

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,169
before the novel begins with this

76
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,930
lessons learn I decided to get do--make

77
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,970
artist through a long series of

78
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,789
questions such as an interview so I

79
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,979
provide a Carter sheet on a simple text

80
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,270
document like this when I start to fill

81
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,130
in the form the cards graduate took

82
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,500
shape became real it was wonderful

83
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,180
because they were telling me their

84
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,880
stories and I just had to listen and

85
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,990
write down what they said when I

86
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,659
completed fill in the forms I was ready

87
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,910
to write the first thing of my novel

88
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,040
but soon I found myself lost in a

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,800
mountain out of the text document files

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,740
I tried to organize everything in

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,050
folders on my notebook but but wasn't

92
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,740
enough what I really needed was a normal

93
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,500
development environment a unique program

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,200
in which defined the architectural

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,390
elements of the novel to know my

96
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,000
characters to write my scenes with a

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,610
fully featured text editor I looked for

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,070
a soft like this but I couldn't find it

99
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,090
so I decided to make it myself because I

100
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,640
thought I'm a developer I have the

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,180
superpower of create things I soon

102
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,860
realized that project was complex and

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,200
ambitious but at the same time was

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,030
extremely exciting because it was my

105
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,250
project and I felt deep sense of

106
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,140
well-being a fulfillment in seeing my

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,900
literary soul and my computer soul which

108
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,420
said I have always considered as opposed

109
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,700
merging in the construction of something

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,790
new I used to work at the project in the

111
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,220
free time ahead after my family and my

112
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,860
professional activities and my mantra

113
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,410
becomes what have you done today for the

114
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,940
Bisco after Twitter was at least the B's

115
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,770
41.0 in the April 2014 Alice has to be

116
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,990
based on the GPL 2.0 the project was

117
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,690
well received and the help of the early

118
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,580
adopter were crucial they helped me to

119
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,650
find months they suggested me new

120
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,450
feature they translated the news from

121
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,700
their own languages they support the

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,710
project with posts and article the

123
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,200
supported me with beautiful messages I

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
had never received as a computer

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,310
consultant and this is the magic of the

126
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,530
open-source community where people from

127
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,790
all over the world

128
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,090
without knowing each other work together

129
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,580
to build something beautiful for the

130
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,390
benefit of all okay let's have a look a

131
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,460
brief look at the application the

132
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,370
viscosity is divided into section each

133
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,850
one accessible from the main menu bar in

134
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,930
the project section

135
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,509
there are some useful tips of dramaturgy

136
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,729
that can help riders especially the

137
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,750
beginners to find their workflow in the

138
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,289
architecture section you can define the

139
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,270
architectural elements of the oval there

140
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,630
is the premise the public contains the

141
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,960
entire narration of the third level in

142
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,509
one sentence conflict and resolution we

143
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,280
have the fabula the fabulous narration

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,380
of the ends in the enduro logical and

145
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,600
chronological sequence then we have the

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,650
settings the description of place time

147
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,900
and social context where the story is

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,850
developed then we have the narrative

149
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,100
strands each one connected to the

150
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,669
development on one specific conflict

151
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,530
fabric are as it's a status flag to

152
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,389
indicated the steps of the work by

153
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,380
default is red for to do and but you can

154
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,289
easily change it to yellow for not yet

155
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,490
complete or green for complete you can

156
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,370
define your architectural elements using

157
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,340
the discotheques Toledo is a fully

158
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,349
featured text editor with all the usual

159
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,620
command for bold italic underline and

160
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,930
for the other formatting needs there are

161
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,169
also a specific comments and shortcuts

162
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,059
for the dialogue symbols on the bottom

163
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,429
right you have a running the word in the

164
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,979
character count while in the bottom left

165
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,958
where you can change the status flag

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,550
this is the character section in the

167
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,560
culture section is divided into main

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,750
character in the secondary characters a

169
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,480
main card is a conflict a driving force

170
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,000
of the plot while a secondary car tests

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,190
don't have a conflict but it's use is

172
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,120
useful for the story development let's

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,130
go inside our main characters detail

174
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,650
here we can find all the cars that you

175
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,660
need to know everything about your

176
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,959
character and every car as its status

177
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,080
flag and we also have a card for the

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,480
attachment of the images over your

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,839
character in each car is a series of

180
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,910
questions that let you know your car

181
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,459
turn through an interview if you don't

182
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,810
like an interview mode that you

183
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,580
describe a particular aspect of your

184
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,320
cartel using a freelance mode in the

185
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,690
location section you can describe the

186
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,360
location of your novel and you can

187
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,520
attach images at every location and this

188
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,410
is the chapter section the chapter

189
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,720
section contains the chapter of course

190
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,330
of the novel and every chapter as its

191
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,930
card with its a status flag and its

192
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,910
count badge and you can use the

193
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,160
drag-and-drop to reorganize chapter

194
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,730
inside the novel let's go inside our

195
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,340
chapter detail view here we can find a

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,890
card to indicate the main purpose of the

197
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,620
chapter and account for the notes then

198
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,930
you can create the chapter by creating

199
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,120
the individual scenes every screen as

200
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,850
its card with the status flag and word

201
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,320
count badge you can use drag-and-drop to

202
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,030
reorganize the scene inside your chapter

203
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,950
visco saves all the revision of your

204
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,380
scene that you can always view or a

205
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,430
store a previous version when you write

206
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,050
your scene you can always view the

207
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,690
architectural elements of the normal car

208
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,880
test location and chapters we have

209
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,670
already written in a box next to the

210
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,650
text title it was extremely useful

211
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,680
because it's the one problem the novel

212
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,160
development environment you can also

213
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,070
target the scene with name of stock

214
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,500
characters point of view location time

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,770
and narrative strands if you tagged

216
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,390
probably the scene you can use in this

217
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,640
section it was a very interesting

218
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,890
because the analysis section show you

219
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,010
where and how often characters location

220
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,500
point of view narrative strengths show

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,100
up in your story and in exactly what

222
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,040
chapter all in a visual way for example

223
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,980
here you can see the chapter the Carter

224
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,620
distribution through in the chapters of

225
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,740
the audio Norman and he here you can see

226
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,970
the chapter length graph

227
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,410
finally in the export section it's

228
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,829
possible to export the novel in PDF RTF

229
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,329
or as archive some numbers at the moment

230
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,819
we despise more than 40,000 downloads

231
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,879
and is translated in 8 languages miss

232
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,160
quiz 1 is the one of the 7 cool little

233
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,999
open-source projects that stood out in

234
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,949
2016 in the ear book of open source code

235
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,079
come let's get one more technical the

236
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,309
actual version of this with the 1.5 1.6

237
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,309
is a Java desktop application that is

238
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,800
available on Linux Mac Windows is it's

239
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
written with eclipse absolutely

240
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,959
framework but but the user interface is

241
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,620
written in html5 and JavaScript for this

242
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,660
reason the next release of abisco

243
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,170
2.0 will be a full fully html5 and

244
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,779
JavaScript application and I will use

245
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,629
electron framework baguette up to write

246
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:38,559
the next release here there are some

247
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,389
reference to get in touch with the

248
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,850
project these we have we have a website

label I have not yet written my novel

261
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,809
but but if it's true that a person is

262
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,300
happy when is able to fully develop its

263
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,550
potential I can say with certainty that

264
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,449
we Bisco made me unhappy opers better

265
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,940
thank you very much Andre I think we

266
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,920
have some time for questions so Annie

267
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,770
take us I see a hand over there can you

268
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,000
wait one second and I'll bring the

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,580
microphone off to you okay so how can

270
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,280
you use all your cards like you

271
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,790
described them in your PDF or something

272
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,830
as a graph you know and use like I don't

273
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,470
know something like BDD programming you

274
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,580
know and order generate like words or

275
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,000
using some adjectives or some I don't

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,830
know some stuff about the characters in

277
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,460
order generate like chapters or

278
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,710
relationships because between the

279
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,740
characters and so on are you asking me

280
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,690
about the relation of their kind yeah if

281
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,020
I I know it's possible but have you ever

282
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,360
thought of it and with your contributors

283
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,780
slide but at the moment you can write it

284
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,360
in the sheet or in the curse of the

285
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,080
characters but I mean I'm thinking about

286
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,520
to insert a mind map to map the

287
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,200
calculations in the next release of the

288
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,180
disco I do know of any success stories

289
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,650
in these in your software with actual

290
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,870
books published okay we have just in the

291
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,930
start of the this year we have started a

292
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,260
blog to collect some success story and

293
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,870
we have we are waiting for the success

294
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,360
story of our users to publisher in the

295
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,660
spread

296
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:31,050
so any other questions spear and raise

297
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,469
of there

298
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,910
hi I tried to run be Bisco on Linux

299
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,160
distribution with open JDK and it didn't

300
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
work because it seems that to be

301
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,090
basically niché's version ships with the

302
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,690
Oracle Java client Java server

303
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,310
implementation he said like consider the

304
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,550
bug because you mention open source a

305
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,030
lot so ok I have to what I have to if

306
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,630
you open an issue on a guitar I can work

307
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,280
on it maybe but it's a in the next

308
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,910
version of visco we it's a full

309
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,760
JavaScript html5 and so there is no

310
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:25,110
general problems ok so I think we have

311
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,610
time for one last question if there are

312
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:43,890
any take us at the moment not at the

313
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,830
moment oh I we are thinking about it

314
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:55,050
but we so what format do you use for

315
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,860
saving the data in Bisco ok at the

316
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,910
moment you using a local database hh2

317
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,329
database is a local database in java but

318
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,650
in the next release the 2.0 I I think

319
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,310
about using a simple JSON file to store

320
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:25,020
everything in then I don't understand

321
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:34,530
the question I'm sorry ok ok

322
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,720
I think about it but I able to it's

323
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,640
difficult for me at the moment have an

324
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,880
Austin the

325
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,660
do that okay as I prefer the people

326
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:55,660
download on another machine yes yes it's

327
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,299
also this aspect

328
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,890
so I'm sorry that's all the time we have

329
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,770
Andrea thank you very much thank you

330
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:12,779
[Applause]
