html5 that in image because it's not

46
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,049
working okay it's very simple but they

47
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,000
call this why they must simple because

48
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,070
they only change the document right past

49
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,679
image is a type of script there is also

50

okay sweetie interesting direction but

69
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,070
it was a bit illogical in your

70
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,220
presentation because you say that

71
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,690
extension are part of Firefox everybody

72
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,420
it was made what made Firefox from lucky

73
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,940
cities but by the end of the year

74
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,010
2/3 of the important are done I use as

75
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:51,700
that I use every day we stop working to

76
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,660
change the P I destroy the new at the

77
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,060
station is the future because I should

78
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,250
not devastation is like a rapper

79
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,150
today s education for us then there will

80
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,880
be a change inside Firefox as we need

81
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,370
not cover like before without the CD k

82
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,590
that when they re Firefox the station is

83
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,180
broke and we just a show this problem

84
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,430
main problem because there is a lack of

85
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,040
refer to the inside

86
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,350
Firefox mechanics just work with no

87
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,620
problem using
