1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,610
science fiction story talk about

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,280
communications you always see it

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,690
supports everything that you're doing

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,889
all the cool things that are happening

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,690
in that science fiction story exist and

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,129
that's all oh that's cool and I'm gonna

7
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,410
build that I need that I need this it's

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,910
all underlying there is the

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,170
communication but nobody deals with that

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,580
it's kind of the hidden layer but it's

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,740
such an important layer but it kind of

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,630
is hidden for a reason and and right now

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,520
it's almost to populous almost too much

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,040
in a conversation one of my telecoms

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,510
professor used to say that you know the

16
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,149
telecom engineer Ovid anybody only

17
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,970
thinks about him when the system fails

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,110
so that we actually don't want to be

19
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,400
that person we should want to be the

20
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,310
underlying tech to support all this

21
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,260
stuff so a lot of that is going to be

22
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,050
taking it from the utility of the

23
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,120
processor geosoft radius or utilizing

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,780
your CPU heavily and mismanaging the

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,730
utilities of you know the resources that

26
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,710
CPU because you really want that thing

27
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,120
to just be you just want to launch

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,890
Guinea radio as part of your out the

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,720
rest of your application and can do all

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,160
the other stuff on top of there and

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,360
integrate it with the rest of your

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,640
operating system and just it being the

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,400
the tool that gets your data from one

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,250
point in space to another point in space

35
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,010
so getting that processor utilizing that

36
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,040
better and getting it out of the way is

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,049
gonna be a huge part to support the cool

38
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,520
things like what Bastion does like

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,590
seriously doing in his output

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,520
capabilities are the tools he's produced

41
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,159
you know he's he's up here making use of

42
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,530
this stuff right now we're almost sold

43
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,869
out here trying to just get that looks

44
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,460
like I'm mic is not working oh okay

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,310
alright so challenges I kind of touched

46
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,780
us on this in my talk a little bit you

47
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,250
know one of the one of the things that I

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,509
think is really cool about software

49
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,830
radios how many different fields it

50
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,860
requires to be successful you know it

51
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,869
requires people who know how to write

52
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,159
operating systems and over-scaled was

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
embedded stuff people who know wireless

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,939
communication systems and DSPs and FPGAs

55
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,079
that's also a significant challenge

56
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:11,439
right and what what we commonly see is

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,480
we have lots of different users who come

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
to the project with different

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,870
backgrounds and different expectations

60
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,020
and they end up

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,540
some perhaps not uncommon ly not being

62
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,860
successful you know one example would be

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,050
somebody who spent you know half a

64
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,990
decade in grad school studying studying

65
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,330
cellular networks and designing the next

66
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,740
cellular network that will be deployed

67
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,150
across the world and they're an expert

68
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,340
and you know this these sorts of

69
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,660
algorithms in theory and they know what

70
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm gonna go do I'm going to develop

71
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,570
this internet radio and they sit down

72
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,630
and they're told oh you know you need to

73
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,410
you need install this list of

74
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,030
dependencies and build something from

75
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,650
source and make sure your Python path

76
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,810
environment variable is set right and

77
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,470
he's like what's Linux you know it's a

78
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,580
little bit of his aggregation perhaps

79
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,170
but it's not far from the not far from

80
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,940
it right I see people who are these

81
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,140
wireless people we want to use green

82
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,580
your radio which is makes sense right

83
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,310
it's a wireless tool but they don't have

84
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,050
the software experience and from the

85
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,310
opposite side we have people who are

86
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,020
coming in to us from for example the

87
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,390
cybersecurity community who are software

88
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,640
experts and infer security experts who

89
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,800
maybe don't have the DSP background so

90
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,150
they open up the new radio and they see

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,950
examples of flow graphs and you know

92
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,390
it's like oh this little loop bandwidth

93
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,890
of this is 43 kilohertz and then we're

94
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,180
passing it through a polyphase channel

95
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,220
Iser and then we're equalizing it and to

96
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,010
them it's like whoa you know I where I

97
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,120
was just thinking this wasn't for speed

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,530
writing Python code and I realized I

99
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,320
needed to understand 100 years of DSP

100
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,760
theory and so the approachability and

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,650
usability of the project I think it's a

102
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,000
significant challenge because we have to

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,550
make it approachable and usable for so

104
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,330
many different types of people and we've

105
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,830
put a lot of effort into this and it's

106
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,570
come a long way so now you can come to

107
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,430
the project without any DSP background

108
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,600
at all and you can see lots of examples

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,190
of how people have built things and you

110
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,900
can learn how it works and then add on

111
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,370
to that and you know we have the out of

112
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,400
tree modules where you want to track you

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,930
know you want to track Air Force One as

114
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,130
it flies around the world with somebody

115
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,540
already built that for you and you can

116
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,640
install it and track air for someone as

117
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,030
it flies around and see how it works

118
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,380
it's just maybe cut that part out of the

119
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,469
video

120
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,300
and it's only in GQ rx for example which

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,490
was demonstrated several times that's an

122
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,380
example of a really great front-end for

123
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,330
if you're a ham radio enthusiast cheek

124
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,980
art GQ rx as you saw in Daniels

125
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,900
presentation was immediately useful GT

126
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,910
RX is built on top of goona radio that

127
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,130
is a good new radio application but you

128
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,360
didn't even know that looking at the

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,590
front end right so this problem of

130
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,130
usability and approachability and making

131
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,960
it so that lowering the barriers to

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,340
entry so regardless of where you're

133
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720
coming from you can come be successful

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,610
in the project regardless of the

135
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,900
technical challenge that you're trying

136
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,050
to solve that in itself is a really big

137
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,160
challenge for us yeah Michael e no no

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,660
comment on that I think it addresses the

139
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,550
problem from Bastion as well why do so

140
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,350
many so little people I think contribute

141
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,760
to the action and I think it's because

142
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,610
it's a really steep learning curve how

143
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,770
many of you were from PG students or

144
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,280
professors how many of you academia

145
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,010
okay so that's much less than I expected

146
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,670
I've seen it's dozens of times PG

147
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,350
student who comes to me because I know a

148
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,910
bit about software different radios and

149
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,700
he asks yeah my provider wants me to do

150
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,230
this project which is completely

151
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,540
realistic but his supervisor doesn't

152
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,010
know that and you know he's just

153
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,450
screaming on the student until he gets

154
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,560
it done and you know to build prototypes

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,940
especially like you said when you're

156
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,640
looking at LTE 5g is really advanced

157
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,070
standards you need to deal with

158
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,190
propagation RF FPGA and then you have

159
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,510
this electrical engineer who has been

160
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,980
working in Windows most of his life and

161
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,050
yeah I started out I never used Linux

162
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,520
before starting to work on this er

163
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
either so it was a really steep learning

164
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,410
curve and I think documenting that for

165
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,910
all kinds of different people would

166
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,520
really go a long way into bootstrapping

167
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,920
a lot more at least from the research

168
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,300
perspective really helping people

169
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,340
getting started because I see a lot of

170
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,230
people just get started and just give up

171
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,150
after a few months because you know they

172
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,890
don't get it they don't see it or don't

173
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,440
go the extra mile to learn something in

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
learn how to code in Linux or how to do

175
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,560
C++ or Python or whatever so I think we

176
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,690
I mean someone was suggesting a textbook

177
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,250
before I think that's actually really

178
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,440
good ID but you know target to a certain

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,820
audience of course

180
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,160
the textbook so yeah the textbook thing

181
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,360
because because actually try to write a

182
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,820
textbook when I was running the project

183
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,770
there's kind of two two issues with that

184
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,020
first because I was developing the

185
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,440
project trying to explain to people like

186
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,780
I we forget very easily what other

187
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,670
people don't know when we walk into the

188
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,470
room right like we can go very high

189
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,260
level very quickly you know I've tried

190
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,820
to talk to undergraduates and suddenly

191
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm in like you know PhD level

192
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,550
mathematics and they're just like you

193
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,280
know blank already sorry let me you know

194
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,740
what's back up here so trying to figure

195
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,870
that out is really difficult from so

196
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,430
from my perspective and that's what so

197
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,170
we actually made these these tutorials

198
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,300
Marcus over there was hugely helpful in

199
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
that and a lot of the actually Karlsruhe

200
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,780
students and others we actually we

201
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,820
specifically went in and tried to get

202
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,280
people who were not gonna radio experts

203
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,810
but had like but you know knew something

204
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,830
about the area we're a little bit

205
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,510
familiar with it but so that they could

206
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,280
think from that perspective of you know

207
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,020
I didn't know this when I came into it

208
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,520
so this is helpful to put that stuff

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
down the second thing that I had a

210
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,300
problem with writing a textbook was by

211
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,530
the time I wrote a chapter it was

212
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,510
already obsolete and that was just

213
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,500
really annoying because we were moving

214
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,200
so so fast writing that writing in a

215
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,700
radio and doing all the cool stuff that

216
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,970
we now do I'll leave it to Ben to kind

217
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,860
of maybe think about where we are from

218
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,210
that perspective because maybe it is at

219
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,400
a more stable position now as far as

220
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,630
just the rapid movement that we were

221
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,950
doing to get to where we are

222
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,960
maybe the stability exists so that we

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,640
could write that because I think it

224
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,170
would be helpful to have a tax day a

225
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:09,500
something out there in a sec I just want

226
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,880
to sort of make sure that we sort of

227
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,430
stay on track and focus and you know

228
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,050
move this in a good direction it's I'm

229
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,510
gonna gonna go into whatever one of you

230
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,060
said right now but it seems like this

231
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,620
accessibility is sort of like the most

232
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,090
the most urgent problem you need to

233
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,010
solve just like just talking to your you

234
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,770
four guys how many people here have

235
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,750
tried using you know radio just raise

236
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,539
your hand and keep your hand up if you

237
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,340
if you feel the same way that was that

238
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,890
it was hard to get into so it's like

239
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,909
people are actually yeah so I feel like

240
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,800
this is like this is a good

241
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
thing to talk about well looks like this

242
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,560
is something you're also interested in

243
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,529
so before we forget about you would let

244
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,180
me pass you the microphone well I have a

245
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,980
booth question in him so to dad and it's

246
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,830
probably more to my academia academic

247
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,060
colleague well I am responsible for like

248
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,490
40 hours of RF design experience stuff

249
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,750
and I have like 10 student in master one

250
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,110
and I think they would be interested in

251
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,670
contributing to that kind of project

252
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,709
because I'm completely against a

253
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,220
vertical class meant of student project

254
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,750
I find that completely stupid people

255
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,089
work on stuff that makes sense to try to

256
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,279
make them work for the greater good or

257
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,970
the community

258
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,660
but how where do I start

259
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,950
yeah this is maybe very obvious to the

260
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,500
people in this room but when I talk

261
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,470
about new radio to friends were

262
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,250
interested in RF they don't understand

263
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,490
exactly exactly what new radio is and to

264
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,790
me what I try to tell them it's it's a

265
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,970
tool to build tools and I feel that

266
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,220
that's something I had to figure out by

267
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,850
myself in a way like it's the radio is

268
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,260
not an end to itself it's you can build

269
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,450
something that will work standalone and

270
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,370
if you have one particular use case like

271
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,040
for example I design hardware which

272
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,260
communicates over RF and no radio is

273
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,850
really nice to build a test bench or

274
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,010
something to measure the performance or

275
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,370
whether I'm polluting the airwaves and

276
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,779
when I've built that I might not touched

277
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,820
new radio for another six months but I

278
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,459
want that tool to run daily and to run

279
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,980
standalone and ideally and that might be

280
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,050
science fiction but I would even like to

281
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,610
take that tool and put it on my phone

282
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,440
like Android because we all know that

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,060
it's going to be a lot harder on other

284
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,160
platforms but at least like to build

285
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,360
that into something that can work

286
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,720
standalone and maybe I won't ignore it

287
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,490
well it would it will be there as a

288
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,819
library but my tool would be like GQ rx

289
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,250
and that's what actually one of the only

290
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,500
examples I know of a tool and there are

291
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,870
probably others but of a tool that like

292
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,910
an aspen out of new radio and there's

293
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,839
now a tool in and of itself and I don't

294
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,029
know maybe there is something to that

295
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,740
and telling people okay you love that

296
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,829
tool now go learn what has been used to

297
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,509
build it that's a great point we address

298
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,370
it in G's in G talk a little I think Ben

299
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,420
would be a rocket could get comment as a

300
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,310
question I just wanted to comment on the

301
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,259
teaching part I'm teaching about 30

302
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,050
hours of digital communication and radio

303
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,589
frequency and when you ask did you find

304
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,660
new radio difficult I did raise my hand

305
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,240
but actually it I was mistaken it's not

306
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,519
the new radio part that I found

307
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,949
difficult it's actually the well the

308
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,240
particular thing I found difficult was

309
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,980
propagating the right sampling rate so

310
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,449
being consistent on the same thing right

311
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:03,250
between all blocks and what I mean here

312
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,839
is I didn't find new radio difficult I

313
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,850
found DSP difficult in the beginning

314
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,949
and once I think this is really the main

315
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:11,019
challenges is we story about being

316
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,819
consistent about the sampling rate and

317
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,339
after 30 hours we can get a few students

318
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,980
get involved at least from the user

319
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,689
perspective using the radio for the

320
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,279
module dilating of various signals with

321
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,779
the workflow of course box up we go all

322
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,120
the way to TPS with the students in 30

323
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,649
hours to be difficult but we get to

324
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,670
where but I think you radio allows

325
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,779
students within three hours of teaching

326
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,759
so that's a comment from me practical

327
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,009
well okay I'll add one more question and

328
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,730
it was a try and actually also a

329
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,500
question well as a user I also use all

330
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,420
the things like a red tile where you can

331
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,769
really have an app store or something

332
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,410
you can dummy feiyu you just go there

333
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,629
you run this application and if it works

334
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,430
and then you can start digging deeper

335
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,879
and modifying things and crisp new radio

336
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,559
I had this feeling that I to work to

337
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,449
make my first application and then what

338
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,420
I wanted to discover go deeper writing

339
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,250
modules every time it's really quite a

340
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,400
big big big step so it might

341
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,140
Jason would be to have some even simple

342
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,460
way of getting this first great thing

343
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,240
going because that motivates people okay

344
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,860
so so I think this is good let me just

345
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,110
check my notes I'm trying to keep track

346
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,330
of all the questions are we we don't

347
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,860
have all that much time I think we've

348
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,360
already come up with way more things

349
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,970
that we could talk about in even the

350
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,830
entire hour but there seems to be a

351
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,950
common theme here is sort of the

352
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,150
accessibility and then how to get people

353
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,620
in and basically your questions on how

354
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,820
to get people started I think would

355
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,480
actually be a very good yeah

356
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,640
segue into sort of the next section so I

357
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,220
I know I cut off the book discussion but

358
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,170
I I feel like this is more relevant you

359
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,000
want people people in the crowd so I'm

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,130
just gonna pass that on like how do we

361
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,950
get started so we have a specific

362
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,480
example was we have a classroom of

363
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,370
master students what would be a good

364
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,350
good thing to do a good first thank you

365
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,850
oh okay so just bit on documentation I

366
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,240
think I just did a great job on uhd

367
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,370
manual in the recent years I mean I

368
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,870
remember when I started on it it was

369
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,750
just haphazard collection of notes and

370
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,330
it was very hard to find anything you

371
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,400
had go on mailing list all time and you

372
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,120
know spam you and stuff like that and I

373
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,970
think this has been really worked on

374
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,330
recently I think that's something that

375
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:47,010
could be done agree radio as well well

376
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,570
okay I don't know because they but they

377
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,460
could use that to get started I think

378
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,560
you know if you have a couple of webpage

379
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,120
and it's easier to maintain and to

380
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,520
update as you move along then the

381
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,690
textbook which is probably you're

382
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,590
probably right about that but that

383
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,960
manual really wants a long ways and I

384
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,280
can just send my students say okay you

385
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,260
read those pages of the manual and you

386
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,910
know come back in one week and then we

387
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,740
can actually get certain more

388
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,180
interesting stuff so I'm

389
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,540
I kind of hear two separate questions

390
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,070
I'm going to answer your questions and

391
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,900
actually I'm gonna answer all the

392
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,830
questions again from the side of the

393
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,940
room at once so regarding just DSP stuff

394
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,930
generally right you're talking about

395
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,240
sampling rate but there's lots of stuff

396
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,900
like that and yeah a fir filter right I

397
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,690
mean what does fi r stand for right how

398
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,279
many good radio users know what fi r

399
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
stand for and I mean it just isn't a

400
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,410
thank you Phillip

401
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,330
and I remember an email that we got on

402
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,380
the mailing list several years ago

403
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,570
someone who was sampling some Nyquist

404
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,700
and was furious that you know radio was

405
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,640
aliasing his sinusoids and you know you

406
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,560
just you think about stuff like that and

407
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,510
I may have just broken the mic and so

408
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,220
going back to the comments I tried to

409
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,230
make when I was opening I think one of

410
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,510
our major challenges is making good a

411
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,140
radio tool such that it is approachable

412
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,390
by by people who perhaps don't have that

413
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,700
background you know and make you so that

414
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,870
if you look at it and you don't know

415
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,580
what all those words mean it doesn't

416
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,010
scare you right you know I don't think I

417
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,180
don't think that we've been successful

418
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,060
doing that yet coming back over here

419
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,279
talking about education getting people

420
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,709
started I kind of see this is all one

421
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:32,890
big problem so education actually is a

422
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,720
really big deal for us there's lots of

423
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,400
universities that are using you know

424
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,110
radio and actively developing and not

425
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,850
just labs but also curriculum

426
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,450
development actually the one of the one

427
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,170
of the groups I mentioned my

428
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,820
presentation the NRO National Radio

429
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,100
Astronomy Observatory has recently

430
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,720
secured federal funding in the United

431
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,709
States from the NSF to not just teach

432
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,279
students about RF with goon radio but to

433
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,500
teach teachers with goony radio how to

434
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,620
teach students and that is extremely

435
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,290
exciting to me but it's also a little

436
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,990
bit terrifying because you imagine

437
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,250
they're high school teachers by the way

438
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,230
so you imagine high school teachers

439
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,599
trying to resolve a falling down a

440
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
dependency hell and trying to figure out

441
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
you know how do i how do I install the

442
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,859
right version of Python on this legacy

443
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,720
cent ah system that my high school says

444
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,709
I have to use because they haven't

445
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,179
updated their network in ten years right

446
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,290
laughs some people have experienced this

447
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,010
right

448
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,169
so container izing things I'm using the

449
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,549
word container here separate I realize

450
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,660
everyone thinks of docker soon as you

451
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,080
say container or flat packs or you know

452
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,280
whatever the the current rage is but

453
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,120
container izing these sorts of things

454
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,460
such that you radio itself cannot only

455
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,880
be and then easily

456
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,500
pull from after the question that you

457
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,690
had asked is something that we're

458
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,750
actually working very hard on right now

459
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,700
that everyone recognizes that as a huge

460
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,080
challenge and that if we successfully

461
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,540
solve that problem it would make

462
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,210
everything easier just everything easier

463
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,940
and as no pie bombs is actually the

464
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,590
first step in our process towards that

465
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,720
and you you were joking about an app

466
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,610
store but in also we are actually very

467
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,550
serious about an app store so the way

468
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,420
pie bombs works is it there's a pipe

469
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,280
bombs recipes and the C grande website

470
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,530
is actually auto pulling the pipe bombs

471
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,000
list of recipes and populating the

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
webpage and so it's a easy step to go

473
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,430
from where we are now to a GUI that you

474
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,770
can browse and click and install but the

475
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,420
key enabling technology that we haven't

476
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,480
solved yet is okay how do we again

477
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
contain your eyes all of that such that

478
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,440
it is a click to install right now it's

479
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,990
a oh I can search it I can click it and

480
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,940
now I get cloned install or pipe bombs

481
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,230
clone install and it does all the

482
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,420
dependencies right and it's that kind of

483
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,660
difficulty that scares people away that

484
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,250
don't have the Linux experience the

485
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:05,590
software experience so that actually

486
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,909
covers a lot of what I want to tell you

487
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:25,928
yeah he does really do basic stuff yes

488
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,950
Tom can answer this so just just to give

489
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,720
background for Tom's response I'm

490
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
assuming just to give some background

491
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,899
before Tom responds to that question

492
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:43,940
for anyone who doesn't know I'm sorry

493
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,649
what's your name okay

494
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:46,909
he doesn't know what case is talking

495
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,159
about Michael Ozma has a series of

496
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,100
tutorials video tutorials that don't

497
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,389
just teach that don't just go over how

498
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,090
to use get a radio but they go through

499
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,379
basic theory that you would need to

500
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,210
design a wireless comm system from the

501
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,769
ground up including what is a complex

502
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,340
number right it starts at that level so

503
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,499
with that that's great yeah that's right

504
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,029
and Mike Osman is a part of our

505
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,499
community you know he comes to our the

506
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,509
conference is you know he promotes uses

507
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,489
generated promotes it and when people do

508
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:14,779
ask me this question where do I started

509
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,190
that that's often one of the first

510
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,889
places to point them to I think Marcus

511
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,570
over there probably has a macro now on

512
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,429
his computer to reply with tutorials da

513
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,460
cunha radio org yeah like we had so much

514
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,679
that we they made a subdomain tutorials

515
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,059
not generated that org you know we did

516
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,289
spend a lot of time on that because we

517
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,759
were focused on this problem but of

518
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,499
course that only covers a certain number

519
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,480
of subjects and we I had always wanted

520
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,039
to take that even further and have more

521
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,659
of those types of tutorials and and

522
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,179
improved there but but you know Mike

523
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,200
will help give you some of the

524
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,299
background ESP the tutorials will help

525
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,889
give you some of that but also like how

526
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:49,909
do you write a block how do you write a

527
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,489
block in Python and C++ so so there is

528
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,350
tools out there and and you know this

529
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,340
has been a conversation we've been

530
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,230
having with the community at large for

531
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,940
for basically 10 years since I've been

532
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,139
or Morse that have been involved in this

533
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,749
project so we definitely heard you and

534
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:05,600
and it's it is a big part of what we're

535
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,359
trying what we've been trying to do

536
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,889
obviously we're not there yet and again

537
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,779
you know I I have a PhD in electro

538
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,980
engineering wireless communications

539
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,769
right so it's like how do I take the the

540
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,539
years that I spent learning this stuff

541
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,129
and condense it down into a week's worth

542
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:20,840
of material that you can walk away with

543
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,989
with with some confidence now it should

544
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,489
be done I think we can do it but it's

545
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,200
it's a it's a tough challenge just to

546
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,169
kind of lay that lay that out there one

547
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,830
of the two things I don't do

548
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,590
Bastien responds one of them is maybe to

549
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,059
take some of his thunder but really to

550
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,919
he pointed this out in his opening

551
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,270
remarks and I want to just reiterate

552
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,460
them because it was a it was a very

553
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,559
astute comment that we haven't really I

554
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,299
don't think thought about if Sea Grant

555
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:50,270
and pie bombs were built to support this

556
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,880
ecosystem of all these tools and apps

557
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
that people are creating on top of the

558
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,630
toolbox of being radio and that's great

559
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,940
but they tend to just be a single user

560
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,010
who is behind that and who maintains it

561
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,950
and so if they go away if they you know

562
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,360
get sick of it or they just get a job

563
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,919
that doesn't support them you know or

564
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,200
time to do this stuff what happens to

565
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
that code it starts to bit rot it

566
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,470
there's no support for it you know

567
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,299
nobody replies to the mailing list on it

568
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,100
that's a huge problem and that so I

569
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,690
think you know we've been building the

570
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,090
community around this idea of Sea Grant

571
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,700
but not really really focusing on on

572
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,210
getting more than just a single author

573
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,520
invested and working on some of the big

574
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,380
tools that people do want to use so that

575
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,520
I think something that would be really

576
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,220
interesting to to work on so the other

577
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,000
thing that I want to mention and I'm

578
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
gonna throw him under the bus

579
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,150
unfortunately I love the guy but ballin

580
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,130
isn't here to defend himself but guys

581
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,260
like myself and ballin tan and others

582
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,760
who go around doing a lot of

583
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,140
presentations on how to use can your

584
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,059
radio sometimes I look back at us

585
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:50,990
thinking like I don't know if we've

586
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,700
really done ourselves the right service

587
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,520
with how we presented the material it's

588
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,870
like here's all this cool stuff you can

589
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,370
do and get a radio and people walk away

590
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,960
going oh my god that's so cool I can do

591
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,160
all this cool stuff and then they sit

592
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,030
down they're like I've no idea how so we

593
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,650
kind of go at it with like of course you

594
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,910
just blah blah blah you just create a

595
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,799
5,000 block flow graph and it's gonna do

596
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,200
this thing and you're just like but it

597
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,690
we almost oversimplify it when we show

598
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,900
it in that light as opposed to you know

599
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,790
kind of going it at a different level of

600
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,600
like let's build this concept up so and

601
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,490
that's like we've shown how you can use

602
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,049
any radio but it points to John

603
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,600
Michele's comment there about we don't

604
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,820
necessarily we don't dive enough into

605
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,250
the DSP to give you the backgrounds so

606
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,840
in order to do the stuff that we we can

607
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,510
do quote so easily so I think that's

608
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,530
actually that that's something

609
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,770
interesting I I try to amend this a

610
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,840
little bit and one of my last gr con

611
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,010
talks I

612
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,470
there's kind of a there was a block or a

613
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,540
tutorial that Eric blossom wrote when he

614
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,860
created Guinea radio like the probably

615
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,030
him in mad adness probably did this

616
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,570
together

617
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,970
called how to write a block and it was

618
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,110
to kind of walk through how you just

619
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,070
kind of start from scratch and write

620
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,710
your own block and get a radio so I made

621
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,940
a lecture that says how not to write a

622
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,669
block and it was supposed to in 30

623
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:06,020
minutes kind of walk through some of the

624
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,610
common mistakes that we make when we

625
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,470
write this stuff and so kind of trying

626
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,700
to go go at it from a different

627
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,620
perspective of when things go wrong what

628
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,809
do you do then what we've often done is

629
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,070
just when everything goes right it's

630
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,690
awesome but what happens when things go

631
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,360
wrong so so that's that those are maybe

632
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,280
some ideas too that we can keep working

633
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,370
on to address some of these topics and I

634
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,100
wanted to add that and the problem with

635
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,890
yet that students find it very hard to

636
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,740
get into a new radio I think it would of

637
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,210
course really good if we have good

638
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,980
documentation so that you can tell the

639
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,600
student go there read that stuff and

640
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,730
then you know what you have to do but I

641
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,220
think it the ideal case would be if they

642
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,679
that would be also kind of getting help

643
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,299
like there would be courses there some

644
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:52,490
signal processing with new radio for

645
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,290
example and I think it's currently very

646
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,419
hard for the I think many senior

647
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,660
academics realize that you know radio is

648
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,669
the thing it's cool we maybe want to use

649
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,679
it but as you said like if you then

650
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,240
really are trying to implement something

651
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,549
even if you know the theory and even if

652
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,010
you teach that for years I think it it

653
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,280
doesn't take zero time so it also so for

654
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,799
a professor for example to create this

655
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,990
new course I think he might have a hard

656
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,179
time so these course materials that you

657
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,070
mentioned that then they create I think

658
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,160
they could help really a lot if you have

659
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,490
like as some lectures and the virtual

660
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,750
machine that you can just give the

661
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,370
students so that they are up and running

662
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,679
in basically zero time so that could be

663
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,960
very beneficial then if they start with

664
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,360
that class then they can maybe read the

665
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,460
more advanced material later and do some

666
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,530
bachelor's thesis or master thesis in

667
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,020
the topic so I think that would be

668
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,970
really cool for us to get more students

669
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,690
I

670
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,309
let me summarize the current state of

671
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,720
the discussion first so it seems like

672
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,789
that we have a consensus that an ad that

673
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:02,770
includes all of you in the room III

674
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,260
would please tell me if you disagree is

675
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,690
that um no documentation would always be

676
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,190
bette better like more is always better

677
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,770
that's always been the case as I joined

678
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,669
the project 10 years ago or so so like

679
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:17,320
that'll that'll continue being the

680
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,700
problem of course we don't have

681
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,900
professional writers someone needs to

682
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,750
write that documentation so we have two

683
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,090
loose ends I feel like I'd like to wrap

684
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,230
up Sodor I just want to bring them up

685
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,610
again so we don't forget about them the

686
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,230
first one was the actual practical

687
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,210
question what do your students do and I

688
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,309
feel like maybe this is coming together

689
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:36,429
maybe we're sort of converging on a on a

690
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,630
single problem because the other one was

691
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,340
like where are all those cool standalone

692
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,289
apps and that's also something and it

693
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:42,640
was the very first thing Tom brought up

694
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,380
although he phrased it differently it's

695
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,919
like we can we can decode ATSC but we

696
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,049
don't have a cool ATSC viewing app that

697
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,570
it just looks nice it looks like VLC or

698
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,250
something and does gonna radio in the

699
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,679
background by the way that is a G sock

700
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,299
project that we've suggested because we

701
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,950
are aware of that problem it seems like

702
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,100
the people in the community prefer you

703
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,080
know working on the low on the low level

704
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,669
guts not on the shiny was it exactly

705
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:09,610
what Tom said the beginning and so

706
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,080
there's like a third threat I don't

707
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,340
think we'll be able to address it it's

708
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,230
like how could we get more people sort

709
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,210
of take responsibility and collaborate

710
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,679
on projects I feel like that's also a

711
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,549
very generic free software radio if

712
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,530
sorry free software open source problems

713
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,830
so let's focus on that right

714
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,380
now but I feel like all the other things

715
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,240
that we just talked about the converging

716
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,049
on a on a common theme of like when we

717
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,730
get people new people involved what can

718
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,679
they work on by the way we're lacking

719
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,080
all these one cool standalone apps would

720
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,820
be a documentation maybe that's exactly

721
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,700
the kind of direction we can go into so

722
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,460
I hope I have no simplified the the sort

723
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,740
of the outstanding questions and

724
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,789
statements here but I feel like that

725
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:53,530
sort of where this conversation is going

726
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,390
so we had a comment from Xiaomi share I

727
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,830
think we had another question and you

728
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,360
wanted to say something so what was your

729
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,570
comment

730
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,110
okay forgive give you the mic but what

731
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,020
John Michell said was that if we want to

732
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,640
play around this peak radio is a great

733
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,040
tool especially for the prototyping okay

734
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,510
I'll give you back the mic and like and

735
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,310
just start with you and you can pass it

736
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,370
around and I'd like you I know you had

737
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,560
another comment but what do you feel

738
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,240
about this concept that if we want to

739
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,740
get the new students involved we want

740
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,090
maybe we could just have the building

741
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,690
the apps

742
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,210
is this a feasible direction the the

743
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,700
project can take and maybe as a site

744
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,470
issue can be sort of work on the

745
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,420
documentation in the end in the same

746
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,320
pass so I'm not really a software guy

747
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,450
more Hardware guys so I don't know much

748
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,220
about writing apps and making shiny

749
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,100
things on the computer I think it would

750
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,040
definitely be a good selling point there

751
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,270
is a lot of surf that's already out

752
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,210
there in radio and that likes this shiny

753
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,100
display to kind of make it nice and you

754
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,540
know especially if it's open-source if

755
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,920
people want to start changing it

756
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,990
afterwards well that would be a great

757
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,540
way to one get them evolve and get them

758
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,340
interested and started using it and then

759
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,020
once they want to go beyond what they

760
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,460
see well they can still go digging in

761
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,930
the codes and and try to figure it out

762
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,230
by themselves

763
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,650
so I think I talked about this every

764
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,710
single time I get them like cross-domain

765
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,750
doesn't matter where you come from

766
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,679
something skim skill you have as

767
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,160
applicable I I think that as a student

768
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,250
coming to get a radio whether you know

769
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,390
you're coming to get radio because you

770
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,450
want to because you're a DSP person and

771
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,740
you want to build DSP app or you're not

772
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,530
a DSP person and you want a good radio

773
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,559
app that does something that you know is

774
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,289
interesting in your particular field I

775
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,789
would be blown away if any new user who

776
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,260
came to get a radio students included

777
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,919
did not have a skill that would be that

778
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,990
they could contribute to the project I

779
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,940
don't care what it I don't if you even

780
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,210
if you only know JavaScript I mean we we

781
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,010
have a need for JavaScript developers we

782
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,470
have a need for just about anything you

783
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,250
could think of QT developers I mean

784
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,630
really it if in if you only know you

785
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,130
don't know any programming language I

786
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,840
mean there's obviously a need for

787
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,059
technical documentation which is in

788
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,620
writing good technical documentation is

789
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,400
a really hard problem that is often

790
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,140
underestimated so I mean I I think one

791
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,929
of the major problems in terms of you

792
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:16,370
know people coming to get a radio and

793
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,640
they starting to use it is right now

794
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,090
there's not a good way to know where the

795
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,570
gaps are and what we using the Royal we

796
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,520
hear is in the project leadership care

797
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,909
about having solved right I mean you

798
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,010
could go to our bug tracker which has

799
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,690
lots of bugs in it but unless you

800
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,250
already you're familiar with the way

801
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,570
goony radio works most of the bugs

802
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,740
probably aren't going to make any sense

803
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,440
to you and there also isn't a bug that

804
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,440
says for example like the good radio

805
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,820
project I'd like to have a web front-end

806
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,440
that does X or the greater project I'd

807
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,090
like to have a new QT widget that does Y

808
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,190
right there's a bug that says QT widget

809
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,059
X is broken

810
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,260
please somebody fix it because I need it

811
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,830
for my master's thesis

812
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:03,080
so I I one of the things that I've been

813
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,700
trying to figure out internally as a way

814
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,409
to communicate to the community at large

815
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,700
the things that we care about and the

816
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,010
gaps that are in the project not just

817
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,510
the problems that we that are currently

818
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,919
in the project but the areas that we

819
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,740
want to grow into because and I feel

820
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,419
like as a student we're talking about

821
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:21,679
here students coming to the project but

822
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,659
I feel question really is more general

823
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,970
as as a new user coming to the project

824
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,700
everybody has had skills you know and

825
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,309
I'm 100% confident that everybody has a

826
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:32,659
skill that could make the project better

827
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,220
and I think finding a way to communicate

828
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,399
that and communicating you know all the

829
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,240
different areas that you could

830
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,830
contribute so that when you become

831
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,630
involved you know even if you're not a

832
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,260
DSP expert or a software expert you're

833
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,870
able to identify a way that that you can

834
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,370
get involved and start having fun and

835
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,630
that's just not something that we do

836
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,899
well right now here's a question should

837
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:15,890
I I'd say I'm a competent programmer but

838
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,799
not a really good programmer I'm not an

839
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,520
expert but even when you have the will

840
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,700
to contribute sometimes you're like I

841
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,539
don't know how to ask these big brains

842
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,580
where to get started and so there's

843
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,990
documentation there is knowing where to

844
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,000
put your energy so you've talked about

845
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,059
that but then how do you take the first

846
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,899
step like to me it would be interesting

847
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,940
to know that there is someone I could

848
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,549
ask just for help on doing and not

849
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:55,159
asking you please fix fix the widget I'm

850
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,370
willing to fix the widget but if I if I

851
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,360
don't know where to start

852
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,730
it's also really really nice to know

853
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,950
that okay just being that guy and he'll

854
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,570
he'll get you started he doesn't have

855
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,429
time to fix it for you but he'll he'll

856
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,589
put the time and effort to tell you at

857
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,790
least where to look

858
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,379
I know how to talk about ten minutes I

859
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:13,699
really want to respond to that door

860
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,810
acida Tom okay all right so I had this

861
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,639
discussion really regularly especially

862
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,739
people who are not who have heard about

863
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,359
what it's like to contribute to free

864
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,879
software and come away terrified from it

865
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,429
right I mean I I I have family members

866
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,109
who have never written a line of code of

867
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,030
software in their life and have read

868
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,340
emails that Linus Torvalds has written

869
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,949
right and are like why would anyone ever

870
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,139
do this why have you dedicated your life

871
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,710
to writing free software right the good

872
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,149
radio project it's always been this way

873
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:48,168
and I feel very strongly about this I'm

874
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,168
not interested in that and the greater

875
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,719
project I don't think it ever should

876
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,239
become that simple because of the nature

877
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,130
of the project we have to be inclusive

878
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,150
and I understand I I not attacking Linus

879
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,950
I actually there are a lot of projects

880
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,450
and I could name some more I completely

881
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,869
understand the need to protect your time

882
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,710
right for someone who comes and says hey

883
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,800
you know you're you're not this is not a

884
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,350
good radio example but like a hey your

885
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,900
gsm base station isn't working I don't

886
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,670
know what GSM stands for but can you

887
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,500
please can you fix the bug for me you

888
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,960
know that and I understand the immediate

889
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,430
reaction to say you're not even willing

890
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,619
to put time into this you need you to go

891
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,690
away it's often not said quite so

892
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,970
politely we're we will never do that

893
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,940
and I feel very strongly that as a

894
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,140
project we must always be inclusive and

895
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,030
approachable and welcoming of developers

896
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,170
regardless of skill level so and we have

897
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,100
a lot of people in the community who

898
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
actively do that I think Marcus Muller

899
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,740
here ooh-yah who probably should be more

900
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,740
acknowledged for this has if you're on

901
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,880
the mailing list he's effectively

902
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,750
written masters theses in responses to

903
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,369
emails that include like la tech

904
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,650
equations explaining basic sampling

905
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,710
theory and complex numbers so as a

906
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,150
community were already willing to do

907
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,619
that and we're already willing to accept

908
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:16,970
these people who who don't have the

909
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,680
background to even be successful on day

910
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,460
one or week one or month one but yeah

911
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,790
the the

912
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,390
that we have is exactly what you said is

913
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,070
knowing how to contribute who do I

914
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,290
contact who would I email what website

915
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,380
do I go to that tells me like how to

916
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,580
just even get my foot in the door and

917
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,550
start talking to somebody right and I

918
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,200
would really like to solve that problem

919
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,120
I have some ideas about how to solve it

920
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,160
and if anyone has feedback on that

921
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,000
please come talk to me

922
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,910
yeah that's great yeah absolutely guy

923
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,050
cuz that kind of goes into what I was

924
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,990
gonna say and I I fear that I'm gonna

925
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,120
get into mode of whining so let me try

926
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,890
to change the whining into setting up

927
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,170
more of a challenge the documentation

928
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,380
issue

929
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,940
everybody's been yelling at me you know

930
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,080
when I was running the program at

931
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,790
projects your documentation is terrible

932
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,770
evaluations terrible then I'd have it in

933
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,690
a CI yeah we know like we want to work

934
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,220
on it we're dedicate to working on it

935
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,510
we've tried to work on I think it's much

936
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,950
better than than it was you know ten

937
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,470
years ago but they don't and then a few

938
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,910
people one percent will come up to say

939
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm gonna help you with that

940
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,090
documentation that's great we start like

941
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,460
getting you know you know emails back

942
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,330
and forth and if they're gonna

943
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,800
contribute to the code you know even the

944
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,690
documentation get them signed up so they

945
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,650
can contribute to the free software

946
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,940
foundation there's a copyright holder

947
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,710
all that stuff and then they just

948
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,620
disappear like I've probably lost like

949
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,720
two dozen at least people who are like

950
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,220
I'm gonna help you the documentation and

951
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,570
then a month later I never hear from

952
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,490
them again and I think maybe it's

953
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,810
because they don't realize how difficult

954
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,390
writing this documentation can be to do

955
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,560
it in a way that actually can convey

956
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,850
information so and I'll you know put

957
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,830
myself here I wrote all that I read all

958
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,420
the polyphase filter Bank stuff in

959
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,310
Guinea radio and I wrote documentation

960
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,380
for that so the header files and these

961
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,120
are some header files are like pages of

962
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,330
explanation of the basic theory of the

963
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,800
how the parameters work and all this

964
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,170
stuff and I still get people say like

965
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,880
well you can't use those polyphase

966
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,310
analyzers you just can't use them

967
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,330
where's the documentation I've shown the

968
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,680
documentation they read through and

969
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,670
they're like I still have no idea what

970
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,350
to do so again that just proves that

971
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,300
like and I have an English minor right I

972
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
think I'm a pretty good writer but I

973
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,020
still don't know how to convey my deep

974
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,090
deep knowledge of the math and the

975
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,290
theory behind those probably phase

976
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,490
channelize errs into something that

977
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,720
somebody else can actually pick up that

978
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,360
block and make use of so it's a hard

979
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,100
challenge and I really want to bring

980
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,340
somebody into it so here's the challenge

981
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,319
as has been pointed out mark

982
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,029
has written like literally probably I

983
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:40,440
don't know there's there's a PhD

984
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,089
dissertation somewhere in all of

985
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:46,549
Marcus's mailing list posts be cool so

986
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,859
yeah but I mean because if you don't

987
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:50,640
know where to start

988
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,469
start with Marcus's and and start

989
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,569
co-leading them I am being a kind of a

990
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,640
cool project to like collate the mailing

991
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,469
lists and the answers that have have

992
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,119
been on there not like not just like

993
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,259
buying the mailing lists together but

994
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:03,599
actually like actually curate it their

995
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,660
entry into you into a textbook I think

996
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,160
it's actually there I think the past 15

997
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,029
years you're getting radio a mailing

998
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:10,650
list if you if you some somebody can

999
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,489
actually figure out how to go through

1000
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,529
and curate that thing and that's you

1001
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:16,109
know the the theories there the math is

1002
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:18,269
there the that's the the nature Guinea

1003
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:19,769
radio is there it just takes some of

1004
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:21,089
these mindset to go in there and

1005
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:23,069
actually and pull it out for us I think

1006
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:35,400
it'd be kind of cool concerning that

1007
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,630
textbook issue do you think it's

1008
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,059
necessary to write the textbook

1009
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:47,430
concerning VSP specifically for new

1010
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,430
radio or do you think it might be better

1011
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,130
to just point people to something like

1012
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,150
the DSP guide

1013
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,440
what are you thought your thoughts on

1014
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,789
that it's a great question

1015
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,499
DSP versus the generative thing and

1016
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:08,819
that's what that is the trouble I got

1017
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:10,769
into I tried to write here's how using

1018
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,119
radio here's how you use a fir filter

1019
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,559
what if you don't know what a fir filter

1020
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,849
is okay here's the math behind a fir

1021
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:17,269
filter and part of the one of the the

1022
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,160
forks I went off on was I've started to

1023
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,719
write an intro two columns textbook and

1024
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,849
there's already 50 of them out there

1025
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:25,709
some of them are great many of them are

1026
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,769
but some of them are great so it's so I

1027
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:29,849
actually don't know the answer to that

1028
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,190
yet I think it's that is a valid

1029
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,069
question to kind of keep in the air okay

1030
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:41,999
so I just want to add what Ben said I

1031
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:44,160
think so just very quickly I think

1032
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,650
universities should kind of introduce a

1033
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,779
student to new radio tell them about

1034
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,700
that there are so many cool small

1035
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,349
that you can do like receiving your

1036
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,260
coffee key fob or the airplane stuff and

1037
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,359
then make them aware of the project and

1038
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,740
once they are on the website

1039
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,630
I think this list that Ben mentioned of

1040
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,359
some low-hanging fruits that allow a new

1041
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,130
people to see what's what can be done

1042
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,769
like the JavaScript or piping or cute

1043
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,529
whatever so to allow them to make a

1044
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:12,510
first small contribution and have a good

1045
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,309
experience because from my personal

1046
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,710
experience I followed open-source

1047
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,630
projects for a very long time but didn't

1048
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,339
really contribute because I was a bit

1049
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,799
afraid of it and then once I I came into

1050
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,339
it they were very very welcoming and

1051
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:28,230
everybody was I was nice I think it's

1052
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,650
really the have a good first step in the

1053
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,599
door and this I think that's really

1054
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,980
important okay

1055
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,359
this panel has been frustrating in the

1056
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,069
sense that we I think we started a cool

1057
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,480
conversation and now I have to cancel

1058
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,890
and I'll call it off because we have

1059
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,470
more presentations coming in I would

1060
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,470
urge people to continue so for example

1061
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,059
if you could hang around I'd like to

1062
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,789
talk to you and I'm sure Ben or Tom

1063
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:58,890
might also like to talk to you you know

1064
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,630
if there's any more questions I feel

1065
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,549
like if this panels are one thing is

1066
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:03,930
sort of expose a couple of people who

1067
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,609
are interested in various topics so you

1068
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,230
know we can talk about standalone app

1069
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,789
store at least we know I know each

1070
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:11,160
other's faces now I'm afraid that's all

1071
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,380
we can do for now I'd like to thank the

1072
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,790
panel

1073
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,840
[Applause]

1074
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:20,058
you
