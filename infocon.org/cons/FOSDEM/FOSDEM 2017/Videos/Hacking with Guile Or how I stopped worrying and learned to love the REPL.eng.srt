1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,430
here so I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,920
basically hacking in guile its

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,270
programming in Gow it's kind of more of

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,879
an introductory session we'll cover that

6
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,070
in a little in a second I have to make

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,630
some smart slight adaptations to my kind

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,670
of fullscreen setup so where hopefully

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,260
it should work out well see how it goes

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,480
first of all yeah my name is Alex Osman

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,580
thousand kind of work for PT FS Europe

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,160
and I get to work on a kind of library

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,149
management system which is used by

14
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,129
public and academic libraries which is

15
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:38,379
free software so I'm very lucky in that

16
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:44,409
respect so getting started just to gauge

17
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,640
kind of the experience in the room like

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,329
who here has programmed in gaol before

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,479
Wow okay so yeah this is an introductory

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,499
session some of it you may already know

21
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,319
but so you programmed in gal who here is

22
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,109
you know has done like a larger project

23
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,879
or anything that got in got like is that

24
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,860
okay so that's that's fewer okay that's

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,180
good and who feels really comfortable

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,630
working in guile okay you mean the girl

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:20,859
maintainer is like maybe okay so I would

28
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,539
say I'm relatively comfortable and guile

29
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,780
for sure but so maybe what we're gonna

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,210
cover in this presentation is like the

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,859
bare basics and then kind of maybe

32
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,420
seeing how we can kind of improve our

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,969
workflow and I guess maybe also like

34
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,990
towards the end we have time hopefully

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,880
we might be able to kind of share some

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,009
ideas or share some tips about stuff

37
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,310
that we do a work force we have we'll

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,950
see where we go down here this will

39
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,289
become relevant later you should be able

40
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,549
to see making commands this is when are

41
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,560
we using Emacs in a second but for now

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,429
it's probably not that important so

43
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,390
first things about girl this is probably

44
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,070
I can skip the basically it's it's a

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,990
skew invitation which is a lisp dialect

46
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,640
and that means that there's obviously

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
lots of parentheses which are wonderful

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,109
creatures and there's you can also use

49
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,369
this thing called wisp

50
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,210
written by someone called RNA and that's

51
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,200
kind of a way and I think there's a

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,940
presentation out that later on it's kind

53
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,400
of a way to kind of turn essentially

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,470
turn scheme into a less apparent

55
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,840
see language which is quite neat

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,100
actually to be honest fact that it's

57
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,300
possible but I like my parentheses so

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,640
installing our debian like this Jose is

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,670
super easy and own geeks and gives a see

60
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,980
of course is super easy as well so it's

61
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,890
straightforward can skip that a quick

62
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,660
aside so one of the big things about

63
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,190
scheme languages and Lisp in general I

64
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,440
guess our rebels and basically they're

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,690
kind of a stand for read eval print loop

66
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,430
so they're basically just interactive

67
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,900
prompts much like your shell and it's

68
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,430
it's kind of a place to evaluate your

69
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,020
commands and most kind of high level

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,540
languages nowadays have them at work by

71
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,970
programming in Perl and also some PHP

72
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,980
neither of which are particularly known

73
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,890
for their apples so working that's one

74
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,820
of the reasons why I like working in

75
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,200
guile is because you know I have access

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,209
to the repple because it's it's great so

77
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,040
but most most languages most kind of

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,150
high level languages nowadays where we

79
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,150
have them so somebody firing up the

80
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,410
repple super easy it's as easy as kind

81
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,770
of one sky was installed kind of just

82
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,700
executing the velcome on and you get a

83
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,840
wrapper we already saw that before

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,019
Ricardo's presentation by default it's a

85
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,670
bit Spartan like I can obviously you

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,079
know execute commands

87
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,210
sure why not let's go with it yeah it's

88
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,160
displayed there you can see it

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,640
I should probably kind of go for so I've

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
just kind of tried to press you can see

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,220
on yeah I've just tried to press the

92
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,440
up-arrow thinking oh I could get my

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,390
history up but no we doesn't sound rebel

94
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,910
doesn't come with a history so it's like

95
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,040
I say it's a bit Spartan but you can

96
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,870
basically use it it's a it's a rebel

97
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,890
okay

98
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,660
there we go so yeah it's parking by

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,740
default which is a bit meh but we can

100
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,370
approve it because by default comes with

101
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,330
basically a library which is called read

102
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,770
line

103
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,839
so first of all kind of execute like

104
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,310
like eMac like Emacs basically the

105
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,140
valuates kind of a start-up file which

106
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,140
is in GAO's case with named pure guile

107
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,790
and it comes with the standard library

108
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,400
called read line and you can also

109
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
there's a separate project called

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,570
colorize written by Nala which is kind

111
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,419
of just as pretty colors so I'm quickly

112
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,830
gonna enable those

113
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,599
[Music]

114
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,770
don't work

115
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,840
there we are

116
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,630
diarrhea that's better

117
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,780
so just kind of tweaked my pre-prepared

118
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,230
cow

119
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,380
guinea fowl and now running it first of

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,730
all as I mean this is just basically

121
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,320
like you know a demonstration as it's a

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
it's a pure scheme file so you can

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,450
basically write whatever you want in

124
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,230
there if you want to do some kind of

125
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,910
fancy computations but before the rapid

126
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,890
fires up that's fine you can do that but

127
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,270
the main thing is I've been able to

128
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,440
colorize library so you've got pretty

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
colors there now and I also have a

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,930
history now and it's part of history red

131
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,400
line also provides obviously kind of

132
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,110
backward search and so I got so already

133
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,100
the repple immediate becomes a lot

134
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,540
better so out of the box the sorting

135
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,190
dial if you want to use go the first

136
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,060
thing I recommend it's definitely

137
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,110
everything read line it makes a massive

138
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,810
difference in terms of using the repple

139
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,390
and then after that I mean you even get

140
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,650
parent matching which is lovely if

141
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,780
you're kind of doing deep indentation so

142
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,480
yeah just I'm a triple skip that anyway

143
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,390
but it's so I guess that's the first

144
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,000
thing to do and I guess at that point it

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,830
might be kind of worth talking I'm not

146
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,000
her potential but it's worth talking

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,170
about this because again this is super

148
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,520
introductory based in kind of the guy'll

149
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,930
repple comes with some meta commands

150
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,570
which are super useful and they kind of

151
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,850
a prefix to the comma so you have help

152
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,800
which is basically just kind of a like

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,190
contextual help command I guess there's

154
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,140
apropos which is much like apropos on

155
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,520
the shell basically provides you with

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,410
kind of a search through kind of loaded

157
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,590
bindings binding which basically just

158
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,730
displays all the bindings that are

159
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,600
currently loaded described which is kind

160
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,940
of like a way to interactively query the

161
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,430
documentation strains from functions

162
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,840
like Emacs Lisp and Python as well in

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,940
other languages gal basically allows the

164
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,560
chart documentation screen strings

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,600
directly to procedures so you can query

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,150
those like this and it's pretty print

167
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,860
which is you know quite useful when

168
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,410
you're just interactively debugging or

169
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,260
messing around and finally module and

170
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,150
reloads are basically just kind of

171
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,710
shorthand commands for kind of loading

172
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,330
new libraries that already installed in

173
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,900
the system so I don't know

174
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,630
yeah I should probably start my couple

175
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,810
first

176
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,530
it's apropos just listen up and I can

177
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,080
say okay well let's find out what palm

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,099
up dusted the deer stands for describe

179
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,180
doesn't have documentation string okay

180
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,080
let's go for there we go so that's it's

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,150
a nice way to kind of at the wrap we'll

182
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,940
get some extra information I can load

183
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,780
let's go for

184
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,530
and actually model kind of switches into

185
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,150
a new module so now right now I'm kind

186
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,040
of inside there sir free sir free one

187
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,350
module sir free one it's like it just a

188
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,610
really useful general-purpose kind of

189
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,720
scheme library that adds lots of

190
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,730
wonderful things for processing lists

191
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,650
and so on so from here I could then say

192
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,010
you know binding and I can actually have

193
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,370
a look at all the procedures essentially

194
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,280
of this module provides so it's kind of

195
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
a way to like just have to wrap will

196
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,740
explore your kind of code base

197
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,980
essentially or your procedures and stuff

198
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,890
so yeah metal commands quite useful and

199
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,670
but actually when you actually working

200
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,620
on a project of course you kind of you

201
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,640
know you've got your rebel that you kind

202
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,960
of can interactively play with but your

203
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,100
most of the time you're working in a

204
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,950
text editor presumably so and most

205
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,480
accelerators will support the kind of

206
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,640
syntax highlighting for scheme so in

207
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,760
gnome using gedit is fine you can see

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,370
pretty syntax highlighting and you can

209
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,740
just add it from here so

210
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,300
hey that's ansari out there so running

211
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,190
obviously script files as well just was

212
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,440
a s flag indian location

213
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,240
but yeah let's face it it's still

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,000
prepare bones it's not not an ideal

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
development environment

216
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,410
so really the moment at the moment the

217
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,870
way to develop car projects is in Emacs

218
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,699
I mean Emacs in general is a great text

219
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,100
editor and for editing Gao is basically

220
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,170
the way to go so the first thing you

221
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,759
want to do is install Emacs and guys

222
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,759
here and Debian it's both again like

223
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,079
most major distribution probly uploading

224
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,209
both a package in Debian the usual

225
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,709
commands and Geeks you can also do with

226
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,980
you know commands for geeks and then you

227
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,620
can just open your ghoul script so I've

228
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,959
got it open here and then the cool thing

229
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,910
is that you can basically execute run

230
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,339
and guile and then you basically get

231
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,579
your Apple inside Emacs and at that

232
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,069
point basically you have inside Emacs

233
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,540
without any tweaking like the better

234
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,589
version of the wrapper with the kind of

235
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,089
a history with you know backward search

236
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,899
or whatever you want to do

237
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,119
so that rep already is pretty you know

238
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:16,169
pretty massive improvement but then it's

239
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,459
not just the repple I mean you get them

240
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,839
to sign and meta commands as well so of

241
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,889
course they work from it within here

242
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,299
because this is just a wrapper around to

243
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,309
kind of you know the actual gout process

244
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:28,049
that's running in the background so so

245
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:29,100
it's a fully featured rapper out of the

246
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,850
box but you get awesome more stuff you

247
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,470
get like within the buffer kind of

248
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,619
evaluation or email of girl code much

249
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,789
like if you've used the matter before

250
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,499
you know like evaluating a list within

251
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,119
buffers is something that you can

252
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,039
totally do and that's the same with with

253
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,139
gallows well basically the experience of

254
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,419
programming guile in Emacs essentially

255
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,289
becomes very much the same as

256
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,220
programming a lisp in Emacs so you can

257
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,379
live coding you get immediate access to

258
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,660
doc strings and because kind of the

259
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,539
documentation is written info or check

260
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,549
info you can basically immediately

261
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:04,169
access that at your fingertips is all

262
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,929
from within Emacs so let's look at this

263
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,589
one here I've loaded this file I've got

264
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:13,709
my rap will open basically I'm gonna go

265
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,989
four guys here Evo buffer and what is

266
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,189
some basic it's just kind of taking this

267
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,689
buffer and just evolved in the in the

268
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,609
raffle you don't actually see the output

269
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,619
but it's done it and the reason that I

270
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,859
know that is for example if I now hover

271
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:31,499
over this procedure here and I use

272
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,720
control-c EDD I basically can

273
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,220
immediately access the documentation for

274
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,429
it the doc string in this case but for

275
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,029
let's say match which is a built in kind

276
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,009
of well it's actually exported by the

277
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,899
match library I can do the same thing

278
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,389
against EDD and then I should be able to

279
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,539
hopefully works click on manual and

280
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,559
there we go I go to the right chapter in

281
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,609
the manual and immediately get full

282
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:56,759
documentation to that which again beats

283
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,439
my experience of working with Perl and

284
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,389
PHP of manually having to look up

285
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,319
various things

286
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,560
so that's one thing the other thing as

287
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,270
well as as I started writing obviously

288
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,520
like editing text in Emacs or Lisp in

289
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,050
Emacs is so much better than any other

290
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,240
text editor that I've come across so the

291
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,950
whole kind of its is the eye by

292
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,150
comparison working and get it or some

293
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:30,550
that is painful can we see it

294
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,380
owning the mini Beaufort puffers hidden

295
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,230
just one second I'm just gonna resize

296
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,320
things a little bit more and a little

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,560
more

298
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,350
it refuses to become smaller

299
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,930
down here is the famous outer side is

300
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,180
the famous Emacs mini buffer which if

301
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,620
you've used Emacs you probably know

302
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,280
about in you having having guys enable

303
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,440
basically it gives you whilst you're

304
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,380
typing I can see it here it's wonderful

305
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,940
it gives you basically like the

306
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,560
procedure signatures after typing them

307
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
so basically you can immediately there

308
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,020
see what kind of arguments the procedure

309
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,810
expects which is super useful again so

310
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,350
that's the other thing we can basically

311
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,380
evaluate procedure calls from within the

312
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,940
buffer so I'm now basically pressing

313
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,030
control X E and you can see basically it

314
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,080
immediately evaluates and it kind of

315
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,730
buffer next to it so this is what I

316
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,020
meant before with like basically buffer

317
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,130
evaluation in life code and you can

318
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,990
essentially just write a new procedure

319
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,960
definition inside the buffer and then

320
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,460
evaluate it and then immediately

321
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,690
testicle within the buffer without

322
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,280
having to switch over to a different

323
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,320
kind of test situation or running the

324
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,400
script and hoping that everything works

325
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,140
out fine which is I know just great it

326
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,430
just feels really nice to work out that

327
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,640
way

328
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,189
so there are all hosts of kind of geyser

329
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,209
commands the most important ones

330
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,040
probably like evil buffer and go which

331
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,369
is basically like evaluate the buffer

332
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,079
and then kind of switch to the repple

333
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,309
where you have access to the stuff so

334
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,619
again in the wrapper I have access to my

335
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:44,759
functions that I'm defining there is

336
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:53,139
guys ear evil last sex P which basically

337
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,779
is like it just like that's what I did

338
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:56,980
before it just kind of evaluates the

339
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,259
last kind of firm s expression that you

340
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:04,990
are at and I guess guys here if our

341
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,910
region is quite useful as well just

342
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,619
market region and evaluate that so

343
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:09,999
basically let's just say within your

344
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,069
kind of code file and just kind of

345
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,600
evaluate partial parts of the code to

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,309
kind of see you know you see something

347
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,600
goes wrong you kind of quickly tweak it

348
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,279
and you evaluate it again see if it

349
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,350
works then it's a really nice way of

350
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,470
working basically so yeah way better

351
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,550
than the standard repple and the

352
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,860
standard text editor so working on a

353
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,670
larger project

354
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,949
I mean basically we kind of have pretty

355
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:37,360
good stuff like what I've shown so far

356
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,290
it's pretty good stuff to kind of work

357
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,670
on scripts and so on single contained

358
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,370
files to work on a project essentially

359
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,379
by and large this kind of would be I

360
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,850
think probably representative kind of

361
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,980
layout for a kind of gal project you'd

362
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,339
basically have your before which is kind

363
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,899
of the project name essentially within

364
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,069
that you might have had another folder

365
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,240
which is kind of called the same and

366
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,499
that kind of contains support like

367
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:58,809
modules for your project and then you've

368
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,490
got your main kind of project file let's

369
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,899
say and then you've got a tests folder

370
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,860
with some test files in it

371
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,339
and of course basically like in in in

372
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,470
gal you basically define modules with

373
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,370
the defined module form at the top of

374
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,459
kind of a module file and it can

375
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,870
basically names the module and kind of

376
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,430
exports procedures and you kind of

377
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,120
define what modules are using and of

378
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,560
course if you have a project which kind

379
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,420
of has several layers of directories

380
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,339
deep as you're working on the project in

381
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,529
guys here you want to be able to use all

382
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,730
the procedures that you have to find

383
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,790
deeper down in your project and the way

384
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,709
to do that basically is what if you try

385
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,520
to do that just normally you're

386
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,620
essentially gonna get an error in guys

387
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,690
here because okay so basically loads

388
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,300
guy'll from within the load path and a

389
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,339
load path by default does not contain

390
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,480
your project file so really you need to

391
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,380
basically that's the only thing you need

392
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,580
to remember when you're kind of working

393
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,620
on a project in in guy'll with k easier

394
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,209
if you basically use the guys here add

395
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,950
load load after load path command

396
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,210
and by default it will just kind of

397
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,829
assume the director that you're in and

398
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,470
then from now onwards let's switch to my

399
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,480
other example No

400
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,550
well there example there we go

401
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,649
[Music]

402
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,020
so yeah I'm just quickly going to switch

403
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:44,030
to my report and restart it okay

404
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,140
okay so right now it's the fresh ripple

405
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,270
I looked on the battle outlook lope a

406
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,220
thing yet so if I do this it will say

407
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,140
that code doesn't exist it's not in the

408
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,190
low path because it doesn't know about

409
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,050
the project so instead I'm going to

410
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:02,180
quickly run the load path command and

411
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,830
now it's working fine and now basically

412
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,900
this so I'm using the kind of p.m.

413
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,470
support module which is in p.m. support

414
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,080
it kind of is really simple doesn't do

415
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,390
much but there's the procedure that

416
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,980
called text text to greeting and you can

417
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,950
see that this one uses here so I can

418
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,140
evaluate that and I can do the same

419
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,370
thing again it's a different

420
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,980
implementation of the same program still

421
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,430
cloudy

422
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,020
this is Belgium and it works again so

423
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,340
and that's basically how you can

424
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,630
basically work on projects and go you

425
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,100
just add too low path thank you

426
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,810
so yeah conclusion basically really the

427
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,910
D way to work at the moment on the owl

428
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,560
projects is using the interactive

429
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,670
grapple in as gaze ear inside you max

430
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,010
together with live coding in buffers and

431
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,270
then kind of access you into the

432
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,010
documentation that's by far the best way

433
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,560
to work on it

434
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,520
and that's kind of what I wanted to

435
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,030
cover my introduction so I don't know

436
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,520
like I think it's worth maybe like

437
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
thinking about it well first of all you

438
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
have comments or questions I can I'm

439
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
only happy to kind of talk a little bit

440
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,140
about things that maybe I went through

441
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,660
too fast or whatever but if not I have a

442
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,420
few comments as well possibly about I

443
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,160
think we're gal should go in order to

444
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,510
kind of make it slightly more use user

445
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,640
friendly but I think a lot of that has

446
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,290
been talked about already previous year

447
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,240
and also in the Ricardos presentation

448
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
for instance and John's presentations

449
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,210
well a little bit okay first of all

450
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,180
anyone any comments or questions

451
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:41,580
yeah that question is slightly outside

452
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,250
of the remit of my presentation I don't

453
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,420
know I think there's some awesome work

454
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,600
that exists and and if young geeks SD

455
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
actually you can install got you max

456
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
which actually uses the basically Gao as

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,540
the backend for right yeah I mean that

458
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,520
exactly yeah so don't know there's

459
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,140
depending we talked to there's more or

460
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,640
less excitement about it a lot of people

461
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,380
knew max probably quite understandably

462
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,090
are very concerned about the you know

463
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,650
it's a massive project basically and are

464
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,940
quite concerned about the amazing

465
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,080
stability of Emacs and what the

466
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,490
consequences would be on the other end

467
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,600
there it's really cool you know it's

468
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,890
just an inspiring project in a way so

469
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,600
we'll see what happens that's my

470
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,210
personal opinion

471
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,500
yeah any other questions

472
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,470
oh sorry

473
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,990
so do I use any kind of other IDE

474
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,050
features like debuggers or things like

475
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:43,290
that so by and large I one form or less

476
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,000
in like basically script based debugging

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,680
mostly though and that's kind of the

478
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,810
technique that I use most of the time

479
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,190
but for a guy out that mean there's the

480
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,570
debugger that's built into the repple as

481
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,070
well so we gaze you basically do get

482
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,260
access to the growl debugger as well I

483
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,330
didn't want to go into that at all this

484
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,920
presentation because it's kind of a talk

485
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,230
in itself really like how to use it but

486
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,490
yeah from within Emacs you have access

487
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,680
to that debugger and you can do

488
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,470
debugging that way all the ID like

489
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,570
features I mean autocomplete and code

490
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,040
completion and code you know code

491
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,650
jumping it's the regard is pretty much

492
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,810
all available via courier as well you

493
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,250
can combine gaze here with company mode

494
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,570
which basically gives you auto

495
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,270
completion code jumping is by default

496
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,990
enabled with cozier and there's also

497
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,760
other anything with Emacs right there's

498
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,620
a million different ways to do it so the

499
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,730
way that I do kind of for example

500
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,450
projects management in Emacs is using a

501
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,240
project little file called projectile

502
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,680
which basically allows you to switch to

503
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,970
projects and just kind of look at the

504
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,980
files within that project it's quite

505
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,900
nice

506
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,710
I think I mainly became that discussion

507
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:57,980
going to provide environment yeah yeah

508
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,940
yeah no I think that's a really valid

509
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,520
point I mean there are Emacs flavors

510
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,780
that are specifically directed towards

511
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
people's workflows I mean then

512
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,900
well-known one are things like space max

513
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,700
you know it's just kind of Emacs where

514
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,110
people come from them and just want to

515
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,330
continue using them in Emacs essentially

516
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,040
first thing I use evil and kind of have

517
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,050
a heavy customized version of Emacs but

518
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,460
but I think there's no reason why we

519
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,929
couldn't do something similar for you

520
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,820
know I have basically Emacs like an e

521
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,860
max flavor that's basically set up to

522
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,630
out of the box provider of like a

523
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,150
friendlier ID environment for for a gal

524
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,460
development that you know maybe it's

525
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,870
like more accessible to people who don't

526
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,760
come from a vim or Emacs background so

527
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,850
like you know actually provides the CUA

528
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,820
compatibility mode by default provides

529
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,929
k'sia installed by default in working

530
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:41,670
things like that and then basically we

531
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,140
can just say to people if you want to

532
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,820
start hacking on guile just you know

533
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,929
install this favor of Emacs and you're

534
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,690
good to go I forgot to repeat the

535
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,170
question the question was can we make it

536
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,650
easier essentially to make Gao hacking

537
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,130
possible new max summary I discussed

538
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,450
this already last name but I'm gonna

539
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,920
bring it up but yeah hmm what do you

540
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,750
think of the idea of providing something

541
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,090
like a doctor racket type thing but for

542
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,600
guile yeah so the question is what do I

543
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,740
think of the idea of providing a doctor

544
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,800
racket style thing but for guile I would

545
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,610
think that's amazing

546
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,980
I mean doctor racket is basically an IDE

547
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,380
and development environment for racket

548
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,080
essentially that is pretty much how

549
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,270
people start programming racket by an

550
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,040
Archon I think that kind of tooling

551
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,300
would be amazing to have for guile and

552
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,690
that's actually probably what my yeah

553
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,640
it's like problems button like not get

554
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,750
it you know problems getting into our

555
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,340
base we don't have that kind of really

556
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,590
nice I'm a new person I want to learn

557
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,600
about Gao this is the tool for you to

558
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,190
use like we don't have that kind of nice

559
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,270
sound it already and I think will be

560
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,370
amazing to have it the question is just

561
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,059
kind of how do we do it

562
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,440
or you know where do we get the energy

563
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,389
to it that's her that's more the

564
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,330
question any other questions

565
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,289
okay yes I would just kind of want to

566
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:00,600
add that I think and I think like Chris

567
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,980
has started in this as well like I think

568
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,470
having a nice kind of interactive

569
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,029
tutorial or kind of user journey journey

570
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,679
or a story for people kind of start

571
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,360
using guile will be really nice to have

572
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,059
as well because the documentation for

573
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,740
how is absolutely amazing but it's

574
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,330
definitely more of a kind of reference

575
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,370
documentation rather than kind of a you

576
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,169
know this is go it's an awesome language

577
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,389
and try out you know go go with us on

578
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,710
this journey and you'll at the end of it

579
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,990
you'll be a a gal hacker essentially and

580
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,889
I think will be really nice to be able

581
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,159
to provide people with that as well like

582
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,179
one of the downsides that I think at the

583
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,950
moment girl has really is and before I

584
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,909
talked about that a little bit at the

585
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:34,769
panel I think Ludwig mentioned it that

586
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:37,379
basically like other cool and hip

587
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,119
languages have language specific package

588
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,039
managers which have pros and cons one of

589
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,480
the pros is that it become so much more

590
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,399
so much easier to kind of discover code

591
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,869
that is out there and just installing it

592
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:47,820
and using it and gal doesn't have that

593
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,860
at the moment and it's a it's a shame

594
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,480
because there's like tons of code out

595
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,480
there that no one knows about and these

596
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,769
to a certain extent tors address that

597
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:59,340
but I mean geeks is a bit heavy for just

598
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,450
like if you're just interested in just

599
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,820
you know just gal packages pieces a bit

600
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,690
heavy probably so yeah

601
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,700
that's all I have if you are interested

602
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,049
in kind of getting help like you're just

603
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,159
starting to work and go and you're kind

604
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,779
of interested in getting help the IRA

605
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,570
scene chat is really user friendly

606
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,399
my name is a on there although I'm not

607
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,289
very often on there I must say the main

608
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,519
list of super nice as well

609
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,549
documentation is fantastic and some of

610
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,210
us hire on Twitter

611
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,780
finally before I leave the place here

612
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,860
we're organizing new hackers meeting

613
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,380
this summer anyone are welcome to come

614
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,090
it's a really cool thing it's like three

615
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,210
days in Germany at this time and

616
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,130
basically you should check it out that

617
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,490
URL and sign up if you're interested

618
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,590
thank you very much

619
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:54,240
[Applause]
