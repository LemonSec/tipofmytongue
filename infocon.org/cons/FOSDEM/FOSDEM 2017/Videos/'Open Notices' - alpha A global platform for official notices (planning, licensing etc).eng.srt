1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,710
but

2
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,410
hello everyone I think it's one o'clock

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,070
so it's not good so my name is Richard

4
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,360
Pope I'm a designer and technologist and

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,010
I've had a kind of long-running interest

6
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,410
in civic information local information

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,420
planning applications that could hang so

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,149
I'm here today to talk about a project

9
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,409
I've been working on which is nearly

10
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,210
ready to go it's not quite as finished

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,579
as I would like done this that it's

12
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,829
nearly there good local notices to org

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,059
and it's a Commons a platform for

14
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,160
specific notices as the aim for projects

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,539
so when I talk a bit about civic notices

16
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,199
I think I'll give you a demo of the

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,289
product and show you the API and maybe

18
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,030
talk a bit about the code behind it if

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,060
there's time so this is a kind of story

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,200
about about lampposts and about Commons

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,140
so I'm not sure how you see these a lot

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,539
in the UK they're planning applications

23
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:29,170
tied to lamp posts on streets this is

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,390
from your voice which kind of just about

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,250
time gently related is I think where

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,619
some of the early OpenStreetMap activity

27
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,540
happened

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,640
and they kind of tell you give you full

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,850
warning and an opportunity to contribute

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,740
to a proposed development plan I saw

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,860
this one on Friday in in Brussels for

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,689
some reason blown up it was huge like

33
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,990
attached to the wall of the building

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,610
my French is not bigger but I'm hoping

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,289
that is also a planning application it

36
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,310
looked like it was it's another one it's

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,140
kind of lots of local authorities have

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,969
started to try and digitize these they

39
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,619
put QR codes on them there's kind of a

40
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,449
web application of it but they're very

41
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,810
much like a paper analog of it's already

42
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,060
digital analog of a paper process you

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,989
can kind of go and find the information

44
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,959
online but it's not really a it's really

45
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,410
kind of good raw information and this is

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,829
a pattern that kind of pops up a lot in

47
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,750
local governments I mean local

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,579
information we use the spaces of

49
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,769
notifying the public giving them an

50
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,560
opportunity within a window to up to

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,180
give their thoughts on something so we

52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,100
can use it for when people who clean

53
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,380
about building new things opening pubs

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,780
opening restaurants if a roads going to

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,360
be closed

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,530
kind of more general consultations

57
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,959
trying to get people's input on on local

58
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,760
plans and also kind of like less

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,740
directly government related ones so

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,200
things like a food bank needs items from

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,480
the local public or maybe there's

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,310
opportunities to volunteer there's this

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,440
kind of recurring pattern of giving the

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,130
public the option of contributing to

65
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,950
something to something which is kind of

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,820
geographically bounded I think that

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,670
pattern comes up a lot for this reason

68
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,709
the information about our communities is

69
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,000
important to the functioning of those

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,910
communities we put these things in place

71
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,400
as a society to look to it to make us to

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,630
make our communities better and stronger

73
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,220
hopefully so you have you have the

74
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
ability as a citizen to be able to take

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,209
part in your local community and

76
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,160
actually have a kind of despite mostly

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,600
being like paper-based they have a lot

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,650
of a characteristics of a kind of

79
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,670
digital Commons this is a quote chose to

80
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,380
define what a digital Commons is and it

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,900
kind of has things in it like shared

82
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,150
data shared collectively between the

83
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,709
community orientated to reuse rather

84
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,010
than exchange the community has the

85
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,299
opportunity to in the intervening the

86
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,650
governance of it I think there's a

87
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,820
there's a lot of overlap between these

88
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,739
kind of these processes we have in city

89
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,900
and local government and kind of more

90
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,900
broad digital Commons so I've enjoyed I

91
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,019
think like what is the equivalent of a

92
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,120
la sawing on a lamppost in the digital

93
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,239
age

94
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,350
there we go there we go and thinking a

95
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,600
lot about other examples of digital

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,710
Commons that are out there so if

97
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,990
Wikipedia is a kind of a Commons of

98
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,060
agreed knowledge and OpenStreetMap which

99
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,870
you've been hearing about it's kind of

100
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,160
like a commons of things you can trip

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
over in the real world it's kind of like

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,650
it's a representation of the physical

103
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,900
world Wikimedia Commons its kind of

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,120
photos Media opencorporates is a open

105
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,070
database of companies and company

106
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,830
ownership so I'm wondering can we build

107
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,860
a civic Commons of City a digital

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,510
Commons or Civic notices and why

109
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,340
for this reason really like I'm kind of

110
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,530
this works based on a hypothesis I want

111
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,910
to test which is like if we improve the

112
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,920
quality and quantity of look of

113
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,240
information in our communities can we

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,320
make those communities better and

115
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,320
stronger because I worry that if we

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,540
continue to rely on red to the analog

117
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,120
methods of consultation informing people

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,830
we don't take that information to where

119
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,750
people actually are then we risk

120
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,510
undermining trust further on further

121
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,850
undermining trust in our our Civic

122
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,500
institutions which i think is something

123
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,090
that we should all be worrying about at

124
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,870
the moment so slightly rough going there

125
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,520
but I'm kind of imagining if we have

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,290
were we have like good open data and

127
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,260
good quality data about civic notices we

128
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,610
can use we use that information anyway

129
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,680
so we might keep on printing things on

130
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
lampposts we might attach it

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,400
automatically to the receipts in in

132
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
supermarkets we might automatically post

133
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,230
it to local groups on Facebook you can

134
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,460
imagine good when you buy or rent a

135
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,900
house maybe information is automatically

136
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,650
dragged into that process or if a couple

137
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,850
of questions about routing apps earlier

138
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,050
if you're trying to draw if you're

139
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,540
trying to plan a route from A to B and

140
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,060
you can find out that the roads closed

141
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,050
for some reason and you could

142
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,310
potentially service that information in

143
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,560
there does that make sense so far good

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,430
so I will endeavour to show you a demo

145
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,950
of where rats at the moment so

146
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,699
I'll try to show you they're kind of a

147
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,500
characteristics of Bob I'll try to show

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,020
you what this product does at the moment

149
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,610
and some of the characteristics of the

150
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,930
data then talk a bit about the API

151
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,160
underneath it so it's currently two

152
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,540
notices in this at the moment so we've

153
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,290
got one here which is an application for

154
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,580
a license an alcohol license so we have

155
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,320
a location and we have a bunch of data

156
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,120
about it

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,100
so who the applicant is what the address

158
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,919
is and then that information is

159
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,389
available in various formats I'll come

160
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,830
back to that later and we've got another

161
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,660
example here which is actually items

162
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,729
needed by a local food bank so again the

163
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,200
location and then the items that are

164
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,490
needed that's available to structured

165
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:18,450
data I will show you what it is like to

166
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,370
add a notice now so I'm going to put the

167
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,630
fact that the road outside here is

168
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,760
closed because there's food carts in its

169
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,790
and we'll have Toit so this is kind of

170
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,230
similar to the OpenStreetMap style of

171
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,480
tagging so try I'm trying to create

172
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,250
something that is relatively little B

173
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:53,840
blank canvas and then we could put other

174
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,380
things in there if it was applicable and

175
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,240
we're then gonna go out add that to the

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,389
map

177
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:21,910
so we're down here now the the data

178
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,860
inside local notices which I'll show you

179
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,720
in a minute is generally key values

180
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,880
attached to a geometry of some sort so

181
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,470
it could be a point which was the two

182
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,690
previous examples I gave you or in the

183
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,200
instance of a road it could be a line it

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
could be a line string so it could

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,610
equally be the outline of a building if

186
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,280
it was less that so we'll add that in we

187
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,750
then have the concept of a start on an

188
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,150
end date so this is kind of broadly when

189
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,820
might it be of interest to people so

190
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,980
that would probably be between well

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,870
yesterday actually poorly today and

192
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,290
tomorrow I've got timezone rights and

193
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,310
then we've published it and then that

194
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,080
information is a bit is then available

195
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,360
as embarrassed of performance and you

196
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,600
can kind of see the format there so

197
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
we've got a look we've got a location

198
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,050
which would be various types we've got a

199
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,320
title we've got a description we've got

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
these key values and then we've got a

201
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,470
start and end point everything I think

202
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,430
you can pretty much model everything

203
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,550
like that I will come back talk about

204
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,530
that again in a moment

205
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,070
oh it's one of the other features so

206
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,270
that's all very nice helm what you find

207
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,810
out about that there's also a very very

208
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,490
basic alerting service built-in so if

209
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,900
you care about things where you live or

210
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,380
where you work it is possible to go and

211
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,470
create to say I care about things

212
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,499
roughly in this area I can create an

213
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,720
alert and then that will send me emails

214
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,410
of anything any new notices that

215
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,279
intersect with that polygon there and

216
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,629
again though that information is also

217
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,540
available as a in very as by our API is

218
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,379
embarrass feeds so you can see here

219
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:26,769
hopefully we have some data fine

220
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:32,299
so my hope is that the that most people

221
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,649
won't use that user interface to

222
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,179
actually get data into this I'm kind of

223
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,980
hoping they're more there for example at

224
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,709
for an example and for the purposes of

225
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,029
kind of getting some seed data in there

226
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,279
long term I'm hoping that the main way

227
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,929
that people will use this will be viral

228
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:50,660
API so I will use this as a bit of an

229
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,489
opportunity to explain some of the data

230
00:10:52,489 --> 00:11:00,619
that's a bit more so using this format

231
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:09,819
here so if we do know sorry

232
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,040
okay let's see if we can find the one

233
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,470
that we just added a second ago okay so

234
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,699
as you can see here this is the four

235
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:28,480
again so it's every notice has a title

236
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,069
description a bunch of arbitrary tags

237
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:35,110
but everything has the location

238
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,970
everything has a start and then end date

239
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,040
because that then allows you to those

240
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,569
actors indexes so you can say show me

241
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,149
all the things that I care about within

242
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,620
this area or show me all things within

243
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,660
this time frame so everything has a kind

244
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,250
of a spatial on a temporal dimension to

245
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,800
it and it is also than also that the

246
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,050
format by which we I'm hoping will get

247
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,839
most of the data into this so rather

248
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,069
than people coming along typing them

249
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,949
individually will start getting people

250
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,959
writing screen scrapers taking data from

251
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,790
a local local government websites and

252
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,560
importing it in and potentially also

253
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,870
local local authorities local government

254
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,879
publishing data directly into this

255
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,680
platform and using it as a way of

256
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,550
engaging with local citizens just to

257
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,910
show you briefly we figure out how it's

258
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,230
made and what that looks like underneath

259
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,490
so it's a geo Gengo app using posters

260
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,579
this is the model for a notice so again

261
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,079
you can kind of see if these got a title

262
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,240
in the description got a location which

263
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,250
can be various geometry types a start

264
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,259
and end date and then it series of tags

265
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,029
which is stored as an H store field and

266
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,129
post just say to me briefly about time

267
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,720
zones as well I have to solve a time

268
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
zone a long side update time fill

269
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,309
because when you're thinking about the

270
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,019
the correct time zones that is the one

271
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,339
which the person who posted a notice

272
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,160
believes it to be so if you happen to be

273
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,250
in London

274
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,930
you probably want that to be local GMT

275
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,279
time but you might not maybe it's a

276
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,809
group of like a group of American expats

277
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,069
meeting up and they want to do it the

278
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,589
different time zone that's not the best

279
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,769
example had there but it's

280
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,569
I kind of came to conclude he has the

281
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,959
Stuber time zone alongside the dates the

282
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,639
stack other than that it's mostly just a

283
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,249
standard Django app the mapping is using

284
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:38,319
open layers three and it uses the geo

285
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:46,179
coder that maps and provide so that's

286
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,420
kind of where I'm at at the moment bits

287
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,519
of a road map hoping to launch a kind of

288
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,439
geofence version of this in a couple of

289
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,049
places so in South London where I live

290
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,699
and in Berlin where a friend of mine

291
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,100
who's a researcher lives so it would

292
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,259
probably only be possible to post

293
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,540
notices within those small areas to

294
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,920
start with at least I won't try and get

295
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,929
like really high resolution data for a

296
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,100
couple of small areas rather than going

297
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,759
broad second thing on the road map this

298
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,230
has intentionally been built was like

299
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,850
very much as a kind of blank slate its

300
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,559
kind of hopefully quite unup in you

301
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,509
nated in its functionality and design so

302
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,519
far that's intentional because I want to

303
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,809
try and take it to people working local

304
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:29,679
government people who work in local

305
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,389
newspapers who run hyper local online

306
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,459
groups understand what they need and

307
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,230
what the hooks will be for them to use

308
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,339
it use a platform like this I need to

309
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,639
write some code libraries around the API

310
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,899
to try and make it as easy as possible

311
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,879
for people to write screen scrapers for

312
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,170
their local authority I want to be able

313
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,709
to do recurring notices so most the

314
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,269
examples I tell you they're all kind of

315
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,309
like one office in time if you think

316
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,470
about things that recur so it's up for

317
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,089
example well tell you when to put your

318
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,100
bin out if you have rubbish collection

319
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,679
where you live or if there's something

320
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,929
that happens on an annual basis you

321
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,040
won't want to go and create one of those

322
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,749
every single week or every single year I

323
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,999
want to be I'll have a type of notice

324
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,809
which understands periodicity so you can

325
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,519
say this happens every single month

326
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,410
every single week on a Tuesday whatever

327
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,949
and then finally beginning to think a

328
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,079
bit about provenance and the signing of

329
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,829
notices so this is intentionally an open

330
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,170
cut a wiki style

331
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,570
product at the moment but how do you

332
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,529
know that a a particular note is ding

333
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,360
you 'only true well one way would be if

334
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,860
you could certify that it's come from a

335
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,839
user that you trust so maybe you would

336
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,949
trust if it's coming directly from a

337
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,389
local authority from local government

338
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,449
but not from an individual and this is

339
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,160
quite an interesting problem I think for

340
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,260
any kind of open a open kind of common

341
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,910
style platform at the moment like as we

342
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,019
become more reliant on things like

343
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,760
OpenStreetMap what and we heard this in

344
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,990
the previous talk what happens when they

345
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,720
break if someone deliberately sabotage

346
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,440
is a set a series of open datasets and

347
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,510
suddenly we can't get you know but the

348
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,010
population of a large is you can't get

349
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,660
to work on time you know these things

350
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,370
are becoming increasingly critical bits

351
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,959
of infrastructure so how we understand

352
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,279
which how we assign almost like a trust

353
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
marker to individual bits of a data set

354
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,850
I think becomes increasingly important

355
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,350
so I'm trying to think about how we

356
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,329
might do that and that's about it really

357
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,060
I think there's a yeah open for

358
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,540
questions and then yeah that's it I'm

359
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:51,430
done I think I think the interesting if

360
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,139
anyone has any examples of like how it

361
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:59,220
works for Velen yes yeah

362
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,550
yes yes oh it's definitely like a

363
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,250
two-sided problem one of the one over

364
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,810
here sorry every question so the

365
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,490
question was am I gonna be thinking

366
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,959
about the consumers of data as well as

367
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,250
people putting in stuffing into the

368
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,510
system yeah I'm kind of very acutely

369
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,560
aware of it for anything like this to

370
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,080
work it needs you need to you need both

371
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,010
sides to work one thought I have so far

372
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,330
is actually potentially setting up a

373
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,540
couple of like consumer websites almost

374
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,420
just as like a test a test bed all going

375
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,910
to talk to a couple of hyperlocal

376
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,050
website so there's a couple of

377
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,160
newspapers where I live which you've got

378
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,170
really small circulations so like trying

379
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,340
to understand what they need

380
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,970
do they need something that

381
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,350
automatically renders a PDF that they

382
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,510
can put in their newspaper for example I

383
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,920
mean a bit of a bit of backstory to this

384
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,200
I about ten years ago now I built the

385
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,670
website just for planning applications

386
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,610
just for the UK and it relies purely on

387
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,190
screen scrapers and people used it it

388
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,230
was fine but it degraded over time

389
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,510
because you had individual maintained

390
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,750
screens because like just a bit became

391
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,270
too much hassle basically so I'm kind of

392
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,770
like aware for this to work it's gonna

393
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,460
need a really healthy ecosystem on both

394
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,600
sides of them website idea anyone nope

395
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,620
good thank you very much

396
00:18:52,570 --> 00:19:11,429

397
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:18,960

398
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,679
