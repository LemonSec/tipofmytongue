1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,719
whites

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,770
so hi everyone so we are you know it's a

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,960
packager so we are in do sirs and we are

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,850
going to present our project today so

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,660
this is beer Tim and we studied this

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,279
business about three years ago so we are

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,410
doing we are hosting free software we're

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,029
doing free software as a service and we

9
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,240
say and today we're gonna explain how we

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,429
do it why we do it and what exactly we

11
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,289
do so we're going to focus more on the

12
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,699
how because I think that's what's

13
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,050
interesting you hear so the idea is that

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,699
we studied from a statement so we all

15
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,920
love free software we all promote free

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,079
software but it can be really a pain in

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,480
the ass to host it so if I'm a business

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,370
for instance and I want a cloud for

19
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,859
sharing my files calendar exit era if I

20
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,570
go to Dropbox it's super easy I just

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,210
have this signup button fill the form

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,640
and then I've got everything set up if I

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,859
want to use next cloud for instance it's

24
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,460
not the same so I've got so I just click

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,410
on get next red and I get this install

26
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,660
button download button so I have to

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,280
install it myself and that's like really

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,680
a bottleneck for 99% of the people and

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,330
that's all those people that really need

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,670
it on that we want to hurt them so we're

31
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,340
trying to do this intermediary role of

32
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,350
hosting it for yourself and integrating

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,480
it so you get just this signup button

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,790
and you can get your cloud your chat

35
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,010
your WordPress wherever you want and

36
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,020
that's pretty much our goal so as if you

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,180
go to the next road next to the website

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,710
for instance you get this signup button

39
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,720
on our dream is that you get the sign up

40
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,940
button and on every free software like

41
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,080
could be in your sort of course but it

42
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,180
could be another business so that's

43
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,580
really idea to provide easily access to

44
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,110
to this and so that's pretty much the

45
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,900
vision so now I'm gonna let

46
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,850
EF talk about most technical aspect of

47
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,120
it on how we make it happen

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,930
yes so if we just saw the conference

49
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,120
about Chatham and if you think as

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,970
Chatham as a free software they are

51
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,330
writing the draft of the protocol of how

52
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,690
chateau will be developed and the

53
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,940
project we are developing for NGOs tools

54
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,920
which is called liberal

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,700
Asajj or sh is like an implementation of

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,270
this protocol

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,310
and so some Shatan would prefer to use

58
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,830
Debian and others

59
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,800
Ubuntu Windows is not allowed because

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,190
that no is just free software right and

61
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,140
libris - is an implementation and as an

62
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,550
implementation we have strong opinion

63
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,460
about how this job should be done and we

64
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,150
did the bed

65
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,910
music on when we started to use docker

66
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,360
and luckily for us it's actually broadly

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,340
adopted nowadays and okay right now

68
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,590
libera libera sage is just on one server

69
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,680
but the idea is to transition to some

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
stuff like communities and be able to

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,090
deploy it on clusters and so I will show

72
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,960
you how it's easy to install easy to

73
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,090
install your only Asajj and so how you

74
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,040
can bootstrap easily your own shuttle

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,220
for you your family your association new

76
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,140
small and medium business or whatever ok

77
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,780
so this is the live demo time on the

78
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:31,040
comment line I'm not afraid so I just I

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,160
just start by creating a VM on the cloud

80
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,709
provider and this is in the readme of

81
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,550
Libra SH but there are also instructions

82
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,910
to install it on bare metal and then you

83
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,560
are free to make instructions for

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,380
whatever you use but to make it easier

85
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:56,090
just use a VM on distortion ok and so so

86
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,700
what I'm doing now it's actually fully

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,530
installing lib SH the system so now I

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,230
would get an IP for this server and what

89
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,180
I will do is to point all my domains to

90
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,110
this IP like it's an important step for

91
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,579
the demo to show you how we generate

92
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,400
automatically our certificates using

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,860
let's encrypt so here is the IP I go to

94
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,289
my

95
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:37,139
Jenica viral and it's awful but

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,460
OOP okay

97
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,020
so in some minutes the Janus will be

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,570
propagated and I will wait and so we

99
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:14,360
rely heavily on docker and okay so I'm

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:22,370
on the VM yeah I so do we still have to

101
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,260
manage a bit better the right so here is

102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,850
one part of the file system called

103
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,970
system and this is where we install all

104
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,520
the modules of the the system and so the

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,840
main module is the load balancer this is

106
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,480
where all the traffic the HTTP traffic

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,120
is entering so we use a proxy as a load

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,040
balancer and we have we used containers

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,810
and there is a little companion that is

110
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,750
taking care of let's encrypt so I will

111
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,850
start by installing my load balancer so

112
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,610
[Music]

113
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,680
so module is basically just a git repo

114
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,570
okay so I go there and then I just leave

115
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,620
a start so I just started my proxy I can

116
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,720
consult the journal and what you see is

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,510
that it's pulling some docker images and

118
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,540
basically everything like all the

119
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,850
packages like there are user packages

120
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,400
like web applications and modules and

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,710
everything is a git repo containing a

122
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,660
docker compose at the moment but it is

123
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,500
too migrated to kubernetes at one point

124
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,290
okay so if we look at the journal it's

125
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,570
pulling images and that's why it's a lot

126
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,479
better to use a VM

127
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,999
because this VM has a good good download

128
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,550
the link or whereas here I would not be

129
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,389
able to do this imitation okay so it

130
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,360
looks like everything is running oh yeah

131
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,159
actually my chat so everything should be

132
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,680
running and if I leave a PS what the

133
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,939
adulthood is not real pretty but

134
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,379
everything is up so it's kind of

135
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:35,409
finished so I just want to check that

136
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,860
this IP got propagated in the meantime

137
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:54,969
so if I think yeah sorry okay so my app

138
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:56,800
is propagated and now I'm ready to

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,699
deploy applications so what do you want

140
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:07,870
for your association okay repair next

141
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,080
cloud so it should be as easy as little

142
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,580
provision so you specify a parameter

143
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,939
called you for URL and you put the URL

144
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,289
so let's say Cloud

145
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:25,449
Lib dot Sh you specify the application

146
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,439
so it's get comm slash in the hosters

147
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,198
will migrate to get clap soon that takes

148
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:39,130
time you know next cloud and I will

149
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,089
start it right away and there is one

150
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,949
more flag which is called by it's just

151
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,420
to buy the domain name if I didn't buy

152
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,000
it yet but yeah I already bought these

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,290
domain names I don't okay there are some

154
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,120
warnings but you know you can safely

155
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,370
ignore the warnings

156
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,960
now it's just that normally there is a

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,060
email back end and it provision an email

158
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,040
automatically for each instance so then

159
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,570
next cloud will be able to send emails

160
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,550
so this instance of next car would not

161
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,840
be able to send emails but that's fine

162
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,690
for the demonstration and so if I go to

163
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,800
data domains and to cloud the massage

164
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,560
and to leave a journal again it's just

165
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,480
pulling some docker images and here

166
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,720
actually we're a bit lucky because if

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,950
you see here this means that it's an

168
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,100
official docker hub image it's great

169
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,660
because it means like we don't have to

170
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,820
manage this package

171
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,930
well actually we did the docker image

172
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,000
for the exam but we don't really we are

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,900
many people maintaining it not only ok

174
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,980
so looks like things are working if I

175
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,680
leave a PS everything seems up I can

176
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,950
leave our logs to see what's happening

177
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:11,550
yeah it looks like nice and so we have

178
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,990
an exploding stance and with HTTP

179
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,770
certificate and now we need to chat also

180
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,170
right because chat is we don't

181
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,520
have matrix yet but so we can also

182
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,340
install chat that leave without Sh with

183
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,490
the application hosted on github comm

184
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:45,830
slash imposters slash read and

185
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:54,819
engi hosters okay some wanting to ignore

186
00:10:54,819 --> 00:11:16,369
and and if i go to the not yet so it's

187
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,160
putting image and set up rocket shot so

188
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,480
it's quite nice so i just wanted to show

189
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,279
that we have a github account and there

190
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,109
we have all the packages packages that

191
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:34,160
we provide with a sh and of course you

192
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,669
are

193
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,769
modern well welcome if you want to come

194
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,040
and help on this part and actually what

195
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
we want it's people using it and i was

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,779
really happy to receive my first pull

197
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,290
request some months ago to modify the

198
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,139
mail system to make it a bit better and

199
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:55,160
it's really because you start your code

200
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,629
and you don't know and somebody is using

201
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,600
it so it's amazing and yeah if you go

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,790
here it's our page and it's all our

203
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,040
projects and we can create new packages

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,179
and there is a bit of documentation and

205
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:18,730
okay that's it and maybe if we check yes

206
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:29,569
so we have a rocket chat instance right

207
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,369
so not just to conclude maybe you're

208
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:33,919
gonna talk a bit about the next steps so

209
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,169
as you see the infrastructure is working

210
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:36,619
pretty well

211
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,929
we are still improving it of course and

212
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,819
you can help us as you as you mentioned

213
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,829
and now the idea of the british is a so

214
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,929
the next step would be to to migrate to

215
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,199
communities at one point and also the

216
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,669
main step that we have to work on now is

217
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,309
the identity management because for now

218
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,100
it's we need we want single sign-on we

219
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,480
want like people to

220
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,100
manager users and stuff so that's reason

221
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,850
except for working on if people are have

222
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,820
skills in the LDAP you're looking for it

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,870
actually on maybe you're talking the

224
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,890
next cloud or something if you can

225
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,200
represent this so that's like or really

226
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,910
the next step and with that we could

227
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,680
have something similar in some ways and

228
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
like Google Apps for instance you could

229
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,010
just click on it and boom it's done like

230
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,140
that's really the step one to go to do

231
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,570
and of course in the others is just not

232
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,790
only the two of us like we really really

233
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,950
wish that people use this infrastructure

234
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,710
improve it work on it and that we all

235
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,720
work together to have mini in the

236
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,490
hosters or whatever you want to call it

237
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,440
what is like different shadows that are

238
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,510
using the same infrastructure than us so

239
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,760
if you don't branch to join you're

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
welcome if you want to use it you're

241
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,110
welcome if you want to if you have

242
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,550
questions also you're welcome to

243
00:13:53,340 --> 00:14:04,259
[Applause]

244
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,450
so the question is I have a free

245
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,790
software project and I want it to be

246
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,820
packaged by in the Auster's yes it's

247
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,180
possible we can help on that we actually

248
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,510
did it for some projects and so either

249
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,050
we have a user that wants it and pay for

250
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,390
the development of this image or maybe

251
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,220
you as a free software you have a bit of

252
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,470
funding and you help us by paying some

253
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,800
time to to help us to package it and so

254
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
it's usually how we do it because it's

255
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,500
difficult for us just to package it yes

256
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,390
it's there is a documentation if you

257
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,640
want exactly this is the thing you can

258
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,070
do it by yourself and you we can help

259
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,920
you on this and if you ask us to do it

260
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,589
like either we do it for free or not and

261
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,370
we can work around some solution and if

262
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,410
you go to yes on our repo slash

263
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:21,410
application so here you have a rough

264
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,600
documentation I would say but basically

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,860
it's like a docker compose that expose

266
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,020
service called web that expose the port

267
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,579
80 and this is the minimum Bible then

268
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,220
you can have a little install script and

269
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,420
it's recommended to have like a pre

270
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,029
backup script to dump to database and

271
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,200
then do we take care of the rest

272
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,690
yes

273
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,079
okay so we use convoys and so I don't

274
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,300
know if you bit familiar with them but

275
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,839
the tagline is securing the internet and

276
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,209
so they have all the plumbing and with

277
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,699
docker actually this is the the nice

278
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,879
part is that if we want to update a

279
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,589
server we basically do a coalesce update

280
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,089
they have mechanism and we lot not enter

281
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,660
the details and then actually whenever

282
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,050
there is a security issue we just go to

283
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:32,720
the so to update this chat I would do

284
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,720
like this and what's happening behind

285
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,600
the scene yeah that's fine

286
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
what's happening behind the scene is

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,999
that it's doing a good pool to to have

288
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,249
the latest version of the repo and then

289
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,589
the carport of the latest version of the

290
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,569
images and then we starting the service

291
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:01,610
so it's really easy to update and this

292
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,039
is on the paper then hopefully the

293
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,869
docker image handles well also do a date

294
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,390
but this is the the goal of the docker

295
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,760
images and so some are doing it well and

296
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,220
some not yet but yet yeah

297
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,839
okay so the question is how does it

298
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,609
compare to sandstorm

299
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,809
or why knowest let's say that sandstorm

300
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,309
and y NOS is an implementation of

301
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,779
shuttle and we are not on one and so we

302
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,269
have different ideas about what's nice

303
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,480
or not and for instance on Samsung it's

304
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,519
really nice but I don't really like the

305
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,279
API that is a standard Amish and I think

306
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,409
the web should be open and use standard

307
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,820
API ever plugins

308
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,580
why you know us it's nice but maybe not

309
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,710
yet made for big hosting and doesn't use

310
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,070
docker well like everybody is free like

311
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:05,210
and I prefer docker and that's it so to

312
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,879
do backups we have a little module

313
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:19,489
called backups and what it does it loops

314
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:23,720
through all the domains and for each

315
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,029
domain if there is a pre backup script

316
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,239
it runs it it it runs it and so usually

317
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,269
the pre backup is a dump database dump

318
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,700
so we plan to move this inside the

319
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,200
docker image of the database but this is

320
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,450
another topic so then there is no pre

321
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,669
backup script anymore

322
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,109
so we just do like little damp and then

323
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:55,279
zip not zip but use duplicity yes use

324
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,619
duplicity to push it to a distant server

325
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,590
through SSH and then on this server

326
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,649
there is actually a process that is

327
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:06,470
putting the backups the old backups as

328
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,669
read-only for this user so if either

329
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,369
server got compromised cannot rewrite

330
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,999
both sides and so there is a package for

331
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,840
that also

332
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:32,410
yes yes it's the question is if I can if

333
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:40,320
we can handle aliases and so actually so

334
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,300
yeah you probably need want a YES on the

335
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:55,050
cloud and yeah so actually yeah we use a

336
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,260
sysadmin

337
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,650
hugging called discovery registration so

338
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,140
it means that our micro services the

339
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,870
webserver registering themselves in the

340
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,120
song hall database and this is all they

341
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,210
do and to do it like this registering to

342
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,050
the database countries just starting a

343
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,309
name geniux

344
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,889
container with the unviable virtual host

345
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,290
and then on the other side there is h

346
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,990
epoxy that is listening to every new

347
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,790
containers created that have this

348
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,770
unviable and so

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,420
and that's it so then it could be at

350
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,730
last from the outside and it would get

351
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,490
an HTTP certificate also and it could be

352
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,890
what it would be wired by the load

353
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:12,100
balancer to the right what chance okay

354
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,520
so one of the bet we did was that docker

355
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,420
compose sorry sorry the question is how

356
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,190
big would be to move the infrastructure

357
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,420
to kubernetes and so we did a bet on

358
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,880
docker compose and we do hope that

359
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,429
somehow the docker cluster would be easy

360
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,660
to manage docker compose it's not true

361
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,370
it is is winning at the moment so it

362
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,530
means that we have to rewrite all over

363
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,900
the compose docker compose file the good

364
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,910
news is that the docker images are

365
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,360
already written and we can reuse them so

366
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,850
this is one part then there are two hard

367
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,770
parts in docker that are still difficult

368
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,900
at the clustering level and for

369
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,570
clustering for kubernetes is the same is

370
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,690
first the network and second the storage

371
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,370
okay so for the network ideally we would

372
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,290
like to have an IPSec network between

373
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,030
the nodes and currently docker swarm

374
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,530
provides this thing but we don't want

375
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,160
Lucas one flannel doesn't implement it

376
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,540
there are various pull requests but

377
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,870
never got me out there are some projects

378
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,210
around using tink with etcd back-end

379
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,710
this would be my guess

380
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,690
if I have to do it and flannel is done

381
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,880
to win but I asked the city of course

382
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,980
and they plan to have an IP second panel

383
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,410
so this is good news so the network

384
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,840
should be finished then the last bit is

385
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:45,250
storage and our bet is safe and on one

386
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,390
hand reddit is working on making safe

387
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,910
working well on to biology's so if you

388
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,130
go to safe slash stalker

389
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,170
there was a lot of recipes on how to run

390
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,590
it on communities and city of cows told

391
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,710
me also that there is a company that is

392
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,440
also doing a kind of operator force F so

393
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,940
[Music]

394
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,040
the world might be full of rainbows soon

395
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,069
[Laughter]

396
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:27,419
[Applause]
