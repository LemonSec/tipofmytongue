2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,430
I've good afternoon as bennett said my

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,889
name is Leonie Watson I work for a

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,540
company called the pass yellow group

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,240
known as TPG on less formal occasions

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,760
amongst other things I'm also co-chair

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,070
of the w3c working group that looks

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,650
after a bunch of specs including HTML

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,160
Dom serviceworker shadow Dom custom

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,599
elements and whole bunch of other bits

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,750
and pieces you've probably come across

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,110
my field though is accessibility and so

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,870
that I'd like to do today is to talk

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,840
some about accessibility but take for

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,809
projects that exist in the open space

16
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,000
that have a major impact on

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,129
accessibility to illustrate some of the

18
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,760
points that I'd like to make so what is

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,480
accessibility

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,339
well it's important to realize that it's

21
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,589
just one piece of a toolkit called

22
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,109
inclusive design burnable the guys just

23
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,670
now we're talking about usability that's

24
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,920
come up a few times already today

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,600
visibility is definitely part of

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,089
inclusive design ensure it's only the

27
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,920
skills you need design engineering

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,470
usability accessibility but come

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,930
together to make products interfaces

30
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,439
technologies that are enjoyable and

31
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,759
possible for people to use in different

32
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,640
situations and no matter what their kind

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,270
of abilities or environmental context so

34
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,500
the bit of accessibility I'm going to

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,479
talk about today is very much focused on

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,479
the engineering and a stack that comes

37
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,250
together to enable someone like me who

38
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,759
is blind to use the web which is to say

39
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,289
an assistive technology called a screen

40
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,750
reader the code that will write to

41
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,460
create interfaces that I want to be able

42
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,399
to use the browser that I choose to be

43
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,439
able to look at those things in and

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,189
lastly our API is accessibility API is

45
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,049
that hook all three of those things

46
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,130
together to make it all work mostly so

47
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,289
the first project is NVDA non-visual

48
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,439
desktop access it's project being

49
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,659
developed on github led by a couple of

50
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,020
guys who are themselves blind and they

51
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,899
have created this screen reader which is

52
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,460
of course freely available as it would

53
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,950
be as an open project a screen reader if

54
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,420
you're not familiar with it is a piece

55
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,910
of software that converts pretty much

56
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,810
everything you see

57
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,840
on screen into text and then spits that

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,270
text out either as synthetic speech or

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,270
as refreshable Braille what's really

60
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,610
remarkable about the NVDA project is

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,560
that until it came along about ten years

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
ago the average cost of a screen reader

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,519
for Windows user were somewhere in the

64
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,650
region of six seven eight hundred euros

65
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,470
or more seriously expensive pieces of

66
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,739
kit and NVDA came along and completely

67
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,440
changed that other screen readers have

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,849
now come along as integrated systems

69
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,650
both in Windows and Apple products but

70
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,810
this still is the only real open source

71
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,860
screen reader of any particular note now

72
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,970
this is where we get to the never work

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,190
with children and animals all screen

74
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,680
readers and technology I wanted to play

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,019
a screen reader demo which of course

76
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,700
requires some sound well don't have any

77
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,340
speakers so I've turned up my volume and

78
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,510
I'm going to hope that you can hear it

79
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,250
but listen up because it's gonna be

80
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:29,000
tricky so now that said very quietly was

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,940
as the highlighted headings showed up on

82
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,950
the screen the screen reader was reading

83
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,350
each of those headings screen lead is

84
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,910
very good at reading all kinds of

85
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,920
different pieces of content in this

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,109
particular case it was looking at the H

87
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,690
tags in the HTML and announcing the text

88
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,459
that was inside them these heading has

89
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,780
happened to be links as well because

90
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,579
it's a pretty standard blog format and

91
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,870
the screen reader he could hear it was

92
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,120
also announcing the fact that it was a

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,319
link another quick demo our screen

94
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,880
readers as well as navigating to kind of

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,799
different chunks and elements of HTML

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:22,039
can just actually read content so screen

97
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,960
readers are very versatile pretty much

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,430
if you can see it on-screen and it has a

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,229
reasonable degree of accessibility about

100
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,940
it a screen reader will be able to

101
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,910
identify it and

102
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,610
translate it to that synthetic speech

103
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,170
it's not the most beautiful sounding

104
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,570
speech some text-to-speech engines are

105
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,070
much more human-like they tend to be a

106
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,870
bit slower so if you're an impatient

107
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,820
user like me you tend to stick to one of

108
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,900
the voices that sounds a bit more

109
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,550
robotic because it's a bit quicker off

110
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,750
the mark the next project I want to tell

111
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,460
you about is HTML which probably doesn't

112
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,470
fall into the classic definition of an

113
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,750
open-source project it's developed by

114
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,020
the w3c but the CC has changed a lot in

115
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,490
recent years and it's actually now

116
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,770
possible for anyone who's interested in

117
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,230
willing to contribute to any w3c

118
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,900
specification refine the HTML spec on

119
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,550
github you can do all the things you

120
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,870
expect to be able to do with an open

121
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,520
project you can file issues you can

122
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,000
suggest new features you can even

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,010
contribute actual patches and PRS back

124
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,610
up to the core HTML spec the only

125
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,960
condition is is that if you're not a

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,570
member of the w3c in any capacity we'll

127
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,030
just ask you to please sign await your

128
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,550
patent rights to it something that's

129
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,120
very dear to all w3c projects is that we

130
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,590
ensure all the technologies are

131
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,780
available patent free royalty free for

132
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,920
anybody who wants to use them in

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,440
perpetuity but beyond that the malaria

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,940
will want help from lots of different

135
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,880
developers so hTML is important in the

136
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,490
accessibility stack because that's where

137
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,110
screen readers get a lot of the

138
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,790
information that you just heard being

139
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,320
spoken most HTML elements have implicit

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,770
roles so if you use something like a

141
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,170
link you'll find that the screen reader

142
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,120
can automatically identify it just from

143
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,720
using that anchor tag in the HTML if you

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,340
were to inspect the accessibility

145
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,170
information about the link you discover

146
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,810
it has a roll of link in this case it

147
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,280
has an accessible name which is the link

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,700
text it's a link off to my blog and if

149
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,930
you don't did a bit deeper you'd also

150
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,550
find that if you previously visited that

151
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,780
link it would have a visited State sorry

152
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,109
there we go

153
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,890
if we were to look at an image we'd also

154
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,410
find the same thing in this case we've

155
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,290
got an image bar with a source file and

156
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,330
it has an alt attribute on it that

157
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,120
describes what the image is again if we

158
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,350
delve into this in the accessor

159
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,480
since we've discovered it has a roll of

160
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,880
image it has an accessible name that's

161
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,710
how a screen reader can identify it and

162
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,540
in this case it comes from the alt

163
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,910
attribute so a screen reader would say

164
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,550
something like image bottle of chimú

165
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,730
cursed Aquila certainly similar happens

166
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,410
when you have interactive elements like

167
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,900
inputs as well in this case this

168
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,880
particular form field has got a role of

169
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,400
checkbox it gets its accessible name

170
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,440
this time from the mobile element that's

171
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,900
associated with the field but all this

172
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,150
says to the screen reader basically say

173
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,800
this is a checkbox tell the user that

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,070
and in this case read the label text as

175
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,870
the accessible name so the user knows

176
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,780
what the checkbox is all about and that

177
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,090
accessibility comes for free from the

178
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,290
HTML my next project is Firefox I'm

179
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,940
pretty sure this one too is going to be

180
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,730
known to all of you it's a browser of

181
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,470
course that's developed in the open but

182
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,840
overall the open source browser projects

183
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,240
this one probably does the most amount

184
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,580
of hard work for accessibility the

185
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,560
guides on the Firefox accessibility team

186
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,630
are absolutely brilliant marcozzi he and

187
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,340
David bolter in particular and all the

188
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,930
guys that work with them but all the

189
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,520
contributions that come in whether it's

190
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,890
issue filing or actual patches and fixes

191
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,410
really make a difference Firefox is a

192
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,840
terrific browser to use especially with

193
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,260
the NVDA screen reader so what does

194
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,940
screen our browsers do in terms of

195
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,600
accessibility

196
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,270
well they give you focus ability for

197
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,160
free if you're dealing with interactive

198
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,410
elements like links or buttons or form

199
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,420
fields the browser's will make sure that

200
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,250
if you're a keyboard user ie you don't

201
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,050
have a mouse then you can focus on those

202
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,670
things as developers and engineers we

203
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,870
don't need to do any of the hard work

204
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,220
because the browser's just going to do

205
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,770
that for us for free you also get

206
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,410
expected interactions if your key would

207
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,670
use when you focus on a link your

208
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,530
expectation is is that you can activate

209
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,700
it using the Enter key

210
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,309
if you find a button the expectation is

211
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,570
that you can hit it with the Enter key

212
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,419
or the spacebar the browser provides all

213
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,460
that for free for you so again coming

214
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,500
back to using HTML as it was intended

215
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,540
you get a whole bunch of stuff courtesy

216
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,870
of the browser doing the hard work so if

217
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,520
we look here we've just got a piece of

218
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,700
straightforward HTML code just a

219
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
checkbox there nothing particularly

220
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,510
remarkable about it at all

221
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,680
what happens in the browser is is that

222
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,120
it creates the dome you'll know about

223
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
that there's nothing particularly new

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,589
about that to any of us I'm sure but you

225
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,450
might not know is that the browser also

226
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,980
creates something called an

227
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,710
accessibility tree so as the document is

228
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,190
loaded into the browser the browser

229
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,690
simultaneously creates the dom and the

230
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,600
accessibility tree and there are both

231
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,860
hierarchical tree structures of the

232
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,630
document in question but the

233
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,670
accessibility tree just contains

234
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,620
accessibility information so all the

235
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,360
stuff we saw earlier about roles and

236
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,300
names and States that's information that

237
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,860
the browser makes available in the

238
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,200
accessibility tree and what happens is

239
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
that as the dom gets updated perhaps in

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,150
response to a script or user interaction

241
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,270
but triggers the accessibility tree to

242
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,640
get updated the accessibility tree or

243
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
the browser then fires a change event

244
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,960
and an assistive technology like NVDA

245
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,450
listens out for that and then it detects

246
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,580
the change event it goes out looking at

247
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,170
the accessibility tree to find out

248
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,180
what's changed and mix their information

249
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,710
available to the user

250
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,750
so a good example is a notification that

251
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,940
gets added to a page visually it's

252
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,740
really obvious a bit of contents just

253
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,570
appeared probably slap bang in the

254
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,880
middle of the page to me who can't see

255
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
that I may never know that that piece of

256
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,620
information has appeared on the page but

257
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,029
these cascade of changes in the

258
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,470
accessibility tree and the way the

259
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,480
screen reader can deal with them mean

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,950
it's possible for my screen reader to

261
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,510
tell me that that piece of content has

262
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,980
appeared so there are piece of the thing

263
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,120
I want to talk about is accessibility

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,970
applies and in particular one that is

265
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,339
very much in incubation at the moment it

266
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,470
isn't actually a thing yet but it's well

267
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,760
on its way and it's called the

268
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,390
accessibility object model we have a

269
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,610
whole bunch of accessibility API eyes at

270
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,380
the moment and they will available on

271
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,770
different platforms on Lix on windows on

272
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,050
all the Apple platforms and Android

273
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,560
and these api's are how screen readers

274
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,630
currently get it'll read information in

275
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,580
the accessibility tree they clearly the

276
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,250
accessibility tree using one or more of

277
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,860
these api's and these api is exist at

278
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,350
the platform level so if you have a

279
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,750
platform control like this checkbox in

280
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,220
Windows I know I'm sorry I probably

281
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,130
shouldn't have windows

282
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,050
conference like this so you can take me

283
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,000
out and shoot me later but if you have

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,340
this control here you'll find that like

285
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,170
the HTML we were looking at earlier it

286
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,520
has a role of checkbox it has an

287
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
accessible name and other bits of

288
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,510
information we're coming to expect we

289
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,700
can then recreate exactly the same thing

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,730
in HTML and the available information to

291
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,530
a screen reader using the same API is

292
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,050
absolutely identical so a checkbox is a

293
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,670
check box is a check box as far as a

294
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,750
screen reader user is concerned

295
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,830
none of these are relationships if

296
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,900
you're curious between the the platform

297
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,400
level controls and the ones that appear

298
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,770
in HTML are available in another w3c

299
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,510
document so if you're curious to know

300
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,100
what all the roles and mappings are for

301
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,350
different HTML elements that's the place

302
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,800
to go but there's a catch the problem at

303
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,390
the moment is that none of those api's

304
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,100
can be used by us engineers and

305
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,860
developers they are really exclusively

306
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,220
for use by screen readers why I like the

307
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,020
idea of the a oh and the accessibility

308
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,730
object model is that it's a JavaScript

309
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,060
API and it's setting itself out to do

310
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,740
some really interesting things it's

311
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,930
going to give us as developers access to

312
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,940
the accessibility tree in the browser's

313
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,340
so we like screen readers and other

314
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,810
assistive technologies we'll be able to

315
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,060
query that accessibility tree and find

316
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,250
out what accessibility information is

317
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,550
available about existing nodes more than

318
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,780
that we're actually going to be able to

319
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,310
create virtual nodes in the

320
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,200
accessibility tree so if there is

321
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,820
something in the Dom that in itself

322
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,220
isn't particularly accessible we can

323
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,050
make it more accessible using scripting

324
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,730
by updating the information that's

325
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,740
available about that same thing in the

326
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,660
accessibility tree so it's going to be

327
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,390
an extremely powerful next stage if you

328
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,810
like in terms of accessibility so let's

329
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,240
really your open accessibility stack you

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,620
need a screen reader an assistive

331
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,210
technology if you're someone like me to

332
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,250
be able to get to the web page or the

333
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,750
browser ins you know whatever it may be

334
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,530
in self we need people using good

335
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,880
technologies like HTML but have a lot of

336
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,050
built-in accessibility you can fix

337
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,370
accessibility to choose not to use HTML

338
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,110
in its native sense but it's harder work

339
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,820
for us and harder work accessibility

340
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,520
wise to use good browsers like Firefox

341
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,110
they really do champion accessibility

342
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,580
and support a great deal of many

343
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,250
features and lastly keep an eye on

344
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,540
something like the a OMB

345
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,980
it's really gonna be a game-changer

346
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,810
particularly in the way we code complex

347
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,910
web applications and interfaces over the

348
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,970
next few years and that's me done thank

349
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:42,720
you very much I have no idea if I have

350
00:13:42,720 --> 00:14:13,710
time for questions somebody you mean

351
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,210
between NVDA and the ones that you have

352
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,750
to pay for or actually no very little

353
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,730
difference at all which is the other

354
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,910
remarkable thing about NVDA and so you

355
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,760
compare our two guys plus you know open

356
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
community working with them of perhaps

357
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,070
20 regular contributors to some of the

358
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,570
companies that make the proprietary

359
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,660
screen readers Microsoft Apple Freedom

360
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,070
Scientific who you know have got all

361
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,360
this income coming in and actually

362
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,790
future for future there is nothing I'd

363
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,440
really care to call in terms of the

364
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,270
difference between NVDA and any of them

365
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,170
yes there is a slack channel rules le

366
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,290
eleven wire slackers if you're not

367
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,300
familiar with it a 11y is a bit like I

368
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,640
18 and 11 is the number of letters

369
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,670
between a and Y of accessibility and

370
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,320
there you'll find two or three hundred

371
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,390
people who some people whom have

372
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,110
disabilities like myself but all of whom

373
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,760
work in accessibility or have some

374
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,290
interest in accessibility so that's a

375
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,360
really good place to ask questions and

376
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,970
get technical solutions and have people

377
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,530
you know test things out if they've got

378
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,350
a spare a few minutes if you are looking

379
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,720
for more of a mailing list option the

380
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,910
w3c has a w AI /ig which is just an

381
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,010
email forum that has about 2,000 people

382
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,770
on it of all different backgrounds from

383
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,620
academia through engineering to people

384
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,460
with disabilities multinational as well

385
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,140
the other email based forum that's a

386
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,400
very good place to get help and ask

387
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,190
questions is called web aim w/e be a IM

388
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,920
and that's another free email forum

389
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,329
that's a good place to go

390
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,889
[Music]

391
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,249
right yeah so most browsers on most

392
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:03,749
platforms now have tools that you can

393
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,369
use to inspect the accessibility tree

394
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,789
Chrome Firefox some of the unmentionable

395
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,299
windows ones too but yes you can get

396
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,439
into that so those are tools that you

397
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,000
can use to look at the accessibility

398
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,138
tree and compare it to the Dom I'm not

399
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,220
sure if this is also what you mentioned

400
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,138
but Chrome as a browser also has an

401
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,630
extension called chrome rocks which is

402
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,880
another type of screen reader it's

403
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,959
actually they've actually just released

404
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,490
an update just saw some tweets going

405
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,380
past this morning that makes it very

406
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,059
much more capable than it used to be

407
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,190
which is terrific the only problem is

408
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,110
because it only works in the browser you

409
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,730
don't find many blind people use it

410
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,889
because we still need a screen reader to

411
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:42,899
turn on the computer open the browser

412
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,779
get to the web page so having just a

413
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,250
screen reader then it's just only in the

414
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,169
browser it is only a kind of tiny part

415
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,940
of what we need to cover in terms of

416
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,990
having that kind of availability

417
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,210
absolutely so on linux as you said

418
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,470
you've got you've got okay you've got

419
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,059
chrome rocks if you just want to test it

420
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,690
in the browser windows has a screen

421
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,490
reader called narrator built-in you can

422
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,340
just turn on control windows enter to

423
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,630
toggle it on and off

424
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,789
iOS devices if you use those you can

425
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,289
just triple click the home buttons on

426
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,610
any of them to turn the screen reader

427
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,429
they're on or off on a market it used to

428
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:31,049
be command f5 until they did that thing

429
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,309
with the toolbar recently and I haven't

430
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,480
quite sure what it is now I'm sorry and

431
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,470
Android as well there's a screen reader

432
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,380
called talkback that you can you can

433
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,000
enable and turn on so pretty much

434
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,529
whichever your chosen kind of platform

435
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,419
for development is or whatever you're

436
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,950
asked to develop on in your work

437
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,779
environments you should be able to find

438
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,399
a free screen reader that you can turn

439
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,260
on and probably get really lost using

440
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,900
it's very important you're right

441
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,890
thank you so much thanks very much

442
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:07,719
