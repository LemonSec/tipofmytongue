1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,530
okay your neck

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,580
speakers are dead aunt Molly talking

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:18,410
about how to build a movement things are

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,160
coming

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,940
this is Molly de Blanc this is Deb

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,230
Nicholson that's okay go in it could be

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,090
someone else's problem we're going to

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,010
talk about how to build an all-ages free

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,160
software movement if you want to tweet

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,739
about that topic you can use this

11
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,570
hashtag or you can use it on other

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,940
social media whatever you like

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,860
I'm bacon and coconut and this is Molly

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:52,399
millions and millions and great we

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,030
believe that in order to build a strong

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,649
successful ongoing movement that can

17
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,629
really create change especially on a

18
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:00,379
global scale

19
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,750
you need to have diverse and inclusive

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,759
communities where you have a wide

21
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:06,770
variety of experiences and specialized

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,650
knowledge age is one of the particular

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,270
issues in which we aren't necessarily

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,380
great at so what we're gonna cover is

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,790
we're gonna go a little bit deeper on

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,890
why we care and then we're gonna look

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,020
specifically at what's going on with age

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,180
in our communities and then we're gonna

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,130
talk about some solutions we like some

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,500
that already exist and some that perhaps

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,570
we'll be able to inspire folks here to

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,680
help us create so going on to why we

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,119
care movements that are successful or

34
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,460
persistent and they last for a long time

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,409
and that means that you have to be able

36
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,990
to pass the torch from one generation to

37
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,170
the next without losing kind of what

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,659
really makes the movement special and

39
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,360
motivating and you know it can't just

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
kind of degrade into this thing we show

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,549
up for and so that means not just

42
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,960
communicating how we do it but why we do

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,850
it so we're focused on talking about

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,008
movements right now free software tools

45
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,450
are great I use a whole bunch of them

46
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,159
Deb uses a whole bunch of them I hope

47
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,779
all of you also use a whole bunch of

48
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,840
them but right now we want to talk

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
about how to push a movement forward

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,580
right so free software is a philosophy

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,470
and there's a wonderful developmental

52
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,720
model that is enabled by this philosophy

53
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,670
when you're building a movement you're

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,709
really looking at a long term plan and

55
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,810
so sometimes you'll do things that don't

56
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,330
have short-term payoffs and that's what

57
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,970
we're really talking about now and in

58
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,299
fact the tools and the movement feed off

59
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,400
of each other like yeast and maybe they

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,420
create exciting things like beer but the

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,940
the things like shared decision-making

62
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,430
and transparency and consensus building

63
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,180
are often what that sort of mutual

64
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,370
feeding can look like and they tend to

65
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,590
produce exciting successful fast

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,680
projects when they're done Wow and then

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,340
that's it communities have to focus on

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,349
people so these folks I assume they're

69
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,000
having a lot of fun even though they

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,829
look half dead right

71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,180
and so communities need to sort of focus

72
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,650
on individuals and making sure that

73
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,690
everyone's having a good time or people

74
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,370
will stop showing up no matter what

75
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,500
their age is so this is going to be very

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
much for communities some of it may be

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
helpful to you and your company but

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,980
we're really talking about the

79
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,609
communities which are people we also are

80
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,380
aware and think everyone needs to be

81
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,400
aware of the difference between

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,859
diversity and inclusivity these days

83
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,690
people are putting them together a lot

84
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,510
more diversity one way to think about it

85
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,819
is the picture on your textbook or in

86
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,829
the advertisement where it's like oh

87
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,079
there's the blonde girl and there's the

88
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,720
black kid and there's the Asian guy and

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,609
instead of space where people feel

90
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,019
welcome and feel like they're can

91
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,260
contribute and be part of a community

92
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,810
right so more than just optics this is a

93
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,630
whole study on how diversity makes

94
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,829
groups smarter and what this researcher

95
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,070
found was that when people are preparing

96
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,380
an argument that they perceive for

97
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,399
someone they perceived to be as

98
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,349
different from them they actually

99
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,780
prepare a better more thorough argument

100
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,880
they're like I did more of my homework I

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,610
did more of the work too

102
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,449
my point and this happens in politics it

103
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,229
happens a long different lines like when

104
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,479
someone is presenting something to a

105
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,069
different gender or a different race or

106
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,830
a different political party they tend to

107
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,840
present stronger more well-thought-out

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,509
ideas which I think makes our movements

109
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,699
stronger and this one is also about

110
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,740
diversity but this is about not just

111
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,689
sort of like you were talking about the

112
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,150
picture or like sort of the sprinkling

113
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,580
of diversity or the diversity on your

114
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,659
pamphlet only but diverse headcount is

115
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:07,030
useless without inclusivity so people

116
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,389
need to want to stick around if you've

117
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,819
got one person who's like your token

118
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,639
woman they're not going to be very happy

119
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,120
being your token for very long so our

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,870
challenge is to not just go to the

121
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,800
letter of like your organization's

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,689
diversity statement but to really kind

123
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,080
of arms wide open and not not this is a

124
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
metaphor don't physically touch people

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
when they get to your community but

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,990
until you know them until you know them

127
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,419
but it means asking them questions and

128
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,129
then listening to the answers about how

129
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,659
they're doing in your community

130
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,759
it means incorporating their ideas

131
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,529
making sure they're at the meetings

132
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,879
where important decisions are made

133
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,789
making sure they have access to the

134
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,409
information about like what is

135
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,180
successful and what's not successful

136
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,029
about your project another way to think

137
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,669
about this is as shared power so if

138
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,770
there's an invisible barrier between

139
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,469
like entry level you get to be in our

140
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,169
yearly photo and oh the board which

141
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,360
drives all of our actual decisions over

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,419
here you're not going to have people

143
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,389
keep coming to your project to just be

144
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,879
part of your yearly photo so you really

145
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,000
need to share power if you want people

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,520
from groups that you haven't had in your

147
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,629
project before to stick around so who is

148
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:34,120
a minority in tech you're all of these

149
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,539
people this photo was from women of

150
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,200
color and texture they did

151
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,490
session where they took a bunch of stock

152
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,110
photos that wonderful people like you

153
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,120
can now use when you need stock photos

154
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,180
[Applause]

155
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,350
though this is another person who's of

156
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,240
mine already a tech I love this photo

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,240
cuz it's like classic hacker computer

158
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,820
screen darkroom she's up to no good look

159
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,930
at that face oh yeah she's definitely

160
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,940
ddossing something I'm sure she might be

161
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,720
right

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,780
so to be more specific about some groups

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,420
that are minorities in tech now we did

164
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,930
our best to try to use terminology here

165
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,820
that seemed like the right terminology

166
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,390
to us if you know better words we should

167
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,460
be using please talk to us afterwards or

168
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,610
you could tweet at us so that we can do

169
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,560
better in the future

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,090
so there's there are minorities of

171
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,520
gender and that usually just kind of

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
means anyone who is in a man race and

173
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,620
ethnicity you're dealing with people of

174
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,380
color first introduced or native people

175
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,370
people who identify as latina or Latino

176
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,830
and background is also there as well so

177
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,270
there are people with disabilities

178
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,490
people who are blind if you have a

179
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,260
particular problem with your project so

180
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,210
it doesn't meet typical accessibility

181
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,100
standards some might not some one might

182
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,660
not be able to contribute but they also

183
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,350
might just not be able to use it non

184
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,900
college graduates kind of a side note on

185
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,150
that is it's it's still easier to get

186
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,460
involved in tech if you're a man

187
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,390
regardless of whether or not you have a

188
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,310
degree and it's a lot harder for women

189
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,130
and other minorities to get involved

190
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,200
when they don't have degrees people

191
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,940
outside of technical education and

192
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,340
skills like you didn't study computer

193
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,900
science you didn't study mathematics you

194
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,370
don't have a background in that but then

195
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,100
you decide it's a thing you want to do

196
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,330
working-class people so people who

197
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,010
aren't from middle class backgrounds or

198
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,860
aren't currently middle class and people

199
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,470
over the age of 35 and soon we will talk

200
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,120
about my 35 is a significant number

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,659
great

202
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,570
so for intersectionality the same kinds

203
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,840
of institutional mindsets policies and

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,050
social norms affect people across

205
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,500
different demographic groups so the same

206
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,510
kinds of things that could lead people

207
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,150
to make women uncomfortable are similar

208
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,370
and related to or the same as the kind

209
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,540
of things that could make someone who's

210
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,200
older uncomfortable like a grumpy

211
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,960
mailing list great so oppressive

212
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,260
institutions are interconnected but we

213
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,970
haven't really addressed age yet which

214
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,730
is why we're gonna talk about that well

215
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,580
there's more and now we have people of

216
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,440
all ages working in free and open source

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,030
software so it's a great time to start

218
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,600
talking about this so what's going on

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,990
with age this is a really interesting

220
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,050
problem because it's highly enforced by

221
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,020
popular culture and it's reflected in a

222
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,740
lot of companies ideas about culture fit

223
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,730
and we'll go into that this is a quote

224
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,830
from Mark Zuckerberg yeah Mark

225
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,290
Zuckerberg so we're from Massachusetts

226
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,660
in the state of Massachusetts what

227
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,270
Massachusetts no no okay

228
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,220
we live in the state of Massachusetts

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,480
the Department of Labor and

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,180
Massachusetts defines anyone in the

231
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,250
workforce over the age of 40 as an

232
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,610
advanced worker keep that in mind if

233
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,440
you're over 40 you're totally great

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,550
regardless that's what they told me so

235
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,530
Mark Zuckerberg is this guy he made a

236
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,450
website or something I hear some people

237
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,470
use it he said I want to stress the

238
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
importance of being young and technical

239
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,050
young people are just smarter why are

240
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,600
most chess masters under 30 he said this

241
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,870
when he was like 22 or 23 so you're

242
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,740
seeing this view of younger people and

243
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,470
older people in technology from someone

244
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,400
who's younger as well and then this is

245
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,720
from Vinod Khosla a people under 35 are

246
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,250
the people who make change happen and

247
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,530
older entrepreneurs fail to innovate

248
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,060
because they're falling back on old

249
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,590
habits he was 56 when he said this so

250
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,130
Tech has an age problem we're on this

251
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,470
the H problem doesn't is not limited to

252
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,750
individuals talking to one another it

253
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,140
really is an institutional issue in 2011

254
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,360
Brian Reid he was a Google employee he

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,030
was let go of her fired from his job he

256
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,890
sued Google as an age discrimination

257
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,410
suit there'd been a lot of conversations

258
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,350
on his team about his age and how he was

259
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,540
boring and he was old and his ideas

260
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,470
weren't any good and this created a

261
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,270
space where he didn't feel like he could

262
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,280
participate in the team but it was also

263
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,360
very clear that people weren't

264
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,110
respecting him for his experience 20

265
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,250
2013 Facebook also had a similar thing

266
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,470
but it was related to a job listing a

267
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,600
number of job listings really like to

268
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,300
focus entry-level job listings like to

269
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,060
focus on the concept of new grads rather

270
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,180
than people who are just starting in the

271
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,230
field here are some specific details I

272
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,150
found out about age median age of

273
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,490
employees Facebook comes in pretty young

274
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,870
for large tech companies at 26 and HP

275
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,190
comes in at 39 which is the oldest now

276
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,990
none of these people are advanced

277
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,250
workers according to the state of

278
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,160
Massachusetts I'm going to check my

279
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,810
notes to make sure I get the next set of

280
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,730
Statistics right because there are some

281
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,550
more remember

282
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,630
incidentally and this is this is from

283
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,130
like job rating websites HP lists or

284
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,110
it's consider that the average number of

285
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,300
hours of HP employee works during a

286
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,390
single day is 7.5 this is in comparison

287
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,370
to Facebook where people are citing

288
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,750
their averages between 9 and 10 so the

289
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,640
way we treat older people are older and

290
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,290
younger people in our communities often

291
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,810
based on assumptions and of course those

292
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,580
assumptions are pretty different for the

293
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,530
two groups and we're gonna look at young

294
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,820
people first young people is a pretty

295
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,860
wide breadth here we're using that to

296
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,990
refer to people who are not yet in

297
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,730
college or who are in college

298
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,780
and you know or for lack of a better

299
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,500
term are not yet of a working age and so

300
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,880
these are people that we want to have

301
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,300
drink the free-software kool-aid right

302
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,490
and we want to we're going to talk about

303
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,710
both pre college and then also college

304
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,180
student age so as Molly pointed out

305
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,220
Facebook has people working at nine or

306
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,800
ten hours a day which of course like

307
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,050
then it kind of like reveals what they

308
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,910
might like about younger workers as

309
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,430
opposed to older workers not necessarily

310
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,220
their sparkly ideas but their interest

311
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,530
or willingness to work for 10 hours a

312
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,380
day and so those say things like class

313
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,900
of 2015 or 2016 preferred and they get

314
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,730
they try and convince folks like you can

315
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,410
treat the office like your home it can

316
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,180
be like your living room will do your

317
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,390
laundry for you you know encouraging

318
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,430
people to eat at the office like there

319
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,790
are companies that if you if you come in

320
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,040
for breakfast and stay till dinner and

321
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,110
then two more hours you get a free ride

322
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,770
home in an uber and so you know they

323
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,630
really have this go to a science where

324
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,100
they get you to come in and do 10 hours

325
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,950
a day for as long as possible another

326
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,570
thing that I think may be happening is

327
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,950
that younger people don't have the

328
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,530
experience to negotiate work terms and

329
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,410
that includes things like who owns their

330
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,450
software what kinds of licenses they're

331
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,100
willing to have their code put under and

332
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,830
of course like workplace conditions and

333
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,020
hours and things like that how many of

334
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,000
you got involved with free or

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,320
open-source software before you are 24

336
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,550
Wow I hollered ain't cool okay now I

337
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,100
want it so who here is currently in some

338
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,470
capacity contributing to a project this

339
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,060
can mean you're using it but it could

340
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,830
also mean you're walking around telling

341
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,450
people how great it is you're trying to

342
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,090
get everybody using Libre Office you're

343
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,220
writing code you're going to conferences

344
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,420
you're running conferences awesome so

345
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,800
keep your hands up I like having the

346
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,940
hands up thing it's like you're

347
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,769
participating

348
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,470
great now how many of you are involved

349
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,720
in those specific projects before you

350
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,629
are 24 okay how many of you while you're

351
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,059
still in college okay how many of you

352
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,959
are actually Wesley Crusher next slide

353
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,049
yeah there's Wesley Crusher cool in a

354
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,179
lot of projects similar to how you might

355
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,089
see tok like other tokenism there's also

356
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,790
frequently like the token kid who's this

357
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,670
guy who's like super smart and super

358
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,040
bright and super sharp and he's involved

359
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,720
and he's everywhere and everybody's

360
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,119
really excited to help him and be

361
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:01,569
involved with him but that's only one

362
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,709
person and that doesn't mean you're

363
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,179
actually creating a space for other

364
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,649
people especially if there are other

365
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,239
people who aren't already coming at

366
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,860
something as someone who feels empowered

367
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,420
to participate and to make space for

368
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,899
themselves the Gryffindor Quidditch team

369
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,040
is a really good example of this

370
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,889
actually because you have Harry Potter I

371
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,509
love Harry Potter but she picked this

372
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,290
slide by the way this was not me so in

373
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,639
the Gryffindor Quidditch team you have

374
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,220
Harry Potter who's just like the best at

375
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,379
this random wizard sport and he doesn't

376
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,360
need any training he just like shows up

377
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,309
and he's brilliant from day one the

378
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,709
thing is generally younger people need

379
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,990
more training and then when you're

380
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,040
looking at people who are already

381
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,929
graduates people who've been involved in

382
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,009
things for a while people who have

383
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,290
different kinds of backgrounds so you

384
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,639
need to be there and you need to be

385
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,980
ready to work with people to get them up

386
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,939
to speed next slide one of the ways you

387
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,519
do this is mentorship having a mentor is

388
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,259
really great you know you need things

389
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,360
you need handles you need identities you

390
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,649
need people to tell you when you're

391
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,249
being universally stupid okay some of

392
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,049
you are hackers hackers fans at least I

393
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:05,888
hear a few laughs

394
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,709
um so that's where mentors come in and

395
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,609
there are people who are already

396
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,470
experienced and these can be peer

397
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,119
mentors so they can be people your age

398
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,279
peer mentorship is really great it's

399
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,959
super useful it's one of the best ways

400
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
to get people to get people

401
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,579
understanding things and interested in

402
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,770
them especially younger people but it's

403
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,329
also just wonderful to have somebody

404
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,740
who's looking out for you and helping

405
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,340
you develop a kind of one particular

406
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,919
example of this is the tools a lot of

407
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,590
free software projects use

408
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,909
our older tools I think I RSSI and in

409
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,400
general I RAC L yeah another is a high

410
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,770
our SSI user over there similar Qaddafi

411
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,429
to high five yeah I a lot of like people

412
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,029
are now switching to slack or HipChat

413
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,440
but IRC is still there and you know

414
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,299
people keep telling me it's hard to use

415
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,120
I'm not convinced it is you know it took

416
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
me a few tries to figure it out but I'm

417
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,779
pretty sure I can generally do it now as

418
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,799
long as they don't actually close the

419
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,010
screen so now we're going to talk about

420
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,789
older people culture impacts what we

421
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,620
think and what kinds of assumptions we

422
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,380
make so I spend a lot of time last year

423
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,270
looking at when when and if actually I

424
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,610
could find depictions of older women in

425
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,010
tech and I was gonna start looking for

426
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,750
women over 50 and then when I started

427
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,700
looking I realized like oh I have to go

428
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,919
lower I if I want to look at like

429
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,409
fictional technical women I assess see

430
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,350
if I can find any over 40 and I was only

431
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,169
able to find for like could all of the

432
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,539
TIA like I asked people all over the

433
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,669
internet if they could think of anyone -

434
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,620
were ones that aged up with their

435
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,149
franchise so we had send me at the

436
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,830
Carter from Stargate and lieutenant

437
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,110
Uhura from Star Trek and then the other

438
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,010
two were newer shows but women in a

439
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,190
technical / management role not like you

440
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,070
know coding at night and guzzling you

441
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,380
know redbull or whatever but managing

442
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,110
people there's there's also failed to

443
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,730
mention this there's the nurse in Star

444
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,590
Trek TOS I don't remember her name which

445
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,330
shows you how important she was but

446
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,039
later in the movie she becomes a doctor

447
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,730
I just heard a lot of people you like

448
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,200
someone to tweet that at us and we'll

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,320
add it for next time so the two that I

450
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,120
found in the technical management role

451
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
is Nina sharp from the fringe so if

452
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,549
people watched that and then and I

453
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,740
watched this you don't have to Avery

454
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,630
Ryan which is Patricia Arquette's

455
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,049
character and CSI cyber so those are the

456
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,049
only two other examples I could find of

457
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,640
women in tech I think see you sighs

458
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,220
divers still on I've tried to erase it

459
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,350
from all my industry so I don't hear

460
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,659
about it but I really appreciate you

461
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,879
doing that for me yeah

462
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:51,479
and I was like nope that's my husband so

463
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,019
so a lot of this is very you know so

464
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,299
it's kind of not it's it's not

465
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,190
surprising that people can't picture

466
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,269
older women in a technical role and in

467
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,919
fact we find this to be the case so I

468
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,729
didn't a number of interviews with women

469
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:12,449
over 40 who worked in tech and this is a

470
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,909
quote from a 57 year old woman and she

471
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,319
said that it was really hard for her to

472
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,149
you know get interviews and new jobs so

473
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:23,069
like this is during a time when Silicon

474
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,419
Valley is poaching each other's

475
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,029
employees they're working really hard to

476
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,469
make sure everyone knows like our

477
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:31,349
workplace is the funnest like we're

478
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,959
doing the cutting edges software like

479
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,239
you know recruiters are aggressive like

480
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,209
I have I have like gnu/linux in my

481
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:41,129
LinkedIn and I get stuff and I'm not a

482
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,469
sysadmin they don't know I'm over 40 I

483
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,169
guess but every single company in

484
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,599
Silicon Valley manages to just manage to

485
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,819
not hire older women in technology so a

486
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,129
lot of the older women that you guys

487
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,659
know this guy I love this one a lot of

488
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,609
the older women that I talked to they

489
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,869
said you know I did this for a number

490
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,059
years and I'm done I'm gonna go do

491
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,919
something else not because they want to

492
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,049
have babies not because like you know

493
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,269
the technology you've changed so fast

494
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:14,039
that they couldn't keep up but because

495
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,690
they were just like I'm too old for this

496
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,079


497
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,719
and they went and they go find another

498
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,339
career some amounts to do where they

499
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:22,469
don't have to put up with the like you

500
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:25,169
know weird misconceptions and the you

501
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,649
know failure to be taken seriously so

502
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:32,190
and this finally for the women who do

503
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,289
stay some of them end up kind of getting

504
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:37,739
pushed towards management and so this

505
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,690
woman said you know she used to really

506
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,999
like working on technical hard problems

507
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,369
but over and over again she's been

508
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,249
pushed to train young people so she get

509
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,289
to the place where she felt like her

510
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,599
only purpose there was to mentor young

511
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,879
people and have them realize their

512
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,309
exciting ideas and you could like hang

513
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:57,779
around and teach them how to do the

514
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:59,669
tools and all that kind of stuff and

515
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:00,920
she's like I didn't want

516
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,990
be a manager but like because I'm a

517
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,820
woman they really wanted me to den

518
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,970
mother than you coders we're gonna talk

519
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,890
about volunteering now free software is

520
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,500
powered by volunteers there are more

521
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,140
companies who are producing free

522
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,850
software as and people have convinced

523
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,110
them that or they've convinced

524
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,670
themselves that what they're working on

525
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,410
should be released under a wonderful

526
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,910
excellent free software license like all

527
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,150
of your companies should be doing but a

528
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,850
lot of it is still people who are just

529
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,440
interested in projects and who want to

530
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,960
get involved great

531
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,840
volunteering is super wonderful it's one

532
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,970
of the places where you can really

533
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,300
create communities that are multi that

534
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,150
are multi-generational really diverse

535
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,430
really inclusive because people are

536
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,020
showing up for them because they want to

537
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,430
be there they're people who want to help

538
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,660
out they're people who want to be

539
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,100
involved and they're people who are

540
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,880
really invested in what's going on here

541
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,230
are some statistics I really like

542
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,150
statistics and demographics if you can't

543
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,100
tell yet here are some stuff on

544
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,690
volunteering when you're looking at

545
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,660
younger people between the ages of 12

546
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,780
and 18 you're getting about 55% of them

547
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,160
volunteering they're coming in with

548
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,520
about 29 hours per year most of these

549
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,650
are in youth organizations so things

550
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,820
that are specifically geared towards

551
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,830
younger people and also religious

552
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,180
organizations as well get to that in a

553
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,100
second

554
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,360
one of the reasons for this in that

555
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,490
particular age group is that you're

556
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,260
looking at people who want to go to

557
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,910
college and while it can be laudable

558
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,530
while it can be great while it can be

559
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,210
wonderful that you care so much about

560
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,790
something to put in 250 hours of

561
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,760
volunteer time while you're at universe

562
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,410
Oh while you're at high school that's

563
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,240
actually not that impressive according

564
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,120
to an admissions officer at some fancy

565
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,280
school in Cambridge when you're looking

566
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,490
at retirees you are getting fewer people

567
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,890
total as in rather than 55 percent

568
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,130
they're coming in at 42% what's really

569
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,200
great about this though and why this is

570
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,150
impressive is these are people who

571
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,920
aren't doing it because they want to go

572
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,720
to college they're doing it because they

573
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,370
just want to do something and they want

574
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:13,540
to

575
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,330
that's they're coming in at 96 hours per

576
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,560
year which is really great

577
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,060
again there's there's a lot of

578
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,220
volunteering and religious organizations

579
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,500
across the board actually religious

580
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,390
organizations have the most volunteers

581
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,280
there are a lot of reasons for this

582
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,750
historically they've built community is

583
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,300
also at least in the United States

584
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,490
because religious organizations are all

585
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,860
nonprofits anything you do for one

586
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,010
happens to be volunteering there's

587
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,510
another metric when we're talking about

588
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,550
volunteers which is how many people are

589
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,040
hitting over 500 hours a year in

590
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,270
volunteer time so 10% of elderly

591
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,280
volunteers accrue that many and this is

592
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,440
the largest percentage of people in this

593
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,620
like wonderful 500 plus hours per year

594
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,850
category and here are some organizations

595
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,690
that are multi-generational so one Molly

596
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,090
and I want here within bison is girls

597
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,130
rock camp and this is it's a

598
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,760
organization run by women for young

599
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,460
women to help them find a place feel out

600
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,670
would be proud and play an instrument

601
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,490
and so the there's there's roles for

602
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,190
women of all ages to do mentoring and

603
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,440
then the a lot of the a lot of the kids

604
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,420
who go through the camp end up being

605
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,490
camp counselors when they're 16 17 18

606
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,830
years old and so they've built this like

607
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,050
you know kind of like every single age

608
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,270
group is represented in there another

609
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,690
place that we see a lot of

610
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,800
intergenerational volunteering as

611
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,560
political campaigns and political

612
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,690
campaigns are like show up we will find

613
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,880
something for you to do I used to work

614
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,620
primarily in local politics in

615
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,680
Massachusetts and you know older people

616
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,600
would show up and stuff envelopes people

617
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,460
would bring their kids in like all

618
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,460
different ages and and it was really it

619
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,110
felt like you know there was a real

620
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,580
torch being passed a lot of amazing

621
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,410
stories over the envelope stuffing table

622
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,790
kind of as a quick pitch for that if you

623
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,650
happen to live near one of the many

624
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,890
excellent free software and great tech

625
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,320
for good humanity organizations you

626
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,850
consider volunteering at them they

627
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,730
always need people to stuff envelopes

628
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,570
going back to religious organizations

629
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,460
you see people like the quake

630
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,870
they have like the Friends Service

631
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,520
Committee these are people who go all

632
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,840
over the world some of them are

633
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,700
volunteers some of them are employees

634
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,820
and they're bringing you know these

635
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,370
these wonderful things to other places

636
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,500
you also see see this with Unitarian

637
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,320
Universalists Habitat for Humanity is

638
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
another really great example of this

639
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,520
because it's an organization that values

640
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,549
like young people who can run around and

641
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,429
swing hammers just as much as they value

642
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,169
older people who are retired

643
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:58,600
electricians who like can totally just

644
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,539
kill like wiring a house so volunteering

645
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,610
is great younger people and older people

646
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,429
like to use their time to do it no

647
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,760
there's also I think well what the point

648
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,130
of this section is that we could have

649
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,950
more volunteers if we were able to be

650
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,450
more welcoming to different age groups

651
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,820
and and I think it's it's integral to

652
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,320
the success of the free software

653
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,260
movement to have an unbroken chain of

654
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,230
people coming in so we're gonna talk

655
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,010
about some of the solutions we like we

656
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,169
would like to see a movement where older

657
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,850
people with experience can pass the

658
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,250
torch to the younger generations while

659
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,809
empowering them to actually make the

660
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,370
movement their own it's I want people to

661
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,380
be able to ask each other for advice and

662
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,980
for folks you know we don't need to put

663
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,720
a small handful of older people on a

664
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,740
pedestal and looking to them for advice

665
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,120
are all kinds of different things that

666
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,820
they might not even be expert in I'd

667
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,200
like to see a situation where young

668
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,399
people and old people can put their

669
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,370
ideas out there and there the idea is

670
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,200
judged on its merits not by the age of

671
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,570
the person who floated the idea so

672
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,980
that's kind of the the vision there so

673
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,990
there is some great stuff happening to

674
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,210
get young people involved Penn manors

675
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,809
High School where kids help install

676
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,970
software on the computers for the the

677
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,360
rest of the students they also help do

678
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,710
some of the hardware fixes they you know

679
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,389
they're learning how to

680
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:39,129
like the helpdesk and all of these

681
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,929
different things and they feel really

682
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,899
part of the IT department at their

683
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,269
school which is really exciting

684
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,509
OSU that's open Oregon State University

685
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,459
they have an open-source laboratory they

686
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,989
host a lot of amazing free software

687
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:55,389
projects on their servers but students

688
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:57,820
are training to be sis admins and

689
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,579
learning how to do DevOps type stuff

690
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,659
through the school and so it's like a

691
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:03,279
really great place where they're

692
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,829
teaching their students about the

693
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,320
importance of giving back to the free

694
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,729
and open-source software community but

695
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,919
also like giving them the actual

696
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,499
specific skills to like host a server

697
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,440
and deal with emails and calls about

698
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,570
outages and things like that kept a

699
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,879
quick sec yeah so if you are a professor

700
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:24,459
or a teacher consider assigning projects

701
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,649
where people can get involved in free

702
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:28,559
software

703
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,629
oh it's more me okay great

704
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,089
there are maker days some places have

705
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,159
them you know there are simple projects

706
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,979
designed to be comfortable and welcoming

707
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:41,679
and friendly and easy there are two

708
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,299
particular organizations who don't

709
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,829
necessarily host maker days but I've

710
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,359
taken the idea of what maker days

711
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,690
accomplish one of them is like a summer

712
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,419
camp after-school program called parts

713
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:54,369
and crafts who've constructed these

714
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:56,919
pretty simple kits based around

715
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,200
interesting things in technology that

716
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,669
they then send out to you and you can

717
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,649
build them and play with them but all of

718
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:04,629
their documentation is under an open

719
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:06,459
document is under the open documentation

720
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,200
license which means that they're also

721
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,529
encouraging people to go and modify the

722
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:13,119
documentation to kind of make notes

723
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,649
about things that they did with it that

724
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,359
were either difficult or exciting or new

725
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,269
or how they changed it public labs is a

726
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,609
citizen science group that also designs

727
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,859
tools and they also you know they're

728
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,959
part of the open hardware Association

729
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,089
and they are also producing all their

730
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:30,729
documentation under an open

731
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,159
documentation license to encourage

732
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,190
people to again make these changes to

733
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,509
share them to participate in these

734
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,309
communities like in these free

735
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,950
technology communities in pretty simple

736
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,859
starting ways there's scratch and

737
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,139
minecraft and maybe other things I

738
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,350
learned recently that I'm old now too

739
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,000
not an advanced worker but I'm old

740
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,190
according to some statistics I read so I

741
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,330
don't know what the kids are doing these

742
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,309
days but you know there are these

743
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,289
wonderful tools that are designed to be

744
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,260
easy and to introduce oh there's little

745
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,809
bits little bits is also super cool

746
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,340
there are these tools designed to make

747
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,799
getting involved in things in developing

748
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,510
some kind of technical skills or at

749
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,059
least technical understandings about how

750
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,260
things are put together and how

751
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,260
technology works also there are kids

752
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,450
days at big Foss conferences those are

753
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,730
super cool I hear they're really fun I'm

754
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,110
don't think I'd be allowed to go to them

755
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,330
unless I borrowed someone's child no no

756
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,100
kids actually give presentations and I

757
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,929
saw an adorable ten-minute presentation

758
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,710
on how awesome open hatches from someone

759
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,929
who had to stand on something to be seen

760
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:48,030
over the podium that was pretty great

761
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,530
but yeah there's if you already have the

762
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,590
space then why not set some space aside

763
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,200
for kids and you know then people can

764
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,789
bring their kids instead of leave them

765
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:02,590
at home oh yeah so some great stuff

766
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,210
that's happening to get older people

767
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,640
involved if people are not already

768
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,230
familiar with outreach it's pretty

769
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,990
awesome it's a paid internship to work

770
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,210
on free and open source software but

771
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,270
it's not only for students and it's it's

772
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,470
specifically for people from

773
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,030
underrepresented groups like women and

774
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,309
other minorities but a lot of the people

775
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:22,840
who take advantage of it or women who

776
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,610
are returning to the workforce so it's

777
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,980
very exciting they're their fundraising

778
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,450
now because they're part of the

779
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,940
Conservancy with a match they just they

780
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,460
just kicked off a donation match

781
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,340
supporter membership funding dry I just

782
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,690
threw too many words in their funding

783
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,919
drive so if you're not a member you

784
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,360
should become one hundred fifty people

785
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,799
and they'll get a great match donation

786
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,299
they're great yeah that's our club open

787
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,309
search comm which is a website that has

788
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,890
articles and interviews about people

789
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,260
working in free and open source software

790
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,929
they have a really diverse age pool of

791
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:59,290
participation it's great because writing

792
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,010
is one of those things

793
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,290
it takes a little less time to get

794
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,900
acclimated to doing than code so it's

795
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,030
really great for people who have like a

796
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,950
little bit of time or don't want to do

797
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,500
something technical but want to help I

798
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,560
think there are also a number of online

799
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,510
resources that are designed to help you

800
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,730
learn how to code what's great about

801
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,800
them is especially code Academy is it's

802
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,810
not where it introduces you to some kind

803
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,820
of technical concept and that in the

804
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,590
hopes that your beautiful wonderful

805
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,330
creative mind will somehow make the leap

806
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,220
to application like how to think like a

807
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,160
computer scientist does so those are

808
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,720
cool and and volunteering with the

809
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,910
community run conferences is also really

810
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,430
great a lot of them have spaces for

811
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,570
people to kind of sit behind an

812
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,760
information desk and just like hand out

813
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,500
programs and talk about stuff and those

814
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,540
are all on ramps for becoming involved

815
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,510
with a community the key there is like

816
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,670
the next batch of things is to make sure

817
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,440
that the language that you put out when

818
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,020
you're looking for volunteers makes it

819
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,850
clear that you know you're not only

820
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,040
looking for like young hipsters or

821
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,470
something that you're you have lots of

822
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,260
different types of activities and and

823
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,300
that's the case with this with the

824
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,810
things in this category like sure I'm

825
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,360
sure people are familiar with these

826
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,750
concepts but these can be really great

827
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,790
ways to bring in a diverse group of

828
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,918
people from different ages and different

829
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,620
backgrounds if the language is correct

830
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,780
and welcoming and you know you take out

831
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,600
all the rockstar stuff or like we're

832
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,639
gonna you know we're gonna hang out this

833
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,219
conference and never sleep and that type

834
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,350
of thing that doesn't mean you have to

835
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,850
sleep I'm not I'm not

836
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,000
well I die I'm a fan of sleep but but if

837
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,949
you put out language and you think like

838
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,250
huh would I respond to that if I was 50

839
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,710
and then figure out why not you can also

840
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,418
ask people if you're not sure how your

841
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,090
language looks actually in in studies

842
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,120
done with language in advertising for

843
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,970
jobs and like internship and mentorship

844
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,640
programs you get higher numbers of

845
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,680
applicants who are in minority groups

846
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,240
once your language switches to things

847
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,330
like mentorship and learning and

848
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,520
community and groups and like spaces for

849
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,900
you to expand when you have that kind of

850
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,850
language as opposed to language like be

851
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,049
a rock star

852
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:16,369
the number of applicants is just

853
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,230
completely different right so the if you

854
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,119
set the expectation like we'll bring you

855
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,589
in and teach you as opposed to you

856
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:25,880
should already be XYZ sort of person so

857
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,089
some stuff that we'd like to see happen

858
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:31,549
is ways for kids to do non code stuff

859
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:34,010
like scratching minecraft are cool but I

860
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,869
don't know there must be nerdy children

861
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,490
out there that want to do documentation

862
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,650
maybe or something like that but that's

863
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,630
the point of public labs and parts and

864
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:47,569
crafts yeah and more places for older

865
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:50,089
people to do non code stuff I think you

866
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:52,990
had a point about this that a lot of

867
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,980
older people once they're retired

868
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,359
they've been in the workforce they know

869
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,069
how to do accounting they know how to do

870
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:59,540
event work they know how to do writing

871
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,420
and they could do it for us in the free

872
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,460
software movement we just have to make

873
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,960
sure they know that we want them to come

874
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,869
over that's yeah there are plenty of

875
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,700
people who leave work to have children

876
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,559
some of them are mothers and some of

877
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,660
them are fathers and making the

878
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,040
transition from being a stay-at-home

879
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,470
parent to working full-time or even

880
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,270
part-time is hard under the best

881
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,609
circumstances as far as I can tell I

882
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:26,380
don't have children

883
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,299
neither does Deb no you didn't need to

884
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:30,799
know that about that some of that about

885
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:33,069
us I'm sorry

886
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:36,079
and it's especially rough in technology

887
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,940
though when you're looking at things

888
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,049
that are moving forward that are

889
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,270
changing pretty rapidly you know if you

890
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,980
have your experience from a few years

891
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,359
ago and everybody was doing cool stuff

892
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,369
with Java and then suddenly everybody

893
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,140
wants c-sharp programmers and you're

894
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,280
just like I don't you know what c-sharp

895
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,250
is o youth and junior affinity groups

896
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,930
within communities there are a lot of

897
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,030
good examples of this outside of

898
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,760
technology like there are like Young

899
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,680
Republicans and Young Democrats there

900
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,460
are youth groups within churches so

901
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,109
maybe we should have some more youth

902
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,970
groups and free software you had an idea

903
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,790
for the other vets you wanted for the

904
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:20,150
debian yeah yeah and all ages events at

905
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,640
conferences we're really bringing back

906
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,990
this event thing again and again and

907
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,549
part of that is that events are really

908
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,160
fun and it's much easier to be

909
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,660
excited about being involved in a

910
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,730
community when you already like the

911
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,740
people there and you have emotional

912
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,170
investment in them so one way this can

913
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,819
look is when you have your social event

914
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:40,700
at night don't just go to a bar I mean

915
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,069
the bars are fun and we're not saying

916
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,230
don't go to a bar at all the point is

917
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,150
have other things that are going on as

918
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,420
well maybe you want to have like a game

919
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,160
night or a game space next to another

920
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
space which is what scale does I believe

921
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,640
yes scale does it starts out

922
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,710
family-friendly game night and then

923
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,440
people kind of trickle in from the bar

924
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,690
and then it like the kids go to bed and

925
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,089
it switches over and I add one Deb Kampf

926
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:08,210
in Portland the night started out with

927
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,250
games and then it later transitioned to

928
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,809
all the adults just drinking lots of

929
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:14,809
wine and the key is to be clear if it's

930
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,700
gonna be family-friendly say so so

931
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,990
people know to bring their kids and then

932
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,940
if it's not you also say so so you

933
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,200
couldn't have two different kinds of

934
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,299
events or you can have a mixed event or

935
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:27,109
something like that so making space is

936
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:28,280
really important we're running out of

937
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,630
time I'm gonna talk a little more

938
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,059
quickly I'm sorry making space is really

939
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,789
important this doesn't just mean having

940
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:36,500
places where people can be vulnerable

941
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,119
and share that they don't understand

942
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,039
things but also to make spaces for

943
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,859
people to move up or progress right you

944
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:45,440
need to be comfortable sitting down when

945
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,710
someone else has the turn to stand up

946
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,970
and some ways to do this you can have

947
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,160
someone shadow you you can make sure

948
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,510
that you're sort of spreading out your

949
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,329
work and you have people who are always

950
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:59,270
learning like a piece of what you do if

951
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,369
you're the senior person yeah having new

952
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,099
people do keynotes is a great way to do

953
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:08,930
that and I had another thought but I

954
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,400
remember sorry so here's a call to

955
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,319
action which means you should start to

956
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:17,119
think about your questions so uh we want

957
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,160
you to find ways to bring people in to

958
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,869
communities and make them feel

959
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,109
comfortable and you know to communicate

960
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:26,150
what is awesome about your community for

961
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,150
people of all different ages so you know

962
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,250
making sure that if if you do actually

963
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,770
want like a full age spectrum of people

964
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,140
that your language reflects that and

965
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,750
then when they do show up

966
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,400
sure you empower these new folks to

967
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,830
become like real decision making members

968
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,780
of your community who are like truly

969
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,210
empowered to participate and be involved

970
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,280
in all aspects so you gave them access

971
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,690
to important information make sure

972
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,250
they're invited to all the meetings and

973
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,580
that kind of thing so that way then you

974
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,260
can just like get out of their way and

975
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,200
they'll bring in more new people so this

976
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,540
is how you avoid having it be tokenistic

977
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,830
real quick

978
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,780
kind of anecdote on that is sp I

979
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,550
recently added a member to their board

980
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,680
who'd only been really involved with

981
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,880
free software for I think about a year

982
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,710
at that point and she was just super

983
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,480
enthusiastic cool so you can tweet at us

984
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,740
or other social platforms with that tag

985
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,320
or these are Twitter handles and then we

986
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,170
would be happy to take your questions so

987
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,050
thanks so much for listening

988
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:39,380
[Applause]

989
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,460
okay it's not Chappell by the way it's

990
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,530
not Chappell by the way and why should

991
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,180
being a doctor be any better than being

992
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,370
a nurse being a good nurse is fantastic

993
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,950
[Music]

994
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,380
anyway I'm standing up so people can see

995
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,680
that I'm old I don't look good in a

996
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,300
t-shirt right

997
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,460
I can't I came last night to the

998
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,050
delirium tremens and the guy at the door

999
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,750
quizzed me as if I were some belt fat

1000
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,430
Belgian walk who was trying to wander

1001
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,080
into the delirium tremens and I had to

1002
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,300
prove my chops by talking about penguins

1003
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,120
that I came to a little conference

1004
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,120
called off steam 17 years ago me and 400

1005
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,230
other people from Europe came to the

1006
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,630
original Austin conference people change

1007
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,460
people get older and we don't all have

1008
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,310
beards and and t-shirts with with them

1009
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:39,990
geckos and and on them ok great so

1010
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,759
fantastic talk thank you thank you

1011
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,720
I guess I also have less of a question

1012
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,279
but one of the one of the things you

1013
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,099
mentioned finding non-code of things for

1014
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,859
young people and older people to do one

1015
00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:59,420
of the things I found that has been

1016
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,980
super good for both the youngest and the

1017
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,109
oldest is making kind of explanation

1018
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,259
videos people love making these videos

1019
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,839
where they teach people their age how to

1020
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:11,480
do stuff or teach people in like in the

1021
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,799
older generations younger than them in

1022
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,809
many cases but like for the young people

1023
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,670
they love teaching like they're their

1024
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,680
classmates and having videos explaining

1025
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,900
how to do stuff and those are super easy

1026
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,339
to get people to do if you give them a

1027
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,839
video and as soon as they see a few

1028
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,700
people liking their thing there don't do

1029
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,519
tons cool and there was a question over

1030
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:35,509
there you you said that you would say

1031
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,180
why 35 is important and I think I missed

1032
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,849
it because I only were 35 is important

1033
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,730
oh yeah 30 so 35 is important like as a

1034
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,920
demographic point because like they

1035
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,259
separate people into older than 35 and

1036
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:49,789
younger especially when looking at like

1037
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:55,940
shopping but the VC guy he said that you

1038
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,829
know people over 35 don't have good

1039
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:08,869
ideas are they good yeah that's a great

1040
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:09,549
idea

1041
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:14,990
other places oh yes hi great talk thank

1042
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,380
you and I work at a tech company and on

1043
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,480
the diversity team and we often struggle

1044
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
with representation on panels so I did a

1045
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,250
quick count of the number of speakers at

1046
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,109
FOSDEM today there are men and the

1047
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:28,880
number of women what is your advice in

1048
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,809
kind of inclusive inclusivity in terms

1049
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:36,559
of representation events like this so I

1050
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,839
think that like the biggest thing that

1051
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:40,400
you can do to get a diverse

1052
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,500
representation on a panel is to start

1053
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,519
really early so if you ask the same for

1054
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,079
women that everyone asked to be on a

1055
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,299
panel on a particular topic three weeks

1056
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:51,859
before that panel they're all going to

1057
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:54,890
be busy and say no so if you have this

1058
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,480
idea that you want to have a panel and

1059
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
you want it to be diverse then you need

1060
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,930
be asking people a few months in advance

1061
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,270
so especially women who may have

1062
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,160
childcare duties and other things they

1063
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,260
have to jostle around before they can

1064
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,619
commit you have to start early it's a

1065
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,599
lot of it's like it's pretty heavily

1066
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,609
based on outreach so you really have to

1067
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,980
be willing to go where people are I

1068
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,420
don't know if you're talking about like

1069
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,099
within the context of a company or a

1070
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:21,049
project but part of that also might just

1071
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,819
be trying to get more people like

1072
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:24,980
working for it in general and thinking

1073
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,020
about recruitment strategies one of the

1074
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,700
biggest things you can do is explicitly

1075
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,890
change your language and not just

1076
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,510
focusing on things like mentorship or

1077
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,970
learning or growth but also focusing on

1078
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,220
like pretty explicitly stating hey you

1079
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,559
know this is our anti-discrimination

1080
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:46,940
policy say like can you recommend

1081
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,770
someone up-and-coming that I might not

1082
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,230
be aware of who could participate on

1083
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,990
this panel I have a great secret list of

1084
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,089
semi secret lists of really awesome

1085
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:58,160
minority free and open source software

1086
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,470
speakers so you could like hit me up for

1087
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,709
it

1088
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,130
hi first of all I'd like to say I agree

1089
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,190
with you on the whole I think older

1090
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,930
people like I think a lot about my mom

1091
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,640
who's interested in free software feel

1092
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,079
like they're being told that this is not

1093
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,720
really for them and there is something

1094
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,039
quite subversive in telling them

1095
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,329
actually it is for you and you should

1096
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:22,670
not feel excluded from this and you can

1097
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,529
understand it a lot of older people are

1098
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,630
basically being told give up it's not

1099
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,190
for you or buy this expensive shiny

1100
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,930
thing they'll do it for you so I agree

1101
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,760
with you on the whole my question

1102
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,029
however is more about some some stuff

1103
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:36,619
I've seen online basically some sort of

1104
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,950
elitist old-school hacker Eric Raymond

1105
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,349
crap that is telling us oh yeah but

1106
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:43,339
we're just going to try and get the

1107
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:45,650
special snowflakes in and dilute our

1108
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,460
elite skills how do we go back against

1109
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,190
that it's it's clearly quite stupid we

1110
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,849
need more people yeah what's your advice

1111
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:57,470
about that I want to make a really quick

1112
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,660
comment about your comment which is my

1113
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,720
mother works in IT and she's like oh

1114
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,309
free software isn't for me it's too hard

1115
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:05,990
and complicated I'm not sure I could use

1116
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,339
it so I face this problem all the time

1117
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,559
yeah so

1118
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,269
I think what you're kind of getting at

1119
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:16,809
is that like this I think sort of

1120
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,449
mythical idea that by making our

1121
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:21,099
communities more diverse we're somehow

1122
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:25,180
lowering the bar which I I mean one I

1123
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,209
think that's Foss like it's really easy

1124
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:29,709
to create communities that are

1125
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:30,939
comfortable for the people who are

1126
00:46:30,939 --> 00:46:33,249
already there and it's a matter of

1127
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,199
figuring out like do you want more

1128
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,239
diverse participation than it means like

1129
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:40,299
you know education is a really good

1130
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:41,799
example like you talk to people in

1131
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,989
they're like oh yeah like so I invited

1132
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:46,119
teachers to come to our 8:30 p.m.

1133
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,609
meetings guess what teachers at least in

1134
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,499
the u.s. think it up like really really

1135
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:52,809
early it's not that they want like

1136
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,989
special hand-holding treatment it's that

1137
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,630
they're in bed you know so so a lot of

1138
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,579
times it's something like that that's

1139
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:04,180
not that's like could be logistical or

1140
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,859
it could be a language thing that's like

1141
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,469
you know if your company has

1142
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,150
mustache-growing contest then you're not

1143
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,039
gonna have a ton of women applying not

1144
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,079
because they're like special snowflakes

1145
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,939
but because they're like yeah that

1146
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:17,739
sounds like a bunch of man babies that I

1147
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:20,170
don't want to work with anyone who says

1148
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,259
to you that by including more people

1149
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,939
from underrepresented groups into your

1150
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:26,589
project as lowering the bar is actually

1151
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:31,449
just wrong there's been I hear some

1152
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,029
clapping yes there there you know there

1153
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:36,729
have been Studies on this right when you

1154
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,769
encourage you like when you encourage

1155
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,929
women to take math classes they do

1156
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:44,799
better than men do on average right and

1157
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:47,079
when you encourage like people of color

1158
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,289
to participate in like academic field

1159
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:52,989
that you know when you're like oh they

1160
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:56,589
can't you're like oh I'm sorry they're

1161
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:58,150
specifically a thing about swimming

1162
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,949
that's an example here there's this kind

1163
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:01,150
of like thing where it's like black

1164
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,130
people can't swim but it turns out that

1165
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,439
black swimmers do better than white

1166
00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:12,609
swimmers frequently thank you for the

1167
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:13,959
presentation thank you for the

1168
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:16,689
inspiration the recipes the guidelines

1169
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,789
that you try can find myself in in all

1170
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:22,479
of those I myself also involved in a

1171
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,550
couple of

1172
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,490
public and social initiatives under the

1173
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,920
radar for the common good Chitra Chitra

1174
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,460
now through the years what bothers me is

1175
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,270
that yeah in the end you have to find

1176
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,350
the kind of win-win situation where you

1177
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,640
can find a ensure balance between engage

1178
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,680
motivation and interest and at the end

1179
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,380
getting a product or service that is for

1180
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,170
the common good because we are mainly

1181
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,610
here working on open source in this case

1182
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,510
now did you come to sometimes the

1183
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,119
reflection that despite all those

1184
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,810
recipes and guidelines you can not find

1185
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,080
every time on systematically the right

1186
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,900
balance the right match to get all the

1187
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,730
people involved that you would like to

1188
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,300
involve and engage and that at the end

1189
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,350
you miss something that you can find in

1190
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,869
the private sector being paying people

1191
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:31,119
for work it's out and I don't have the

1192
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,550
answer myself but it's a recurrent

1193
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,380
so-die I ask myself okay we're all

1194
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,570
engaging all those people for producing

1195
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,280
something for the common good for

1196
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,070
everyone in fact but and the other

1197
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:51,510
science work deserves compensation but

1198
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,930
later I have some thoughts on it thank

1199
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,200
you again for coming and we look forward

1200
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,430
to working with you on building and

1201
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,359
all-ages fast movement

1202
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,110
you
