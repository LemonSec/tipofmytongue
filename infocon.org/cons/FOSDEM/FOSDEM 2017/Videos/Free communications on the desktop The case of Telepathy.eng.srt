1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,799
good morning thank you for coming so

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:11,270
today I'm going to talk about free

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,580
communication on the desktop and

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,440
specifically here specifically I'm going

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,400
to talk about the telepathy project for

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,430
those of you that don't know me few

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,189
words about myself I'm an old KD and

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,820
telepathic contributor I started back in

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,920
2009 with a google Summer of Code

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,519
project related to KD telepathy and

11
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,970
nowadays I work on gstreamer totally

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,890
different however last year I was kind

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,890
of bored I wanted to do something as

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,659
apart from the streamer and I started

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:56,869
looking at communications because it's

16
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:59,530
something that bothers me when I work

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,059
communication is kind of hard so one

18
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,390
problem is that basically nowadays of

19
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,770
the communication happens from the

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,030
mobile we have I have like three four

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,490
different apps on my phone to talk to

22
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,860
different people and that kind of sucks

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,780
and when when I'm on the computer and I

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,630
want to talk to them I took the best way

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,310
to do that is to just open their

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,590
respective websites because all of them

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,040
have web apps so I loved my browser with

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,430
three four different tabs of heavy web

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,320
sites and all that just to talk to some

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,340
people so yeah it bothers me that there

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,720
is no good way to do that on the desktop

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,760
and of course there are some open source

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,940
applications on the desktop that are

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,710
quite ok to use but some of them they

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,950
are for specific protocols some of them

36
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,810
like for example

37
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,360
pigging or similar things they are key

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,160
but I don't really like them so I was

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:33,800
looking at again and I thought yeah why

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,430
not why is this project dying so yeah I

41
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,959
maybe you've heard of that project

42
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,600
before what is it it's basically it's

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,400
implementing it's a framework

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,080
implementing instant messaging as

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,760
desktop service every protocol backend

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,769
is a different process and all the

47
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,940
communication with the user interfaces

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,760
is done through the bus and you can have

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,099
of course more than one user interface

50
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,610
sharing the same connection because of

51
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,370
the of this architecture this graph is

52
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,940
quite old

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,459
I know MSN doesn't exist I was too lazy

54
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,410
to change it so a quick history lesson

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,230
about the project started around 2005

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,470
2006 I think it was developed actively

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,049
for the Nokia's my mo and media

58
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,790
platforms at some points empathy and

59
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,640
Katy's letter telepathy kicked in the

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,549
two respective user interfaces for

61
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:46,370
genome and KD but the project was told

62
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,989
around 2013 and it was the point where

63
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,120
people were working on releasing version

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,700
1.0 which goes about cleaning and

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,209
cleaning up api and doing some porting

66
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:02,139
which I'll talk about later

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,000
where my notes so yeah when I joined

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,130
last year I try to see what's the state

69
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,950
and I saw that there is there was

70
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,870
activity all these years in telepathy

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,669
cute in the telepathic each library

72
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,990
which is the cute API to talk to the tea

73
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,350
bus services and there are people that

74
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,530
were I think and still are working on

75
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,850
those kids based connection managers

76
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,840
connection managers are the processes

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,880
that actually implement the protocols

78
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,639
right and they provide just this

79
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,850
connection to the user interface there

80
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,389
are like we have these production

81
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,190
managers feed based connection managers

82
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,410
at the moment with telepathic mores for

83
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,460
the telegram protocol telepathy nonsense

84
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,520
which is an effort to redo the example

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,250
big connection with the cute API and

86
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,870
some other connection wonders as well

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,850
that I I put the question mark there

88
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,320
because I don't know what their state is

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,229
but it's telepathy kangkang for hangouts

90
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,350
a telepathy reciprocate and telepathy

91
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,530
bell for the ring protocol with there's

92
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,620
a talk later about this one so I joined

93
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,260
I saw this activity and then I saw that

94
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,760
the jalebi site was not being worked on

95
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
we have also telepathy lib

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,289
the G Lib API to talk to the T bus

97
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,289
services and a couple of dilip based

98
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,380
connection managers for XMPP for IRC for

99
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,460
[Music]

100
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,610
and get started working on that a bit

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,919
did some releases from the Chile based

102
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,270
connection managers and then after

103
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,050
discussion with the other guys in the

104
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,550
project

105
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,180
we thought we should finish the 1.0

106
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,730
release effort because it will make

107
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,250
things easier both for us and for new

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,530
contributors in the future because it

109
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,910
cleans up the API a lot the API right

110
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,610
now is a bit over engineered I think and

111
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,730
yeah there is also some work to pour

112
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,880
telepathy lib to use it bus instead of

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,440
the battling which is a bit painful

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,400
telepath acute also needs some API

115
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,620
rework to make it easier for people to

116
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,070
use it so that that's what what's

117
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,780
happening now

118
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,110
we also recently moved the repositories

119
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,760
to github because it was easier for us

120
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,730
to work there previously we were on free

121
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,920
desktop and still are actually then the

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,710
website is on free desktop repositories

123
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,160
are also free desktop and we sync

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,740
synchronize them but yeah the main

125
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,260
development is done here and there are a

126
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,980
couple of plans for the future like

127
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,440
ideas we had that we would like to see

128
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,460
implement it at some point implement

129
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,710
some modern chat features which are not

130
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,100
there like being able to see server-side

131
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,580
logs many protocols do that nowadays do

132
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,860
chat lists instead of contact list you

133
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,540
know the thing that you see one day on

134
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,580
your workshop or messenger when you

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,160
telegram when you open the app you see

136
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,230
list of charts instead of seeing the

137
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,610
list of contacts contacts is a very old

138
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,480
idea media messages as well there is

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,800
support for that partial but it needs

140
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,610
some work another idea is to implement a

141
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,100
better graphical user interface

142
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,010
something more modern something that

143
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,520
corresponds more to God people are used

144
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,059
to nowadays that doesn't essentially

145
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,490
mean rewriting everything we could

146
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,500
improve the existing applications but

147
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,270
any any idea is welcome there's some

148
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,850
connection emerges for for other modern

149
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:54,980
protocols like matrix or talks also we

150
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,450
would like to improve compatibility with

151
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,670
proprietary protocols because that's

152
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,710
where most of the user bases if you if

153
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,340
you're not compatible with those it's

154
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,890
hard to keep people using it because

155
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,930
they will always switch to something

156
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,280
else when they want to talk to their

157
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,879
friends that are not on XMPP for example

158
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,449
so yeah a couple of ideas skypes themed

159
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,389
messenger these things are I think they

160
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,519
can be somehow connected and also

161
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,319
another thing that I would like to see

162
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,869
is reduce production fragmentation right

163
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:35,850
now I know there are patches around in

164
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,959
selfie shows going to phone mostly for

165
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,929
the ring connection monitor which is

166
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,379
then the collection manager for the

167
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,550
cellular protocol the GSM protocol

168
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,619
because these companies use this use

169
00:09:53,619 --> 00:10:02,939
telepathy in their phones actually and

170
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:08,439
yeah well this soul is a lot to do for

171
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:15,149
me and the other guys so we need you

172
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,999
there are a couple of tasks right now we

173
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,839
want to finish version 1.0 as I said

174
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,519
there is a lot of work in maintaining

175
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,809
connection monitors we have double four

176
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:36,370
XMPP salute for link-local XMPP case

177
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,629
which is a compatibility later layer for

178
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,929
exposing clip purple protocols so we can

179
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,040
use whatever lip purple has on telepathy

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,420
Idol for IRC ring for cellular as I said

181
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,249
rakia for sip which I don't know if the

182
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,069
back end is being maintained it's based

183
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,420
on Sophia sip I don't think that's

184
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,839
maintained but anyways and yeah we'd

185
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,920
like to also work on missing features on

186
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,679
the connection Marge's it would be very

187
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,069
nice for for people to have to be to be

188
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,769
compliant with XMPP

189
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,879
compliance rate 2016 and also it would

190
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,000
be nice to be able to support more lip

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,790
features in case right now we want to

192
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,030
support text chats we could do more and

193
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,500
it would increase our protocol span a

194
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,850
lot because we purple has a lot of

195
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,670
protocols implemented another thing that

196
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,930
you could do is come up with a new

197
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,660
client I don't know or improve on one of

198
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,010
the existing ones in a way that makes it

199
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,340
more modern and more appealing to users

200
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,730
and yeah that was everything I had to

201
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,600
say any questions yes priorities and

202
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,700
future directions I was wondering to

203
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:32,710
open communications protocol a wide

204
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,770
range of protocols but kind of I think

205
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,240
maybe the best things that the core

206
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,860
enthusiastic people and developers can

207
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,270
do is is connect with other groups that

208
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:49,540
are trying to do the same thing please

209
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,260
repeat the question yeah so if I

210
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,150
understand the connection right is the

211
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,940
question right is you are acting if we

212
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,089
have a certain direction in specific

213
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,710
features that we would like to work on

214
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,440
with with other communities is that what

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,470
you're asking really I want to suggest

216
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,640
that talking to these other communities

217
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,380
and trying to work together is a good

218
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,180
and things that add to your future

219
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,100
directories yeah I think so definitely

220
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,060
[Music]

221
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,150
it's like everything is open we are open

222
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,070
to discussing with other communities of

223
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,720
course and that's one of the reasons I

224
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,510
came here to give this talk is try to

225
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,110
see what the other people are doing

226
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,450
engage into talks and maybe come up with

227
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,060
very specific directions that we could

228
00:13:44,060 --> 00:14:00,650
move so for example matrix is not just

229
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,580
message passing

230
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,480
it's chat synchronization so it's

231
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,450
possible like you receive some messages

232
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,550
so the question is if if telepathy

233
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,340
supports message synchronization

234
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,030
like matrix that some messages may come

235
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,390
later and they may be in a different

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,200
order than they actually arrive so that

237
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,760
the answer is no we don't have good

238
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,340
support for that but it's something that

239
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,390
we would like to do it's seen in the

240
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,880
modern features pool that we would like

241
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,760
to implement because yes it's essential

242
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,350
that we support things like that

243
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,400
such as I mention the guy that priest

244
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,940
which either for Couture them babies but

245
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,220
I see they're still using and eventually

246
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,240
improving I'm not sure if Giovanni has

247
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,650
more money you know the state of course

248
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:27,820
obviously with this which is what did to

249
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,920
updating pixie backs

250
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,780
[Music]

251
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,599
[Music]

252
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,820
okay so the this was not a question it

253
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,980
was an intervention that Sophia sip is

254
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,440
still being worked on in the free street

255
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,580
project and yes we would definitely come

256
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,850
to that when we think

257
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,160
[Music]

258
00:17:40,160 --> 00:18:07,530
yes yes yes so the the the intervention

259
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,130
was that maybe it's better to focus on

260
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,890
telepathy haze which brings protocols

261
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,600
from deep purple because Lipper because

262
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,410
it yeah it basically cuts down our

263
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,400
maintenance and makes us use very

264
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,750
updated code base I agree in some degree

265
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:37,380
yes I I like to have Shay's support more

266
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,740
things and focus and usually purple more

267
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,800
because that exactly what you said but I

268
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,200
I don't want to stop there because we

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,000
can we can do more but

270
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,559
Roberto rather contribute to your own

271
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,809
death projects which will never eat the

272
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:10,929
same so you are I think the the reason

273
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,700
is that some people may not be

274
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,160
comfortable in coding in G Lib and

275
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,610
Clippers Linda that's that's why I mean

276
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,860
people who work on the telegram

277
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,390
connection manager right now they take

278
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,080
you scoot

279
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,570
they are cute developers so I I can tell

280
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,540
them to just go just stop doing that

281
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,340
go Dooley purple it's not

282
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,830
of all the features that needed in

283
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,870
dinner parties for example I was looking

284
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:11,140
at the support for Scott it can support

285
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,210
your own messages

286
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,260
I mean if for example you say from

287
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,830
another client you want to see this

288
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:29,890
message in the client that works but yes

289
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,540
I'm sorry but you're gonna have a

290
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,050
discussion

291
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:45,660
[Applause]
