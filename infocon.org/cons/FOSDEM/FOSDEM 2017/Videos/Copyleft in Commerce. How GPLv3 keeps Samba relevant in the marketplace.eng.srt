1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,140
everybody

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:12,059
Jeremy Allison hi thanks very much for

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,940
coming to my talk we had a little

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,100
technical difficulties so the top and

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,820
bottom of the slides maybe maybe a

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,439
little from catered I'm afraid no I have

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,519
to work around that so my name is Jeremy

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,550
Allison and the co-creator of the Samba

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,060
free software project my day job is

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,610
working for Google open source programs

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,130
office but I want to make absolutely

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,620
clear and the best way of doing this is

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,390
by doing layers like this sorry this is

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,710
no Google Talk

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm gonna be saying things here that

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,530
Google don't agree with this is the view

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,830
of myself and quite possibly the Samba

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,540
project so I'm going to be talking about

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,438
gplv3

20
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,619
this is not a Google Talk so if I if I

21
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,020
see any press ENTER or anything later

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,320
saying Google engineer says eh I shall

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,619
be really cross and probably shafted up

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,560
my boss and be I'll just deny ever

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,670
having said it as a Google engineer I'll

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,729
you know using the the latest theory of

27
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,280
fake news I'll just say no I never said

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,710
that and who are you going to believe

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,990
you know me or your own lying eyes so

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,299
yeah this is this is a Samba related

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,109
talk not Google related Bradley asked me

32
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,200
to give a talk on how GPL was affected

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,450
if you're moving to GPL v3 has affected

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,299
samba I already gave a talk a few years

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,280
ago on why we did it I'm gonna talk

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
about what the consequences are and what

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,420
I I think have the GPL is moving to GPL

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,109
v3 has affected us it started off as a

39
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,350
nice fluffy how to use GPL v3 to get

40
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,258
companies to work with you kind of

41
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,360
commerce GPL in commerce talk as you may

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,319
have seen from the abstract it kind of

43
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,970
got darker than that as

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,640
to write it for some reason I got angry

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,090
and angrier and and as you'll see what

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,740
more of the anger came out in the talk

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,880
possibly than I intended so just going

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,060
back you know copyleft has always been

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,810
commercial the early funding of the free

50
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,940
software foundation was Richard selling

51
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,420
those big Sun and other tapes and

52
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,980
shipping them out

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,110
interestingly enough the the early days

54
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,090
of Samba

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,810
one of the first requests we ever had

56
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,480
was from the australian defence

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,200
establishment who insisted on having an

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,160
invoice sent by tridge force amber to

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,200
them so that they could use it so he

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,360
carefully made up an invoice for zero

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,910
dollars and sent that in and apparently

62
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,740
their accountants were perfectly happy

63
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,320
with that so long as they they had a

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,940
piece of paper saying that they had the

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,200
right to use the software and they had

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,880
an invoice and that they had paid it and

67
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,530
it was I don't know whether they sent

68
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,010
him a check back for $0 and the other

69
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,459
the other thing was when I first moved

70
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,500
to SGI who were doing a sama based

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,709
product one of the first things that SGI

72
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,380
did at that time was to essentially

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,690
realize that Red Hat was making a lot of

74
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,330
money and started charging for samba

75
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,269
support contracts because there's my vp

76
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,250
said at the time nobody values what

77
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,739
they're getting for free so the idea

78
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,709
that copyleft is you know non-commercial

79
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,860
obviously Red Hat but that I get to bed

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,840
a long time ago in fact you know I get

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,330
paid to write DPL v3 software so gplv2

82
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,820
everybody loves GPL v2 right is anyone

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,709
here old enough to remember working with

84
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,170
corporate lawyers who basically accused

85
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,150
you of being a communist trying to

86
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,459
destroy the software industry because

87
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,750
you were using good old GPL v2 the the

88
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,419
the yeah thank you the the the license

89
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,880
that now people say oh man that thing's

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,039
great I understand that it fits like an

91
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,200
old shoe

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,250
just so happy about gplv2 walking shoes

93
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,940
it's at the time that people were

94
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,290
lawyers corporate lawyers were

95
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,810
absolutely and utterly terrified on it

96
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,530
and in fact the Linux kernel has seemed

97
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,960
to have adopted that well gplv2 is great

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,610
we don't need anything else why would

99
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,590
you ever change why are you causing

100
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,060
trouble

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,730
we were sama was one of the earliest

102
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,670
adopters of gplv3

103
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,550
well as you can't see there the software

104
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,840
world is much more complicated now than

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,980
it was in 1991 when GPO v2 was published

106
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,390
and in fact let me take you back to the

107
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,110
years of 2007 which was when GPL v3 was

108
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,040
first getting created so there were

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,250
three issues I don't know whether people

110
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,430
remember this at the time that were

111
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,960
emerging that made at least myself and

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,190
obviously the free software foundation

113
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,800
think that GPL v2 was becoming was was

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,010
not built to address it address some of

115
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,240
these things but not not fully not in a

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,850
way that the FSF felt protected the

117
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,590
investments in GPL software that were

118
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,440
being made so the first one is the

119
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,570
Microsoft Novell agreement anyone

120
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,480
remember that oh yeah yeah I quit my job

121
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,150
at Novella over that and ended up at

122
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,280
Google what a shame so suppose that

123
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,420
wasn't so bad so that I now go into that

124
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,370
more in the next slide essentially that

125
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,030
was an attempt to add additional

126
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,200
conditions to violate GPL section 7 to

127
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,630
add additional conditions that would

128
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,520
contradict the license I first remember

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
when I first saw that agreement I was

130
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
actually I think it was just after

131
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,680
FOSDEM and I was in England visiting my

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,890
family and one of the Novell lawyers

133
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,170
email me this and said yeah maybe you

134
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,800
should take a look at this see

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,199
let me know what you think and I email

136
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,289
back saying why is this not a section 7

137
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,229
violation of the GPL and the response I

138
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,569
got was thank you for your input please

139
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,180
delete the previous email so they went

140
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,770
ahead with it the second threat more

141
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,520
serious is of course software patents

142
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,039
and the fear at the time was that

143
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,379
essentially writing free software would

144
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,259
just collapse there would be lawsuits on

145
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,240
individual developers projects would be

146
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,090
unable to to create things and there

147
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,150
were rumblings at the time there was a

148
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,270
file system tuks 3 I think it was took 2

149
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,240
or took 3 that NetApp started claiming

150
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,690
was violating the waffle patents you

151
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,340
know there was that was publicly

152
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,580
abandoned possibly more due to the

153
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,810
temperament of the developer than

154
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,060
anything else but there were lots of

155
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,190
threats coming that patents were going

156
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,110
to end the world as we know it and of

157
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,669
course the final one was DRM and and and

158
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,469
the one that bugged me the most actually

159
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:59,860
was was DRM and I just I grew up in a

160
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,990
world where I was able to get access to

161
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,880
the source code of many of the devices

162
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,069
that I ran and if I didn't like them I

163
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,719
could I could put other software on

164
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,360
there and and the idea of a world where

165
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,190
things would completely lock down you

166
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,710
know what it essentially ruined the

167
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,060
utility of everything I'd learned

168
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,550
because what use is having the source

169
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,919
code if you can't do anything with it

170
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,110
yeah you can learn from it but if you

171
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,900
can't install it or anything it really

172
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,810
is not much use and and things have only

173
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,940
gotten worse since then I'm going to

174
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,328
that in a little little while so let's

175
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,630
talk about the Novell agreement it was

176
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,219
very interesting it was a patent

177
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,940
indemnification pact and it was

178
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,690
structured as a covenant not to sue and

179
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,550
essentially what it allowed Microsoft to

180
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,700
do was to charge Percy royalties on any

181
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,580
soozee Linux that was being shipped and

182
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,540
this was this was seen as it was the end

183
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,030
of the world it was going to turn GPL

184
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,360
software into proprietary software and

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,920
now there's actually a wonderful quote

186
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,140
from one of the VP's at Red Hat

187
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,630
basically saying after this Agreement in

188
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,790
one year's time Susie will have

189
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,160
collapsed there will only be red hat as

190
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,260
the last standing Linux distributor

191
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,800
etcetera which didn't happen but yeah I

192
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,040
was nice wishful thinking so thought

193
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,340
what actually did happen well it didn't

194
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,590
really matter because he essentially

195
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,130
companies violate section 7 all the time

196
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,880
and they do add additional conditions

197
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,560
uh yeah you can't see the last line

198
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,870
which says I don't have proof of this so

199
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,130
so what happened was they just kept

200
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,480
cross-licensing patents under NDA to

201
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,990
companies TomTom you name it the

202
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,030
interesting case was the the Barnes &

203
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,170
Noble one because they actually

204
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,380
published I think one of the proposed

205
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,330
agreements because they refused to sign

206
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,980
II eventually they did sign across

207
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,650
license at one point it was two billion

208
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,750
dollars a year business for Microsoft

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,880
which is you know I mean it's not a lot

210
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,860
for them it but it's not quite pocket

211
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,780
change either fund the department I

212
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,880
guess and they're still doing that but

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,410
the big thing that changed between the

214
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,630
the specific market often eval deal is

215
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,000
that and I genuinely believe this

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,660
Microsoft has changed and they now I

217
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,490
wouldn't say they're an open-source

218
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,440
company but they have learned to live

219
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,090
with open-source and we'll learn

220
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,570
increasingly learn to use it

221
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,150
commercially ongoing right I remember

222
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,270
having a dinner with a Microsoft VP in

223
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,060
Mountain View tired house and telling

224
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,460
him why don't you guys put sequel server

225
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,350
on Linux you're crazy you should have

226
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,190
done this years ago

227
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,800
you know why won't you do it and him

228
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,300
holding his head in his hands and saying

229
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,829
the windows team won't let me

230
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,510
you know they were frightened that it

231
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,550
was going to take away their monopoly

232
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,850
power on Windows and and now last year

233
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,710
sequel server is coming to Windows

234
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,120
change has come

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,300
Microsoft is no longer the threat to

236
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,340
free software and it's all about money

237
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,350
makes the world go round they finally

238
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,930
figured out how to make money on open

239
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,870
source free software and the other thing

240
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,820
is I've actually heard from engineers

241
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,620
because it's always engineers who Pasha

242
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,180
the real dirt the most companies who

243
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,030
want to do cross-licensing just do so

244
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,100
with no thought whatsoever to how this

245
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,170
is violating any of the terms they just

246
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,640
do it they do it under NDA

247
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,850
no one ever hears about it you know I

248
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,170
have no proof whatsoever I you know even

249
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,760
nobody will go on record of saying yes

250
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,280
my company signed an NDA agreement that

251
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,410
cross Latin cross license patents that

252
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,050
violated the GPO be two or three but

253
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,970
these things I believe happen all the

254
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,890
time if anyone wants to stand up and say

255
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,460
yes my company does that yeah great feel

256
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,020
free to do so I'd be very happy to talk

257
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,330
to you so that moves on to the to the

258
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,290
next thing that the gplv3 was trying to

259
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,630
address which is software patents and

260
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,520
that's if you can't see that's actually

261
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,030
a little map of East Texas the rocket

262
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,060
docket so Scott Peterson and I don't

263
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,290
think he's he's getting a lot of good

264
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,170
press in these talks so my fear was that

265
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,060
I was gonna get personally sued over

266
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,640
violating people's patents because I was

267
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,830
running software and you know I thought

268
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,330
if people wanted to stop something maybe

269
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,800
they're gonna sue me and maybe I'm gonna

270
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,080
lose my house and whatever and I'm a

271
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,270
wonderful foam-core with Scott Peterson

272
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,430
cuz he and I were both working at HP at

273
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,620
that time he said you no matter were you

274
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,700
idiot you don't have any money

275
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,980
he said you're poor HP has to worry

276
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,360
we've got the money so that actually

277
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,410
turned out to be absolutely true many

278
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,180
people patent trolls have sued it's

279
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,590
become a multi-billion dollar in

280
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,450
the stray mainly centered in East Texas

281
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,560
which is a very interesting place to

282
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,110
some there's a marvelous American I

283
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,790
think it's This American Life or Planet

284
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,160
Money do a wonderful they did a

285
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,650
wonderful podcast on the the companies

286
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,780
headquartered in East Texas that are

287
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,150
essentially a post-office box inside one

288
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,230
big building that are the patent trolls

289
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,430
and yes all software has suffered but it

290
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,650
hasn't specifically targeted free

291
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,560
software or open source I mean all

292
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,450
software sucks all software violence

293
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,840
patents nobody ever looks at patents

294
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,980
that they are completely purposeless

295
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,120
their original intent was to teach

296
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,410
people how to do things no one ever

297
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,600
looks at patents just just a quick poll

298
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,790
anyone knows anyone here whose whose

299
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,380
company is actually ever said to an

300
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,420
engineer yes you should look at patent

301
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,670
so that we can discover this interesting

302
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,460
new thing we can do anyone yes what I

303
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,090
said really they ask you to look at

304
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,680
patterns I'm sorry where do you work I'm

305
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,850
just very curious in a coding villain

306
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,980
and and they they asked you to look the

307
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,060
Psalter they've asked my god you guys

308
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,880
are not gonna be in business long okay

309
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,110
sorry yes

310
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,080
Oh University our universities don't

311
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,140
count that crazy they I mean they they

312
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,740
see patterns as a profit center that I

313
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,730
mean oh sure and they almost certainly

314
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,070
want a file so they can sue other people

315
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,470
I mean universities he's not quite a

316
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,420
non-practicing entity but but pretty

317
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,210
damn close but I'm very surprised you

318
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,710
are the only software company I've ever

319
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,750
heard of who's done that and good luck

320
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,540
to you everyone else everyone else at

321
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,140
least in the u.s. is paranoid Lee warned

322
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,690
never ever look at this you will be in

323
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,760
severe danger the triple damages etc are

324
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,460
gonna kill you if you do this so alright

325
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,630
so how did the gplv3 patent provisions

326
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,030
Kostis in samba

327
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,150
well so Bradley told me an interesting

328
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,140
story

329
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,700
I knew the Apple were involved in gplv3

330
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,760
drafting I knew they objected to the

331
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,290
patent clause but I didn't know exactly

332
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,230
how apparently what they would do is say

333
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,090
we object to these clauses and then when

334
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,800
the FSF came back to them said okay

335
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,150
what's wrong with the wording what would

336
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,680
you like is to change how would you like

337
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,610
it to be corrected they never replied

338
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,500
so they'd you said yes we object to this

339
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,060
well how do you object to it well we

340
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,900
object to it it's bad so what they ended

341
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,330
up doing was they pulled samba and in

342
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,100
fact they're slowly but surely pulling

343
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,980
most GPL software v2 or v3 it doesn't

344
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,040
really matter for them they've created a

345
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,180
proprietor smb2 server and remove Samba

346
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,350
for Mac OS X they're the only vendor to

347
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,630
publicly say we can't use sambar casis

348
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,460
GPL v3 in practice we probably lost some

349
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,890
other vendors I'll go into that a little

350
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,360
bit more later on I can't remember this

351
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,060
next slide enough because for a fedora

352
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,380
doesn't have the Open Office that allows

353
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,030
me to see the next slide in advance so

354
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,830
it's just and what you miss treating me

355
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,280
as you what I wrote but I do go into it

356
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,770
further so yeah that was that was

357
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,350
discouraging we probably lost some code

358
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,510
contributions but not that much

359
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,220
most of the Apple code contributions

360
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,390
were actually fixing samba to work on

361
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,280
Mac OS so yeah so here's an interesting

362
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,670
thing the the confluence of two things

363
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,270
Samba moving to GPL v3 and Microsoft

364
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,390
losing the EU antitrust case and then

365
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,609
being forced to publish their protocols

366
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,609
which they did ended up doing

367
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,369
wholeheartedly and much more fully than

368
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,990
the EU originally demanded the you

369
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,300
demanded a certain set they finally when

370
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,040
you know what this is actually good for

371
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,770
us and they published everything so the

372
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,900
confluence of that created a market for

373
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,640
alternative Samba and there were

374
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,090
actually two

375
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,390
that got created while two or three now

376
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,130
this there's a couple more they they

377
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,409
keep popping up and and it's interesting

378
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,330
to look at what actually happens to them

379
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,770
they would they would actually advertise

380
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,230
you know yes this is this is all the

381
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,049
good bits of samba but it's not gplv3 in

382
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,520
fact one of them which I found really

383
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,799
amusing was they implemented the

384
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,760
document of parts of SMB 2 and the that

385
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,890
company was actually saying well if you

386
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,539
want to support all the Windows versions

387
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,690
just install sambar as well and when we

388
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,029
get when we get calls that we don't

389
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,950
understand we'll just pass them through

390
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,840
to to the samba piece we judge kind of

391
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,399
defeats the object as far as I can see

392
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,490
there anyway so what happened to these

393
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,630
guys is very interesting one of them got

394
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,909
quite popular and was giving me

395
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,440
headaches at the time I was like oh my

396
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,149
god are we about to be obsolete and they

397
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:45,809
sold licences to a number of our of our

398
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,730
vendors who said yeah you guys are old

399
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,380
where we're going with this new stuff

400
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,649
it's great what actually turned that to

401
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:57,270
happen was EMC had bought them and there

402
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,880
were so many bugs in it that they

403
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,100
weren't critical customer data lost bugs

404
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,230
that they weren't getting fixed that

405
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,470
eventually EMC just said screw it we're

406
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,630
going to buy the company so they bought

407
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,490
the company to get access to the source

408
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,679
code and fixes and have the engineers

409
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,570
work on their fixes and they promptly

410
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,580
terminated all the support contracts of

411
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,370
every other vendor who was using it so

412
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,159
these guys were left completely in the

413
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,070
lurch with unsupportive software with no

414
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,220
bugs bug fixes coming out I I know the

415
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,990
guy who made the decision at EMC and I

416
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,270
sent him an email that just just had one

417
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,860
line that said thank you for ridding me

418
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:43,380
of this turbulent priest and yeah they

419
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,990
many of the the other vendors who were

420
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,620
using that have since readapted Samba

421
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,720
and have been participating quite

422
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,750
actively simply because I think they've

423
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:00,000
been shown what can happen if they're if

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,159
their supplier gets bought out by a

425
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,500
hostile vendor and so that that was kind

426
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,960
of interesting yes it cost us we I think

427
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,789
we've kind of recovered along there so

428
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,830
so let's go on to the the thing that

429
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,870
really disturbed me more than anything

430
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,179
else so if you familiar with the work of

431
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,100
a wonderful TV writer in the u.s. called

432
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,799
Joss Whedon he writes these great TV

433
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,520
series he'd Firefly Buffy the Vampire

434
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,710
Slayer etc and he came up with this

435
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,830
concept of the big bad and the big bad

436
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,899
is you know you you fight these lesser

437
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,059
enemies your characters fight these

438
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,380
lesser enemies like the Microsoft

439
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,510
novella agreement or you know software

440
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,570
patents or along the way but the end the

441
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,510
end of the season you have the Big Bad

442
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,250
which is the you know the main enemy

443
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,169
that you have to defeat in order for the

444
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,539
TV series to continue and I think the

445
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,399
gplv3 and us the big baddies DRM digital

446
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,049
rights management or digital

447
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,000
restrictions management is the FSF likes

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,169
to call it if you haven't read any of

449
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:06,030
Vernor Vinge ii science fiction books i

450
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,100
really suggest you pick them up there

451
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,070
are a couple that are really relevant

452
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,780
this is a quote from the deepness in the

453
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,250
sky and this should actually make your

454
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,610
blood run cold especially with recent

455
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,340
governments in the u.s. a technological

456
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,580
tyranny is one where government approved

457
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,639
code must be running on every node in

458
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,539
the network with no way to remove it

459
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,159
that's just one executive order away

460
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,090
really and the other book he wrote

461
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,620
that's that's wonderful that addresses

462
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,899
this is what called rainbows end which

463
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,820
again is in a world where drm is

464
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,480
mandatory

465
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,669
he actually explicitly talks about

466
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,520
running the new herd as an illegal act

467
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,230
that one of the characters does at some

468
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,929
point you get you a choice of classic

469
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,450
Windows Mac or Linux so hey it's not all

470
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,980
bad but of course it's running on the

471
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,380
kernel that contains the code by the

472
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,149
Department of Homeland Security which is

473
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:01,980
the only people who can actually access

474
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,399
the hardware and the reason that it's

475
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:09,080
very disturbing to me is you know as

476
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,580
people like to say the computer industry

477
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,770
and drug trap

478
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,860
are the only industries that call their

479
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,890
customers users while DRM actually

480
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,320
downgrade to the user to a renter which

481
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,320
in my mind is even worse you're even

482
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,900
lower and the trend really seems to be

483
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,780
as far as I can see is towards as the

484
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,440
legacy systems of on-premises servers

485
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,830
are going away these you end up with DRM

486
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,080
infested user devices that you can't

487
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,600
change in any way using web api to talk

488
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,030
to computers that you don't own

489
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,540
clouds essentially via hostile Terms of

490
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,100
Service and by hostile Terms of Service

491
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,750
I mean Terms of Service that say

492
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,750
anything you put into that cloud is ours

493
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,360
and you can't take it back out again

494
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,010
obviously Terms of Service where you can

495
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,040
actually get your own data back a better

496
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,750
and these terms of services may may

497
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,760
arbitrarily change so I mean that's the

498
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,940
world that we as engineers appear to be

499
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,730
building for society and I don't think

500
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:26,870
this is a terribly good idea so a few of

501
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,690
the you're missing missing the real

502
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,320
chatty bit at the bottom so so I mean

503
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,300
you know everybody has their own DRM

504
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,540
Horror Story but I mean it's appropriate

505
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,820
that printer manufacturers are one of

506
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,340
them HP Lexmark having self-destructing

507
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,920
ink cartridges that will lie about how

508
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,630
much ink they've got so you can't refill

509
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,880
them tractors and the famous the famous

510
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,470
quote from bog young Bob Young the Red

511
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,210
Hat would you buy a car with the hood

512
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,720
welded shut about the superiority of red

513
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,940
hand open-source software well yes you

514
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,190
are buying cars with the the hood welded

515
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,220
shut because if the third-party repair

516
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,890
shops don't get access to the software

517
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,860
to fix them or to diagnose them then yes

518
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,300
you do have to take it back to the

519
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,700
dealer who can decide to change it and

520
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,250
revoke your license you you're not

521
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,900
buying the tractor you're getting John

522
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,090
Deere claims you receive an implied

523
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,850
license for the life of the vehicle

524
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,720
obviously DRM in media wonderful quote

525
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,260
from my colleague Ian Hickson about the

526
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,630
the reason for the rme media is

527
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,640
essentially not to stop the user copying

528
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,290
stuff because of appearances copied

529
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,330
science all the time it's pretty--it's

530
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,460
to put the control over the makers of

531
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,280
devices that play and the most shameful

532
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,570
thing of course is the w3c standardizing

533
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,070
DRM in in web protocols that is a an act

534
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,280
of vandalism I think that will that will

535
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,880
cause them toll damage going forward so

536
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,080
oh thank you yeah yes that and that

537
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,790
shame on them that is just just

538
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:15,110
outrageous and and yeah terrible so how

539
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,950
does gplv3 help not much really

540
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,630
a little so here's the interesting thing

541
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,390
I know of several products I'm not going

542
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,960
to name them the the requirement of

543
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,460
using code in those products that was

544
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,650
gplv3

545
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,040
caused the companies to default from DRM

546
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,790
closed to be able to open them up to

547
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,480
vendor modification now I'm pretty sure

548
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,910
if they were able to choose alternatives

549
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,480
to that gplv3 software on a different

550
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,150
license or gplv2 or whatever those

551
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,880
devices would be locked down fully DRM

552
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,090
unable to be modified by the user so you

553
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,910
end up with a developer mode switch

554
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,530
simply because factor gplv3 software

555
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,500
exists and he's needed on the device so

556
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,930
you know as a free software advocate and

557
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,680
from a free software perspective gplv2

558
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,610
isn't good enough

559
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,340
he doesn't prevent the lockdown of a

560
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,070
user device and I really don't want

561
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,410
people to have locked them user devices

562
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,800
it's too easy for lawyers at companies

563
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,360
to say wow allowing the user to modify

564
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,940
it's risky let's not do it even though

565
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,220
we're using GPL code let's just lock it

566
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,870
all bound and one of the things that we

567
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,620
can help with

568
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,280
is to try and educate vendors about the

569
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,059
value of having open user communities

570
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,640
and the best examples for this I can see

571
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,850
excuse me are the Reuters the dd-wrt and

572
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,160
others that are fully open because of

573
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,690
the lawsuits brought by I think it was

574
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,740
the FSF in the early days and the other

575
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,280
one is I think this is from the actions

576
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,100
by Conservancy I'm not 100% sure on that

577
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,200
allowing the Samy go TV community where

578
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,600
you actually have a user community that

579
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,040
allows you to replace the firmware on

580
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,260
your TV which is a I mean a great thing

581
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,929
I I haven't done that but so how do we

582
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,270
so so going from the shouty part to try

583
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,590
and be a little more positive if this

584
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,179
was a bit this was what it was supposed

585
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,230
to be about in the first place how do we

586
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,540
in the Samba team actually try and work

587
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,820
with vendors and get them over their

588
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,650
lawyers who were sort of like you know

589
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,780
you're making your removing my

590
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,270
comfortable gplv2 pair of shoes and

591
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,220
making me wear these new hobnail boots I

592
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,410
don't like them this gplv3 stuff so what

593
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,020
we do is obviously we have to find out

594
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,400
about them they have to reach out to us

595
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,410
we have to communicate but when they do

596
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,140
that we try and reach out one of the

597
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,059
first things I will do is offer to have

598
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,970
a conference call or bring Conservancy

599
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,320
lawyers to talk with with their lawyers

600
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,080
about helping them to achieve the goals

601
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,580
that they want by using the software so

602
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,929
you know we'll offer them legal help to

603
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,600
interpret gplv3

604
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,570
I will usually offer them technical help

605
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,240
to help them architect their products

606
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,200
because a lot of these vendors you know

607
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,390
at least for Samba an SMB service than

608
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,670
me to even Active Directory it's a

609
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,400
commodity very easy to get you have the

610
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,570
bike from Microsoft you get it from

611
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,700
motorbike from other vendors it's a very

612
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,400
very mature market there's no reason to

613
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,260
there's no value in having a better than

614
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,000
s and B server than anyone else everyone

615
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,059
has a good enough SMB server

616
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,649
we can use one of the protons we're all

617
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,049
good enough so the value is how do we

618
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,429
help them architect their products if

619
00:28:58,429 --> 00:28:59,659
they really want to keep something

620
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,970
secret if they that's what their

621
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,529
commercial value is that they want to

622
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:07,279
have how can they achieve that while

623
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,720
still using Samba because they've got I

624
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,100
would prefer that they would use Sam

625
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,049
because having them in my community

626
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,200
makes my community better than having

627
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,970
them use fully proprietary software all

628
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,330
the way down so I have actually helped

629
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,850
and we have actually make changes inside

630
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,129
samba I know this is kind of heresy in a

631
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:26,929
free software conference we've actually

632
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,259
changed things to make it easier for

633
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,309
proprietary vendors to keep code

634
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,429
proprietary if it helps make Samba

635
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:36,799
better and helps us structure our code

636
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
better I don't think it's a terrible

637
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,820
thing to actually do that and help both

638
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,460
of us and the other thing is the the day

639
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,830
of the the amateur programmer turning up

640
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,019
and doing something like Samba is is

641
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,840
it's kind of where we do get some

642
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,940
amateur help but it's much less than we

643
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,850
used to when we first started although

644
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,009
we do we do try and grow our programmer

645
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,470
community that way the practical fact is

646
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,990
a lot of the programmer community now

647
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,480
who work on samba they are paid to do so

648
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,820
and they are working for vendors who are

649
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,619
using samba in ever more complicated

650
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:20,990
products so how do we try and achieve

651
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,679
this well firstly I try and get past the

652
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:26,869
helpdesk and the legal staff and the

653
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,639
management and I try and get a

654
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,470
relationship going directly with the

655
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,110
engineers because most engineers even

656
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,210
people working for companies that create

657
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,730
lockdown DRM infested products don't

658
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,190
want to create lockdown DRM in festive

659
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,559
products because their engineers too and

660
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,289
they don't like you know the effect

661
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:47,539
creating a lockdown Ruta they don't like

662
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,340
the fact that if they had to buy a root

663
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,299
or they don't want it to be locked down

664
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,279
either they want it to work and they

665
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,389
want to be able to fix it so try and get

666
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,799
to the engineers try and work with the

667
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:02,509
engineers try and get to them early the

668
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:04,490
worst thing that can happen is someone

669
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,869
to come to you and we have had this

670
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:06,980
happen

671
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,560
basically say oh I have this product

672
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,450
with sambar in it isn't it great

673
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,640
I want to work with you now and you look

674
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,960
at what they've done they're basically

675
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,060
linked proprietary things directly in

676
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,140
your like ah great it's hard to get them

677
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,440
to redesign at that point what we'll do

678
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,920
in that case is will not normally invoke

679
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,980
GPL violations on them will work with

680
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,610
them will say look right now you have

681
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,470
what you have but this is how you really

682
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,270
need to change this code to be GPL

683
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,160
compliant and we'll help them do that

684
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,320
and then of course we encourage them to

685
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,660
upstream their code changes and what we

686
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,520
have actually a great success rate with

687
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,790
that we are very upfront with them about

688
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,740
what they can do and what we'd like them

689
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,280
to do in order to make Samba better and

690
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,260
if they want a design thing that's

691
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,330
convenient for them and it also makes

692
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,420
Samba better then I'm happy to help and

693
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,240
I in fact I put a priority on reviewing

694
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,340
their code and helping it get upstream

695
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,870
in fact I'm although I I code a lot a

696
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,000
lot of what I'm doing these days is

697
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,220
reviewing other people's code changes to

698
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,650
Samba to essentially keep them happy and

699
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,150
contributing because I'm getting more

700
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,100
out of that than I can sit and write in

701
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,379
a day so

702
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,740
how can you make the hobnailed boots of

703
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,850
the gplv3

704
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:42,810
work for your vendors so don't try and

705
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,000
compromise so far that you're

706
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,170
essentially giving away everything and I

707
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,580
think Bradley is gonna touch on this in

708
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,690
his talk later on in his keynote so I'm

709
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,820
looking forward to that essentially you

710
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,740
have to stand up loud and proud and you

711
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,090
say I'm a free software developer I

712
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,980
don't like the RM and don't down like

713
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,080
the lockdown stuff I don't really want

714
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,420
to help you do that I will help you use

715
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,060
my code I will help you integrate it

716
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,860
with your proprietary stuff but I'm not

717
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,510
going to help you violate the very

718
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,820
principles that made me create this code

719
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,800
in the first place I don't want lockdown

720
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,320
environments and I want to be able to

721
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,900
change stuff let me let me help you

722
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,520
create a product that does what you need

723
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,230
and we'll still do that and it's

724
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,410
possible you can have DRM lockdown

725
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,270
devices that can be as I've mentioned

726
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,220
before that can be flipped with a switch

727
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,800
into a developer mode and at that point

728
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,170
you don't necessarily have to support it

729
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,880
you don't have to support the software

730
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,830
anymore you can restrict what it can do

731
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,440
on the network etc the gplv3 allows for

732
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,710
all these things most to my

733
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,090
understanding most corporate lawyers

734
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,890
haven't read it other than the factors

735
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,050
wow this is much longer than v2 it's

736
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,060
more complex why don't we just stick

737
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,140
with v2 stuff so don't be too judgmental

738
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,470
if you are working with Hollywood then

739
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,010
DRM is if you want access to that that

740
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,380
that content then you're gonna have DRM

741
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,600
so be prepared to set people had to say

742
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,080
okay you guys go buy someone else's SMB

743
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,389
server or whatever you you just can't

744
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:20,610
use that stuff that's fine you know just

745
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,650
be prepared to walk away that which is

746
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,650
always good in any negotiation and the

747
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,580
other thing is as many people have said

748
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,280
here it's very rare that violators are

749
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,830
malicious yeah occasionally and kind of

750
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,699
will know who they are where they are

751
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,389
but most most violators are just

752
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,949
clueless

753
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,510
my my my favorite one is an audio

754
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,080
manufacturer who no source are offering

755
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,670
any of their products or whatever and

756
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,679
they actually advertise as a selling

757
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,900
point we have a custom Linux current

758
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,480
based product I mean that that kind of

759
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
disconnect is just gross stupidity

760
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,900
that's not those guys they're not they

761
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,120
want to make nice audio they don't they

762
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,590
don't really you know somebody gave them

763
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,940
some software they put it in their

764
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,890
advertising at the best I know how those

765
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,930
guys are not trying to rip people off

766
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,820
they're just dumb so be nice to them

767
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,530
be nice to them okay so all the things

768
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,560
that we've learned over the years

769
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,590
distribute your copyright ownership we

770
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,860
have always preferred individual

771
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,590
copyrights to corporate copyright and

772
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,690
that's an interesting case it works on -

773
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,190
that kind of works on two levels one

774
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,460
sometimes corporations like that and

775
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,540
originally our first contributions from

776
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,420
Microsoft I think came about because

777
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,020
they thought I don't I'm not a lawyer so

778
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,460
I don't know whether this is true or not

779
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,710
but they considered that they might be

780
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,740
able to get people to work on samba

781
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,840
under personal copyright which would

782
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,160
prevent exposing microsoft owned patents

783
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,690
because the people who were doing it

784
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,190
were giving his personal copyright and

785
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,600
not Microsoft copyright

786
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,750
maybe the other thing that smearing out

787
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,930
the copyright does is it avoids

788
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,530
corporate capture now the Linux kernel I

789
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,600
think it's pretty close to being

790
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,840
completely corporate owned and once

791
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,390
that's happened you know you see the

792
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,780
fuss that happens when essentially

793
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,030
corporate developers who are completely

794
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,130
tied to their employer don't want to see

795
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,050
any enforcement because it's going to

796
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,110
damage their job you don't really get

797
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,580
much real enforcement in that case so

798
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,590
the other thing that gplv3 allowed us to

799
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,170
do is it allowed us to open up a little

800
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,870
bit and allow some corporate copyright

801
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,210
we do that now we will allow

802
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,130
we have a certificate of ownership you

803
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,050
send in once you've done that from a

804
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,060
corporate email address we will accept

805
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,490
corporate copyright coming in one of the

806
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,520
reasons for that it's actually an

807
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,600
interesting I'll do it very briefly

808
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,890
essentially in the early days of Samba

809
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,680
fridge and I found out about a vendor

810
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,200
who was violating the GPL by accident

811
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,760
they had in they had bought a company

812
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,370
that was selling an SMB server that they

813
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,040
had taken samba put it inside a bsd

814
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,900
kernel link the whole thing together and

815
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,370
shipped it and there was stuck it's like

816
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,780
well we're gonna ship this product in

817
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,700
three weeks what do we do the new owners

818
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,060
had realized that this was a disaster so

819
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,920
tricky and I essentially because we were

820
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,750
such majority copyright holders it

821
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,180
wasn't owned by a corporation we were

822
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,520
able to say to them ok we'll allow you

823
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,400
to do this and the next release do it

824
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,550
right which they did and a third party

825
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,350
who if you remain nameless who was

826
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,160
paying for work in Samba tried to assert

827
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,400
corporate ownership over this and the

828
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,770
reason that they gave for doing that was

829
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,680
that they wanted to be able to sue other

830
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,290
companies essentially that the Red Hat

831
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,030
what Richard was talking about at Red

832
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,590
Hat they wanted to be able to counter

833
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,600
sue somebody to stop them from

834
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,040
distributing a product so having large

835
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,000
amounts of corporate ownership

836
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,370
essentially takes those decisions out of

837
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,260
the hands of the individual developer

838
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,940
and I have a great faith in the

839
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,250
individual free software developer

840
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,300
most of them except for someone in via

841
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,950
Richard already talked about seem to be

842
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:46,350
very reasonable people so using it to

843
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:51,050
expand your community most users

844
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,530
understand why DRM is bad but they don't

845
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,960
really understand what alternatives that

846
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,410
they have most users go for convenience

847
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,960
and they're kind of like wow you know it

848
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,530
may be DRM but it's very easy to use so

849
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,370
you need to educate and this is this is

850
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,830
why we try and explain to our users why

851
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,770
we use gplv3 obviously we can only talk

852
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,630
to the users on our mailing list you

853
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,000
were a complicated product so you need a

854
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,160
lot of most people using sambar in a

855
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,600
complicated way need to have some

856
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,920
interaction with this in order to use

857
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,700
excessively the guys who just by someone

858
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,080
else's nows don't really do that but we

859
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,810
if someone does buy an ass and they say

860
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,220
honey I want to be able to modify this

861
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,010
software you know that for some reason

862
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,120
it's not working for them they want to

863
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,710
change it at least we're at that point

864
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,630
we're able to explain able to explain to

865
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,770
them yes

866
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,950
it's because we chose this license that

867
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,130
we were able to give you the freedom to

868
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,740
modify this stuff if we were still on

869
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,320
gplv2 yeah we could give you the source

870
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,270
code but good look on changing it on

871
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,340
your box there's nothing you can do and

872
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,770
and we have no redress or way of

873
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,490
changing that whatsoever you know

874
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,540
obviously try not to be too judgmental

875
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,100
there's open source developers who

876
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
basically especially in the Linux kernel

877
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,030
who seem to have come to the conclusion

878
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,550
that the GPO was a bad idea and don't

879
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,010
really want to support it anymore Greg

880
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:28,100
Hartmann you think who when asked what

881
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,990
when would you actually enforce it

882
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,160
couldn't come up with a very good answer

883
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,720
to that and the other thing I like to

884
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,340
point out is that a gplv3 developer is

885
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,500
just a gplv2 developer who came across a

886
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,250
lockdown device just just like it you

887
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,020
know conservative as a liberal who got

888
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,220
mugged you know eventually gplv2 only

889
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,960
zealots are gonna run into an

890
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,240
ever-shrinking world of devices that

891
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,250
they can do anything with outside of

892
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,470
their employers and I don't think

893
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,820
they're gonna like the world that

894
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,580
they're helping to make right now so be

895
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,660
nice to them

896
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,330
when when they change their mind that

897
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,090
kind of I kind of screwed up it was it

898
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,110
was better one when run off my laptop so

899
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,000
how does gplv3 make the world a better

900
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
place how can you use it to make the

901
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,640
world a better place so so the

902
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,530
if you take away one point from this

903
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,740
talk I hope you realize that judicious

904
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,370
creation of just small amounts of gplv3

905
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,970
software can have a big effect on the

906
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,710
vendor ecosystem if those pieces of

907
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,650
software are critical enough important

908
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,950
enough they can lever they can they can

909
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,210
be the amp that moves the rubber tree

910
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,730
plant they can force things in the

911
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,790
positive direction and is John Sullivan

912
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:57,950
here so FSF why is G Lib C not L gplv3

913
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,160
yes I'm talking to you he knew about you

914
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,480
know I was gonna shout about this I told

915
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,080
him yesterday so your flagship license

916
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,510
all of your software needs to be under

917
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,200
this it is ridiculous that G Lib C is

918
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,410
still under v2 only I know why they did

919
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,450
it they're frightened they're frightened

920
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,810
of what's happening to GCC with c-line

921
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,670
they're frying to be happening to G Lib

922
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:29,460
C there and my my my comment to them is

923
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,150
that's gonna happen anyway the people

924
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,070
who don't like GPL who created C line

925
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,840
they're gonna do that to G Lib C whether

926
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,120
you realize it or not so why not make

927
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,220
the world a better place and stand up

928
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,870
for the principle that you supposed to

929
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:50,730
believe in alright and with that bit of

930
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,310
shouting and I noticed John didn't turn

931
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,200
up I don't know whether slides are gonna

932
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,910
be but wherever they are I'll put them

933
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,040
so I will be linked to the frustum

934
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,930
website page for your talks thank you

935
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,280
for very much Jeremy we have time for

936
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,370
maybe one or two more questions first in

937
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:12,680
that view okay thank you for your talk

938
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,850
just real quick question on our

939
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,660
corporate capture yeah can you mention a

940
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,800
few projects that you think are

941
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,710
vulnerable to this and in addition do

942
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,990
you think that this corporate action the

943
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,190
corporate capture term can apply for non

944
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,540
relicensing sort of conditions so for

945
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,370
example if you have a large foundation

946
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,810
which has a lot of control even if it's

947
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,730
not going to have the entire copyright

948
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,290
owner

949
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:43,860
um so I mean what corporate capture can

950
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,820
happen in many ways but what I really

951
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,680
mean by corporate capture is the

952
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,020
decisions on the project being taken out

953
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,360
of the hands of the developers so I

954
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,070
don't necessarily mean all the copyright

955
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,970
owned by corporations or the technical

956
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,980
decisions can still be left to

957
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,120
developers but if essentially the

958
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,250
direction of the project and how it runs

959
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,090
and what it does is out not under the

960
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,010
control of the people who wrote it

961
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,260
that's essentially the thing I'm trying

962
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,930
to argue against olynyk's is definitely

963
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,990
one of them I mean that's I'm not sure I

964
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,660
could name other projects straight off

965
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,200
the bat I Sam as Sam is not one of them

966
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,370
we actually have a very diverse

967
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,770
community of people who hate each other

968
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,490
mostly agree on anything

969
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,160
we actually had we actually had to go to

970
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,440
oh that's really one more question yeah

971
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,240
okay so I have a question about one

972
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,450
point not a glass at all which is when

973
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,120
we have a system where we have safety

974
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,060
issues and so my team is working in the

975
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,210
automotive sector in fact inside

976
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,530
automotive great Linux which is for the

977
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,020
open project but we still cannot use

978
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,180
deeper v3 because this is going to taint

979
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,360
the food system of the car and I think

980
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,770
most of the people will understand that

981
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,050
we cannot open as a software of the car

982
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,370
like we can open the software of a rotor

983
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,560
so as today so as today we've been

984
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,810
asking the question on how if we could

985
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,540
implement a car with a secure boot where

986
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,920
we could protect the software the

987
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,020
critical software and have other

988
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,150
software running gplv3 that people could

989
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,880
change which is today not possible so

990
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,510
the end result is all the project I'm

991
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,960
aware of and any other critical project

992
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,520
like in the industry because we don't

993
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,170
know how to address you can absolutely

994
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,860
do that so long as you don't use if if

995
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,870
you have a system that you think is so

996
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,290
critical that nobody should change it

997
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,880
then absolutely you can't be using gplv3

998
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,880
but if you look up one of the accidents

999
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,160
happened in automotive software Tesla

1000
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,430
has essentially had accidents none of

1001
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,920
that software is free software in any

1002
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,180
kind so just by saying I won't use gplv3

1003
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,490
isn't going to protect you from the

1004
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,720
lawsuits okay you have to a thank you so

1005
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,169
much Jeremy

1006
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,769
