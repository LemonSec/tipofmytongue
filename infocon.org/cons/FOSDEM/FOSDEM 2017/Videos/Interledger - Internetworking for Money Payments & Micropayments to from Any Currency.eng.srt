1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,010
okay Evan Schwartz will talk us about

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:15,020
inter later so that when you want all

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,930
right so thank you all for coming

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,119
my name is Evan Schwartz I'm an engineer

5
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,800
at a company called ripple that does

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,900
payments and I'm a co-inventor of inter

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,580
ledger so I'm going to be talking about

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,710
internet working for money and I'm gonna

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,360
turn the lights off so that you can see

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,280
these dark slides better I think this is

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,870
the right one hopefully the room doesn't

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,489
blow up okay so in this presentation I'm

13
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,730
gonna talk through why payments need

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,940
internetworking

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,380
and a little bit of what what exactly

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,630
we're talking about there how inter

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,850
ledger works and then present a specific

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,440
use case which is web micro payments so

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,660
payments today are broken this is what

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,420
it looks like this is an actual

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,860
Starbucks in Turkey where they have

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,719
something like eight different payment

23
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,820
card terminals because none of them work

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,860
with one another each of the banks has

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,500
an exclusive license with one of the

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,329
card networks so you need eight

27
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:09,829
different terminals in order to accept

28
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,840
payments this is crazy

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,759
but this is actually pretty similar to

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,859
what it looks like online where if how

31
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,329
many people have ever tried to accept

32
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,409
payments online and fair number it's a

33
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,389
pain you have tons of different options

34
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,009
this is an actual website and this is

35
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,799
something like I don't know 30 different

36
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,659
payment methods that they accept and

37
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,549
again the reason is that none of them

38
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,670
work with one another so the root the

39
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,649
problem basically comes down to the

40
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,899
world is never going to agree on one

41
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,439
payment network it's not about finding a

42
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,329
better one it's not about you know

43
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,969
making a new new one the world just

44
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,619
won't agree there's always going to be

45
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,090
lots and lots of different payment

46
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,340
networks so what do we do well the

47
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,899
problem here is that all of these

48
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,479
networks are disconnected so today if I

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,939
today payments work pretty well if you

50
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,069
want to stay within one network if I

51
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,899
have PayPal and you have PayPal works

52
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,119
fine if I have visa and you accept Visa

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,119
it works great SEPA same thing bitcoins

54
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,190
same thing all of these networks work

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,620
well if you're just sending within the

56
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,240
network but as soon as you want to try

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,890
as soon as you want to send money to

58
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,930
someone else on a different network it

59
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,230
completely breaks down so this is

60
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,180
actually surprisingly similar to the

61
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,609
problem that the internet originally was

62
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,530
solving which was that you had all these

63
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,909
different information network

64
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,189
technologies and they were all

65
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,959
disconnected and so what the internet

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,189
was about was internet working so that's

67
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,750
obviously where the name comes from so

68
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,670
internet working is being able to tie

69
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,219
together independent networks to kind of

70
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,299
make a bigger one so the question how do

71
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,840
we fix payments well the answer is we

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,480
need internet working for money then I'm

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,040
going to talk a little bit about what

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,739
that looks like

75
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,419
so inter ledger is a protocol open

76
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,609
protocol for connecting different types

77
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,379
of payment systems whether they are

78
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,109
blocked chains banks digital wallets

79
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:10,519
mobile money networks etc so in order to

80
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,169
do internet working you basically need

81
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,269
four key ingredients I'm going to go

82
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,919
through each of them in turn so the

83
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,019
first one is routers this is basically

84
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,319
from the how the internet works we call

85
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,750
them in this system connectors so what

86
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,579
this picture shows is you have a sender

87
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,199
on the left and a receiver on the right

88
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,449
the sender's on a euro denominated

89
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,000
ledger or payment network and the

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,889
receivers on a US dollar denominated

91
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,560
ledger and so what you need is some

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,150
party in the middle that we've referred

93
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,010
to as a connector that's basically going

94
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,530
to accept money on one side and payout

95
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,849
on the other side

96
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,900
pretty simple connectors also exchange

97
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,239
currencies so a connector can set any

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,859
rate they want I'll get into that a

99
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,829
little bit later but they'll take in a

100
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,720
certain amount of euros on the on the

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,419
right or sorry on the left payout in

102
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,199
dollars on the other side so one issue

103
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,609
that you might point out what this is

104
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,739
that bilateral connections don't scale

105
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,419
the obviously the number of connections

106
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,979
you need if you're trying to tie

107
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,989
together different networks increases

108
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,030
very rapidly to the point where it's

109
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,630
infeasible so networks do scale if you

110
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,339
don't need full connectivity if you

111
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,858
don't need a direct connection between

112
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,199
every possible network we know that

113
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,599
scales so if there isn't a direct

114
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,260
connection you basically need multi hop

115
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,920
so that's the second ingredient for this

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,220
so doing multi hop transfers with money

117
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,890
is quite a bit trickier than doing it

118
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,840
with information well on the internet if

119
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,060
a packet drops that's kind of okay with

120
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
money that's not ideal because that

121
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,190
basically means that somebody's lost

122
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,130
money so this is how the world works

123
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,060
today there's a system called

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,570
correspondent banking which is how most

125
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,390
especially core especially international

126
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,740
transfers move and especially larger

127
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,560
volumes and so each of these boxes just

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,420
represents a bank and what happens when

129
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,610
you do a wire transfer is you tell your

130
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,830
bank to send this money and they just

131
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,620
basically do a blind handoff to the next

132
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,600
bank where they send it on and kind of

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,180
hope that it gets to the other side but

134
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
sometimes it doesn't and one of the

135
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,420
things that we've heard from a number of

136
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,690
our customers is that something like 5%

137
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,090
of wire transfers just get lost which is

138
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,670
kind of crazy that this system that

139
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,710
underpins international payments is 5%

140
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,800
of transfers just disappear and so we

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
heard one one story where someone was

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,790
applying for a job with us and he had

143
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,190
gone to start a company in Singapore and

144
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,800
had wired 15,000 pounds from the UK to

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,440
Singapore and a couple weeks after he

146
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,500
had sent the money money didn't show up

147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,450
she called up the bank to say excuse me

148
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,790
where's where's the money and they said

149
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,500
so we don't actually know where the

150
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,470
money is but if you pay us 40 pounds

151
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,450
we'll start an investigation and find

152
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,450
out where the money is and so that's how

153
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,800
payments work today where you have this

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,020
kind of this blind handoff so in order

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,480
to do secure payments and secure

156
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,280
internet working with payments you need

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,610
a better system so yeah this is what

158
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,530
happens if if one of the hops fails

159
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,800
today money gets lost so what you need

160
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
is a basically a two-phase commit and so

161
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,060
this is this was simultaneously

162
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,430
developed both by us working on inter

163
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,230
ledger as well as the Bitcoin lightning

164
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,460
Network if you're familiar with this

165
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,700
same exact kind of flow so you prepare a

166
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,670
payment in in one phase where everyone

167
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,500
just puts money on hold no money

168
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
actually moves and then you have a

169
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,430
second phase where the the payment is

170
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,960
actually executed and there's a

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,050
cryptographic canoe

172
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,120
part of it which is what triggers it but

173
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,740
I won't go into too much detail with

174
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,129
that so what this what this alternative

175
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,169
protocol gives you is that this means

176
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,810
that the sender has a guarantee that

177
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,849
they either the money will arrive at the

178
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,069
recipients account or they'll

179
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,539
automatically get their money back and

180
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,909
so you get proof that the money got

181
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,120
there so that's the the second component

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,759
is mult multi hop transfers the third

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,650
component is an address and packet

184
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,139
format so if you want to understand

185
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,449
inter ledger in one slide it's basically

186
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,300
this there's an address format that is I

187
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,219
would like to get this money over there

188
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,819
and there's an amount and this is all

189
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,229
encapsulated in a packet again this is

190
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,789
very similar to how the internet works

191
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,800
where the the core building blocks of

192
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,440
the Internet are the Internet address

193
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,770
and or IP address and the packet format

194
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,110
so this is this is inter ledger so the

195
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,569
address is a hierarchical identifier

196
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,330
that can identify ledger sub ledger

197
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,270
accounts things like that I can answer

198
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,919
more questions about exactly what the

199
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,849
address contains later the fourth

200
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,279
component kind of racing through this to

201
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,259
try to get through but the fourth

202
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,909
component are the routing protocols so

203
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,529
not gonna go into too much detail here

204
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:04,180
this is just an example of one of the

205
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,909
routing protocol broadcasts basically

206
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,490
what it is is routing the the routers or

207
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,740
connectors broadcast their rates to one

208
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,629
another so that they can populate local

209
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,729
routing tables again very similar to how

210
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,949
the internet works you can kind of think

211
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,259
of this as BGP but for money which is

212
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,719
crazy that there is such a parallel but

213
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,529
this is what we work on so I've

214
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,120
mentioned a number of times that we've

215
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,650
we've taken a lot of inspiration from

216
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,539
the Internet and as we've gone along

217
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,760
with this project the the whole thing

218
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
has turned out to be much more similar

219
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,839
to the Internet than we had ever really

220
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,969
imagined to the point we're at at one

221
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,130
point one of my colleagues did a cop

222
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,970
search and replace on the ipv4 RFC and

223
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,130
kind of replaced data with money and

224
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,640
most of the sentences just worked which

225
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,610
astonished me so taking a lot of

226
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,110
inspiration from the history and the

227
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,820
architecture of the Internet so

228
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,550
familiar diagram to most to many of you

229
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,310
here I'm sure so the Internet's has this

230
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,110
layered approach where at the bottom

231
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,430
layer you have different networking

232
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,350
technologies this is your Wi-Fi

233
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,420
Bluetooth Ethernet on top of that you

234
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,550
have a very simple Internet Protocol

235
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,620
layer which is just about addressing and

236
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,110
not eat not even routing actually and

237
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,519
then on top of that you have all of your

238
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,320
applications specific protocols build

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,510
this is the inter ledger architecture

240
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,300
looks very similar where at the bottom

241
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,920
layer you basically have all of these

242
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,620
different ledger technologies or payment

243
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,839
network technologies and then on top of

244
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,790
that you have this very very simple

245
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,490
inter ledger layer which is just about

246
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,290
addressing and having this packet that

247
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,149
kind of goes across all of these

248
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,800
different ones and then on top of that

249
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,660
you can build a lot of application

250
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,420
specific things some of the ones listed

251
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,120
there are building micro payments into

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,750
HTTP or into torrents or the SPSP is a

253
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,660
simple payment setup protocol so so this

254
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,360
is inter ledger and I'm going to give a

255
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,970
quick demo of what what the experience

256
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,310
looks like so it's kind of hard to see

257
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,040
on a relatively small screen but what I

258
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,709
what I have here is a simple simple

259
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,319
payment network that's running what we

260
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,230
call ILP kit and so the normal payment

261
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,230
experience when you go to any your

262
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,670
PayPal or whatever kind of digital

263
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,319
wallet you have the normal experiences

264
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,899
you can like type in a recipient you can

265
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,740
send them some money and send goes

266
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,000
through nothing special

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,910
so what inter ledger provides is a way

268
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,699
to send across different networks and so

269
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,420
what I'm going to do now is send to an

270
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,670
account on a different ledger and so

271
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,319
this is a higher level protocol built on

272
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:44,050
top of intra ledger so I'm sending to an

273
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,449
account at this this other kit

274
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,639
completely independent could be this

275
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,949
could be denominated in a totally

276
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,449
different currency in this case my

277
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,160
ledger is in Euros this one is in

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,769
dollars so I'm going to send just a tiny

279
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,529
little payment because otherwise my

280
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,540
friend is going to come and actually ask

281
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,370
me for the money so I'm going to send it

282
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,269
and if you can see here I'm sending one

283
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,860
they're going to receive one cent and I

284
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,329
paid two cents in Euros

285
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,629
that kind of covers those fees so that's

286
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,629
quick demo of inter ledger and now I

287
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,540
just want to give one kind of one taste

288
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,910
of what this type of open payment

289
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,600
protocol can do so today the fact that

290
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,910
payments are so broken I would argue is

291
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,999
breaking the web as well this is a great

292
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,429
quote from CEO of Apple that when an

293
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,199
online service is free you're not the

294
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,699
customer you're the product everybody

295
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,769
here obviously very familiar with all of

296
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,389
these services that exist on just

297
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:44,600
sucking up loads and loads of data one

298
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,699
of the reasons why it's so difficult for

299
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,369
any kind of service to not be a data

300
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,989
service or an advertising company is

301
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:52,850
because it's very difficult to pay

302
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,699
online people are probably familiar with

303
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,799
the very annoying Wikipedia banner ads

304
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,439
that come down and say hey please please

305
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,179
give us money wikipedia is one of the

306
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,980
most used services online and yet they

307
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,259
still have such a hard time raising

308
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,029
money and in part it's because the

309
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,779
payment experience is so difficult as a

310
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,339
result of this there's very few

311
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,649
companies that can actually convince us

312
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:18,049
to take out our credit cards and fill

313
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,269
out some some details so what we end up

314
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,459
with is is a small number of services

315
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,699
that can act as a gatekeeper scheme tons

316
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,470
of money off the top and pay out very

317
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,110
poorly to the actual content creators

318
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,419
and a lot of this some of this has to do

319
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,009
with unwillingness to pay and a lot of

320
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,929
it has to do with just it's very

321
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,199
annoying and insecure to put it put to

322
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,759
put your credit card information into

323
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,829
just some website and so if you had this

324
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,929
open payment protocol which is what

325
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,540
we're what we work on what it would

326
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,639
enable is kind of direct payments from

327
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,269
you to the content creator on the on or

328
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,509
an individual website so a lot of

329
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,819
peer-to-peer models are suffering from

330
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,610
the lack of an easy way to pay and a lot

331
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,769
of some now are kind of building in

332
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,230
special tokens in the especially in the

333
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,360
blockchain space but the problem you're

334
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,799
running into is the same one where

335
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,419
everyone needs to be on the same network

336
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,639
so in orders in order to support this

337
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,519
kind of decentralized web one of the

338
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,290
things that you need is a payment

339
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,179
protocol that's neutral that's not tied

340
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:23,299
to a specific network so in conclusion

341
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,160
this is inter ledger

342
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,290
Internet this provides internet working

343
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,079
for money which increases connectivity

344
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,220
and competition it it can lower the cost

345
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,440
of actually doing payments to the point

346
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,029
where it can enable totally new use

347
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,529
cases this is one of the great things

348
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,829
that we saw with the internet and some

349
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,720
key facts about the project it this is

350
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,370
an open protocol that anybody can use

351
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,290
we're in the process of starting a

352
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,029
non-profit foundation to own all of the

353
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,480
IP the code is you can find online on

354
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,029
github it most of it is apache 2

355
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,399
licensed we're working on it as part of

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,430
a w3c community group which has 220 is

357
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,790
actually 230 members now ranging from

358
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,129
banks to central banks to payment

359
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,540
companies to blockchain startups etc and

360
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,060
so yeah come help us connect the world's

361
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,779
ledgers I may have time for one or two

362
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,339
questions but I'm not sure so thank you

363
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:39,320
sorry for speaking so fast as well yes

364
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,000
so the question is is there security

365
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
built into the routing protocols this is

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,210
something that we're working on a lot

367
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,980
one of the things that you saw with the

368
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,420
internet is that the routing protocols

369
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,250
evolved have evolved many many times

370
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,990
since its inception so we're kind of

371
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,060
starting off with something but if

372
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,620
you're interested in in routing and

373
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,150
these types of issues please come get

374
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,100
involved in the project there's tons of

375
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,670
interesting issues like this because you

376
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,650
have a lot of the same issues that come

377
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,380
up with the internet but even more so

378
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,000
and in a kind of tweaked way because

379
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
you're dealing with money so yet the

380
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,780
answer is yes we this is something we're

381
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,600
working on on thinking about a lot but

382
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,380
please come talk to me if you're

383
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,760
interested in hearing more about how it

384
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,400
works good question so the question was

385
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,130
is it part of the w3c web payments group

386
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,460
and one of my colleagues is actually Co

387
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,380
chairing that effort this is not

388
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,660
directly part of that the that effort is

389
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,020
a w3c effort to standardize a payment

390
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,330
API in the browser so this is kind of a

391
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,390
new payment method that we are hoping

392
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,550
will be supported in that but it's it's

393
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,790
a different effort and I've one minute

394
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,520
or okay that's time thank you very much

395
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,770
I will be outside come talk to me if

396
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,499
you'd like a sticker

397
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,559
you
