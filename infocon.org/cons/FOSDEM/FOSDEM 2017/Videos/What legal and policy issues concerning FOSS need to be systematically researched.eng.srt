1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,950
so welcome everyone

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,129
sorry for my bad throat but that's the

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,350
way it is sometimes in the winter season

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,350
so I'm burnin down I'm a researcher in

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,920
this area the force area look up from

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,589
that speaker there I think yeah so

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,689
together with Matias

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,119
he's also researcher and then we have

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,300
two practitioners Andrew Katz and

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,820
fantastic with a lot of experiences in

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,880
this field and in this panel that is

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,700
that we will look into contemporary

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,940
challenges that may inform practice and

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,760
also the other way around in other words

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,200
what are the design of proper and really

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,390
good and useful research surveys so we

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,420
want input and we want to chair first

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,800
the lessons we have learned by a few

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,050
position statements before we open up

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,040
for a discussion that's basically ID and

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,479
you can see the affiliations there and

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,130
the slides will be available northwards

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,430
and the other panelist will introduce

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,050
themselves in connection with their

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,600
position statement of those but first

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,270
andrew will say a few words on the idea

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,550
with the Bama yeah thanks very much bill

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,460
and I feel immensely privileged because

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,950
as a practitioner it's not very often

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
that you get an opportunity to get

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,100
involved in the world of academic

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,040
research into the last couple of years

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,750
I've been working with Bjorn and with

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,190
his colleague Ian s is in the audience

35
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,320
here at the University of hoof than

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,250
Sweden and you know it's been the

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,979
perfect mixture of you know I get all

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,350
the good bits out of doing a khadeem and

39
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,880
none of the bad bits so the good bits

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,159
they pay me I get to research

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,720
interesting things I get to hang out

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,580
with really bright people and gonna talk

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,600
about cool stuff and and I get to avoid

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,979
the bad stuff I don't get involved in

45
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,990
any of the politics and having certain

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,610
to all this you know applications and

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,229
research grants and that sort of thing

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,830
so I feel immensely privileged that I've

49
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,280
been able to do that and during the

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,500
course of the research that we've done a

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,830
few aspects have emerged from

52
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,250
which really makes me think of the the

53
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,930
interface between what I'm doing my

54
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,720
day-to-day life is practicing lawyer and

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,430
what I'm doing in terms of the research

56
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,410
and I think there's you know huge

57
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,710
opportunity for more interrelationship

58
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,440
between those two particular worlds and

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,200
you know what's what I've been impressed

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,300
by is that you know Bjorn and ENS have

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,580
always been looking on the practical

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,410
side as well as the pure academic

63
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,760
research side I mean you know there is

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,050
obviously different definitely a place

65
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,170
for blue sky research but the idea is

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,760
that the the research that we're talking

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,540
about needs to be directed in a in a

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,030
practical and useful manner a way that

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,590
there's actually going to lead to some

70
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,200
sort of results that are making some

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
sort of difference in the outside world

72
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,790
and we're starting to see that already

73
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,990
with some of the research that we've

74
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,460
been doing in terms of you know

75
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,720
standards that we've been able to

76
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,900
demonstrate fulfil criteria in the

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,670
European interoperability framework they

78
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,580
can I specified as open standards and

79
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,690
also there's sort of recent position

80
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,840
paper that was issued by the Swedish

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,070
government there it was a competition

82
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,300
authority wasn't it so you know I think

83
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,470
I think the emphasis is we're not

84
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,150
talking about pure academic research

85
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,880
we're talking about areas in which

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,300
academic rigor academic resources but

87
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,400
can be applied to things that you know

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,250
all of us come across most people in

89
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,170
this room gonna fall into the categories

90
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,480
of developers lawyers or academics or

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,130
some combination of those three and I

92
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,570
think about that's the sort of direction

93
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,209
in which that sort of research needs to

94
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,350
in which we want to direct it okay

95
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,350
thanks Andrew so we go through the four

96
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,480
four of us so I will start then give a

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,240
few thoughts on what we have done as a

98
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,150
position statement

99
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,879
as much as Andrew mentioned we have done

100
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,108
a big study for the Swedish

101
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,000
conversational Authority where we looked

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,488
at in number of projects and in those

103
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,039
projects we see that there is a desire

104
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,740
to to develop system and when they do

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,250
that if you do like public procurement

106
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,949
you sometimes express yourself when you

107
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,780
put requirements in a way which really

108
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,960
inhibits use of us you really need use

109
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,800
of open an open attitude and open

110
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,690
standard so you see a lot of

111
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,080
requirements for specific proprietary

112
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,720
products which definitely exclude for

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,380
solutions

114
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,560
you see specific trademarks which is

115
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
controlled by a single company for

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,760
example and and these kind of things

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,490
when you also refer to standard which is

118
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,370
controlled in a way and govern in a way

119
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,110
which cannot be implemented in force

120
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,530
then you run into problems and and as

121
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,849
part of the research we have was a

122
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,599
commented on the new version the draft

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,400
version of the European interoperability

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,160
framework as for at least the study we

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,020
did for the competition authority it was

126
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,539
published lost autumn and the

127
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,919
director-general for the Swedish

128
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,479
competition authority it was really

129
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,060
concerned and in the forward to that he

130
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,520
really expressed that very clearly and

131
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,639
that's quite unusual for for such such

132
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,580
report that closed down large and

133
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,580
reference to such is problematic I

134
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,800
should say that the focus of that study

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,919
was not false as such but it was on

136
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,260
standard and effect it may have on

137
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,690
competition and when we saw that you

138
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,940
refer to and write requirements in such

139
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,860
a way that you in practice inhibit force

140
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,650
then it's not good for competition so

141
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,900
there is quite a lot of login it's quite

142
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,820
clear in the Swedish field how should

143
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,370
you do how should we go about this well

144
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,460
we have another governmental agency

145
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,780
responsible responsible for building

146
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,050
framework contracts they have designed

147
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,810
framework contracts for adopting force

148
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,820
in the public sector

149
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,400
they started tap more than 10 years ago

150
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
actually it's the

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,189
the country in Europe that has these

152
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,949
kind of contracts and that practice has

153
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,580
helped many agencies to work with this

154
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,539
and now recently when they developed

155
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,960
their most recent framework contract in

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,419
2014 for software and services in

157
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,240
general not only for fosston but they

158
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,009
have a requirement saying that if you

159
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,919
put in a mandatory requirement in a

160
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,569
specification for a project that that

161
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,759
requirement can only refer to standards

162
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,590
which are open standards in order not to

163
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,979
inhibit force that's an effect of that

164
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,020
so it's sort of not 2 K to use that

165
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,020
framework agreement if you refer to

166
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,419
establish which does not conform to this

167
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,909
definition so it's a way of strategic

168
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,849
thinking trying to avoid inhibiting

169
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,550
competition trying to avoid use of all

170
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,830
so you can see it as a passive way of

171
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,479
doing this we have seen that a lot of

172
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,550
management issues in this area is really

173
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,190
problematic we have seen lots of

174
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,469
examples and it's really difficult to

175
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,870
find good examples actually so the loss

176
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,849
quota comes from the English summary of

177
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,610
this report it's a 200 plus page report

178
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,190
for the competition authority we have

179
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,110
presented this in the European

180
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,919
Commission at various meetings and it

181
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,529
it's quite clear that there are few

182
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,409
studies of this kind from different

183
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,449
countries so I think there is a need for

184
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,529
more studies for this so give you one

185
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,990
example of what we have looked at in

186
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,560
another study they have tried to obtain

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,990
clearance on a specific standard which

188
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,800
is an ISO standard we try to contact all

189
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,710
the organizations that control patterns

190
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,319
on a specific standard and as you can

191
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,569
see from this overview slide it was not

192
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,949
so very positive down come first there

193
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,379
are 18 organizations that have declared

194
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,839
that the control patterns on that

195
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,569
specific standard and we were able only

196
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,340
to get

197
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,710
contact with three of them the other

198
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,630
ones we couldn't get access to despite

199
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,799
the fact that they have committed

200
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,950
themselves under the ice I saw

201
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,929
regulations to actually respond there

202
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,960
and the three that we were able to to

203
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,050
get in contact with we were very unlucky

204
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,520
or it was not it was not so easy so we

205
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,800
couldn't clarify this as part of the

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,260
study and in the paper we have quite a

207
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,950
number of examples and quite a number

208
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,690
recommendations that could improve

209
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,820
practice of standardization and that is

210
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,070
something that we have discussed now in

211
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,100
in various contexts it's also clear that

212
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,680
the content of this patent database is

213
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,950
not so it's it is not very high-quality

214
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,620
five of the sixteen organizations we

215
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,330
couldn't even reach and that's another

216
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,920
problem

217
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,050
so that was my short introduction so now

218
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,230
we're two materials thank you

219
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,390
so my name is Mattias Turner from

220
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,250
Switzerland and studying and researching

221
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,950
at University of Bern we are doing

222
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,350
research like I wrote my master thesis

223
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,240
and PhD thesis is about open source

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,910
software research and now I'm still

225
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,860
doing this because I think it's very

226
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,100
interesting just to find out how

227
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,580
communities work and and how also

228
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,950
governance works for example today I

229
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,680
would like to point out one particular

230
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,900
research area we are focusing during the

231
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,730
last two years it's about ICT

232
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,050
procurement of Swiss government agencies

233
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,170
but also any other organization so it's

234
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,140
on which is below the procurement law so

235
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,560
these are all the rail organizations all

236
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,600
the airport's all the electricity power

237
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,690
consult our and plants everything which

238
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,100
is publicly found that is below the

239
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,200
procurement law and so they are obliged

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,990
to actually make public tenders below

241
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,620
the WTO agreement to the government

242
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,450
procurement agreement which is an

243
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,360
international contract between many

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,630
countries about 50 countries which agree

245
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,020
that

246
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,110
he wants to procure publicly their goods

247
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,690
so what we did is actually we crawled

248
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,270
the data of the Swiss national database

249
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,510
it's called co-opt CH it's a better

250
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,880
central platform where every agency

251
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,020
publishes their procurements and we

252
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,500
actually were able to filter the data

253
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,050
for IT procurement or actually ICT

254
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,180
procurements depending on what codes you

255
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,660
use there's a CPV coding schema common

256
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,940
procurement vocabulary so you can filter

257
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,060
out all the IT procurements and then we

258
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,700
actually looked at which of the IT

259
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,600
procurements were really going below and

260
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,270
the public tendering process and which

261
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,020
actually had no bid contracts or direct

262
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,970
awards without any tendering process and

263
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,209
we found out like with the non IT area

264
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,370
there's about like 15% of all the

265
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,839
contracts are awarded without public

266
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,470
tendering and within IT it's about 50 to

267
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,950
60% of all the contracts are without

268
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,190
public tendering so it's a very high

269
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,070
amount of direct awards just to give you

270
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,529
an example for example the Swiss federal

271
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,540
government last year awarded 280 million

272
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,790
Swiss francs so it's about 70 million

273
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,690
euro contract to Oracle without any

274
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,170
public tendering it's just regular

275
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,279
license for adjustment because they were

276
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,709
dependent on Oracle so that's why I

277
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,800
actually I say they are not able to find

278
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,260
any alternative and that's why they give

279
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,380
them 17 million euro contract without

280
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,160
public tendering so this is the one

281
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,990
category we found that there is no

282
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,190
direct there's no open procurement and

283
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,339
then as we all have said there's also a

284
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,650
lot of procurements which say we want to

285
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,760
buy Microsoft licenses who can

286
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,460
first microsoft licenses or who can

287
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,060
offers Adobe licenses or ICP licenses so

288
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,290
it is very product specific and very

289
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,980
targeted so it's not really a

290
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,060
non-functional vendor-neutral

291
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,880
procurement but it's actually very

292
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,920
focused and this is the second category

293
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,480
of products of problems we see the third

294
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,760
problem we see that they say for example

295
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,330
we want to procure a new IT system we

296
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,880
allow open source or that they don't say

297
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,940
what they do but they don't really award

298
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,400
the the special qualities you have with

299
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,650
open source for example that you can

300
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,920
copy it without any restrictions that

301
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,620
you can you look at the source code that

302
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,310
you can contract other companies so they

303
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,990
don't really value the these special

304
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,660
properties of open source software and

305
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,240
the third the fourth problem once they

306
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,540
do actually procure open source in some

307
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,960
or the other way which is good of course

308
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,590
but they forget to actually ask if it's

309
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,620
if the product is is it just supported

310
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,290
or is it used by only one company and

311
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,110
developed does it have a community how

312
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,420
heterogeneous is the community how

313
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,380
activist development and so on so the

314
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,530
these are the four issues we see in

315
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,990
procurement what could be improved for

316
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,930
example one first thing is that agencies

317
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,680
should first of all publicly to open

318
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,500
tendering process and not do direct

319
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,190
Awards second thing is of course don't

320
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,030
specify any products or vendors but only

321
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,930
say what functionality they need a third

322
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,380
point would be to actually say what of

323
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,500
the additional award criterion of open

324
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,690
source software is relevant for

325
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,710
procurement process or

326
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,410
actually and that's what some agencies

327
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,460
now start to do to actually require to

328
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,150
provide the source code for the

329
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,910
development so that the the city of

330
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,490
burden for example they procured a

331
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,940
procurement software and they actually

332
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,370
asked the company who develops the

333
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,950
software to provide it bill as a open

334
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,170
source software and then actually the

335
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,240
city is able to publish the software

336
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,310
below an open-source license again and v

337
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,900
to really measure and also demand

338
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,460
certain quality of the open source

339
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,770
software procured so that there's not a

340
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,730
software like develop I own one company

341
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,890
but it's it's more broadly supported by

342
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,920
companies if you're interested some of

343
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,440
the data or most of the data we publish

344
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,990
on a daily basis especially statistic

345
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,870
dot to see eh it's in German I'm sorry

346
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,900
for them the platform publishes on a

347
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,120
daily basis all the procurements linked

348
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,490
together so if you're interested look at

349
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,050
the night numbers so thank you thanks

350
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,900
Matthias so moving on to something

351
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,140
slightly different one of the papers

352
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,290
that we were smaller areas research we

353
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,380
were looking at an involved analysis of

354
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,950
the contractual documentation that

355
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,150
students in Swedish schools are required

356
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,700
to enter into when they are using the

357
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,510
school's ICT equipment and that also in

358
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,270
many cases involves giving those pupils

359
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,580
access to specific equipment so they

360
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,690
meant maybe lanes laptops for example

361
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,060
those laptops may contain free and open

362
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,890
source software and one of the areas of

363
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,480
research was analyzing the

364
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,670
inconsistencies between the terms on

365
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,940
that the terms contained in the licenses

366
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,950
which the software is licensed under and

367
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,200
the that the contracts that the students

368
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,589
were asked to sign but it became fairly

369
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,290
clear

370
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,689
that really is one corner of a much more

371
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,790
significant problem that I think is

372
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,309
really worthy of further investigation

373
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,930
so clearly we were only looking at this

374
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,360
particular issue as far as Swedish law

375
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,340
is concerned and secondly we were

376
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,460
looking at a fairly narrow use case in

377
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,050
which the students were acquiring

378
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,540
software that was pre loaded onto a

379
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,670
laptop that was lent to them or they

380
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,110
were asked to download software at a

381
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,650
later stage so a fundamental question is

382
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,690
whether that amounts to distribution as

383
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,410
we all know the requirements are

384
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,360
contained in copyleft licenses are

385
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,700
triggered by distribution and it's not

386
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,320
straightforward in many cases to

387
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,990
determine whether distribution has

388
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,429
actually occurred in certain certain

389
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,890
circumstances or not so you can look at

390
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,860
a pretty broad spectrum of this at one

391
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,300
extreme you could say that and as has

392
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,330
been argued in Germany before under

393
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,280
German law Mir in Bell hasn't wrote a

394
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,850
paper on this in 2014 to say that mere

395
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,070
access to the functionality of a piece

396
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,640
of software is amounts to distribution

397
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,620
so that's essentially saying that any

398
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,010
version of the GPL is the a GPL on the

399
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,960
other extreme you could say that if I

400
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,390
load a piece of GPL software on to some

401
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,880
sort of device like a laptop or set-top

402
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,210
box and I lend that to somebody one of

403
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,130
us on a short to a medium term or long

404
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,800
term basis then no distribution takes

405
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,970
place at all so there's really a lot of

406
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,280
scope for analyzing with this this lies

407
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,950
especially in terms of virtualization

408
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,960
it's very interesting question if

409
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,590
somebody instantiates a virtual machine

410
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,970
they load the software into that machine

411
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,380
and then they give somewhere else access

412
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,690
to that machine you know we all have a

413
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,309
gut idea that some sort of distribution

414
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,590
must have taken place but does that

415
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,990
distribution take place at the point

416
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,970
that I give the customer access to the

417
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,130
Machine or does it take effect at the

418
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,830
point where the become the customer gets

419
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,870
access to the root password so I think

420
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,390
that's something that's worthy of

421
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,999
further investigation

422
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,639
those analyses will probably differ from

423
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,489
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from a

424
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,109
practical perspective I spent quite a

425
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,940
lot of time advising project on what is

426
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,070
an appropriate license and clearly

427
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,869
knowledge of what distribution actually

428
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:46,200
means is pretty relevant in terms of

429
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,929
being able to make that distinction and

430
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,549
the one thing that I will not be saying

431
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,379
is distribution means of distribution so

432
00:19:55,379 --> 00:20:00,929
next slide and then moving on to

433
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,269
something completely different so beyond

434
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,019
as already touched on on this particular

435
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,419
issue in terms of the research that we

436
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,049
have done in the context of standards so

437
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,970
what we are suggesting is that when a

438
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,919
project wants to implement a piece of

439
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,009
software that impacts on a standard so

440
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,119
makes use for standards and the

441
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,289
standards essential patents involved as

442
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,999
suggested earlier you know this major

443
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,309
difficulties in terms of those projects

444
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,109
being able to determine where the

445
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:40,019
standard their particular implementation

446
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,749
of it is actually impacting on any

447
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,309
patterns difficulties in terms of

448
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,869
getting hold of appropriate licenses for

449
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,679
those patterns and also a potential

450
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,450
incompatibility between between the

451
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,039
terms of any license that they may

452
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,919
receive and the license of the software

453
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,320
that they're employing particular

454
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,429
difficulty with the freedom or death

455
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,619
clause in the various versions of the

456
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,109
GPL so at the moment in terms of the

457
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,869
specific is if you're looking at

458
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,109
organizations like ISO for example the

459
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:16,349
decorations are recorded in the database

460
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,960
but all of those declarations indicate

461
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,779
is whether a particular organization

462
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,820
first of all claims to have a standard

463
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,580
essential patent and secondly the terms

464
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,289
on which they may or may not be prepared

465
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,960
to license that patent they don't go

466
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,149
into any details in terms of the license

467
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,979
other very broad terms whether it's

468
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:37,440
going to be royalty-free or not for

469
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,139
example and they certainly don't go into

470
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:41,350
any detail in terms of

471
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,410
a license is going to be compatible with

472
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,960
specific licenses or not so one of the

473
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,880
suggestions that we're proposing and

474
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,350
something that also requires further

475
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,100
research is in addition to being able to

476
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,850
specify particular options on the

477
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,700
Declaration database it's possible for

478
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,440
the deck Lauren to actually declare an

479
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,390
actual license on the database itself

480
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:11,799
which is we're calling option 0 so the

481
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,600
first part of this slide is natural type

482
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,299
declaration as it exists at the moment

483
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:19,390
so if a declarant selects that

484
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,100
particular option then it's open for

485
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,510
anyone wanting to implement that

486
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,250
standard in software to approach the

487
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,450
deck Lauren to say can you let me have a

488
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,980
license and then you're into a process

489
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,049
of the declarants either responding or

490
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,730
not then providing a draft license then

491
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,110
you have to analyze the license and find

492
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,760
out where there is compatible etcetera

493
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,450
etcetera etc the second option is our

494
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,220
that the second part of the slide

495
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,210
presents our suggested alternative which

496
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,070
is it would be possible for a

497
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,570
declaration form that yes this is the

498
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,919
license that we're prepared to grant

499
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,230
it's a pretty broad patent license

500
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,350
that's intended to be specific to the

501
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,700
implementation of that particular

502
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,000
standard and it also contains wording

503
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,250
that's fairly familiar to anyone that

504
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,980
has looked at the patent license wording

505
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,190
in licenses like Apache gplv3

506
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,530
and so on so the intention here is that

507
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,320
if this was made an option available to

508
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,740
declarants of standards then it would

509
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,919
really simplify the license Arrangements

510
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,970
significantly in terms of projects

511
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,760
wanting to implement those standards and

512
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,200
you know from the declarants perspective

513
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,640
if they're large organizations that are

514
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,820
used to licensing their software and

515
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,850
licenses such as apache gplv3 then this

516
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,169
is language that will they will be

517
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,679
fairly familiar with in any event so the

518
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,409
research is really intended to establish

519
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:43,059
way that this is a viable option and

520
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,350
whether it would be something that would

521
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,570
help both the standard-setting community

522
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,690
and also any projects that want to

523
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,620
implement those standards

524
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,299
come around to say if you won't do yeah

525
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:05,210
if you want to read more yeah okay I'm

526
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,049
fantastic

527
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,059
and as you can tell I'm an American

528
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:12,860
Lawyer I came from a world before before

529
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,620
I worked in software I was a lawyer for

530
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,950
traditional companies including a

531
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,259
proprietary software company and so I

532
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,809
came to free software sort of after

533
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,809
having traditional training and in the

534
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,299
legal system and and trademark and

535
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,730
copyright in particular and one of the

536
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,450
things I've always been interested in is

537
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,220
whether or not the legal system is

538
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,990
actually performing the job that we that

539
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,119
it that it was meant to perform in a

540
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,519
particular context so I've always had

541
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,309
the sense that sometimes as lawyers we'd

542
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,070
love to have this sort of doctrine that

543
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,809
you go in and you can look up what the

544
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,850
rule is particularly in the u.s. where

545
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,019
you have case law and we get to do

546
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,970
research and we you know look it up and

547
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,559
say oh here's the rule I have these four

548
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,450
factors I need to apply and you sort of

549
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,879
wind up and sometimes it seems that you

550
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,179
get into a system that is so far removed

551
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,629
from what the actual intention was that

552
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,789
that it you sort of have lost sight of

553
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,309
what you were trying to do and I'll and

554
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:18,619
I'll bring that start with with the US

555
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,919
Constitution and I will move it along

556
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,029
here no I'm sorry the Constitution right

557
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,269
which which as all the US lawyers have

558
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,679
been trained you don't have we have the

559
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,809
patent and copyright clause which says

560
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,230
which has this fundamental premise that

561
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,960
is that that any any lawyer I talk to

562
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,850
outside of free software just absolutely

563
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,460
cannot rid themselves of is this concept

564
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,309
that you have to incentivize people with

565
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,019
money in order for them to be creative

566
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:51,409
or to invent so I've always sort of been

567
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,119
skeptical of that I think probably a lot

568
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,259
of I would have a lot of people in the

569
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,919
room who might also be skeptical of that

570
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:59,470
then we have sort of another another

571
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,200
event which was in the early nineteen

572
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,610
eighty to see how fast I got from the

573
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:08,440
1700s to the 1980 1980 where there was a

574
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,730
there was an open question the United

575
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,470
States whether copyright weather

576
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,120
software should be subject matter of

577
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,519
copyright and there was a government

578
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,929
study and the government study said yes

579
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,139
indeed we believe that that software

580
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,389
should apply to copyright and there are

581
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:25,419
people who to this day strongly disagree

582
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,889
with that legal conclusion and I

583
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,320
understand the rationale for disagreeing

584
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,210
with it which is the highly functional

585
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,610
nature of software so as all of that as

586
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,690
a predicate what what I wonder is we

587
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,820
wound up we're sitting in these rooms

588
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,529
having these legal discussions about

589
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:44,549
these complicated licenses and and and

590
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,110
brilliant licenses I don't I think it's

591
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,840
a wonderful system but I question I'd

592
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,929
question everything about it whether the

593
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,210
copyright system whether whether the

594
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,879
legal system is performing the function

595
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,340
it needs to perform in the free software

596
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,889
world so I'm gonna start with some

597
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,679
assumptions and I will even say you can

598
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,539
disagree with these assumptions if you

599
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,519
choose to and I'd be happy to have

600
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,869
people disagree with these assumptions

601
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,460
but these are assumptions that I started

602
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,649
with in order to make a second slide so

603
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,559
the first slide was assumption the

604
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,450
adoption of free software is desirable

605
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,309
and the legal system should provide

606
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,899
incentives or at least not be an

607
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,070
obstacle to it second assumption we have

608
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,289
in free software so the legal system

609
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:30,519
should incentivize it both the

610
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,860
contributor and user level so we have a

611
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,299
lot of layers here where we can impart

612
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,240
pressure to incentivize and so for

613
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,409
example it can be the individual

614
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,869
contributor or it can be the company

615
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,730
that's using it but but there are

616
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,730
there's multiple layers going on here

617
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,340
an assumption participation is vital to

618
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,149
the success of free software this I find

619
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:58,389
interesting because this assumption is

620
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:03,340
is entirely contrary to what copyright

621
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,919
law has been built on as which this is

622
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,860
which is the assumption of an

623
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,440
individual you know the artist in the

624
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,200
garret who is creating this sort of soul

625
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,870
work and instead we have a hugely

626
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,110
collaborative work you know we there are

627
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,370
other kinds of collaborative works

628
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,230
movies and theater collaborative work

629
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,850
also but I don't think anything quite on

630
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,760
the scale of free software so those

631
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,040
those are these with those assumptions I

632
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,400
will now ask the questions which so what

633
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,799
the analysis was then so here here are

634
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,020
the the interests at play as I see them

635
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,190
in free software when we're talking

636
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,049
about the traditional sort of quote

637
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:40,440
unquote

638
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,760
intellectual property and I have not

639
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,260
included patent here because I don't

640
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,140
think that's an incentive at all but

641
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,600
what we have we have economic rights so

642
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,220
we have the economic rights we have

643
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,840
moral rights and we have goodwill I'll

644
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
talk about each of those so economic

645
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,419
rights this right I broke out so you'll

646
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,520
notice I didn't say copyright here

647
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,350
because there are two really two

648
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,160
interests that copyright covers

649
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,299
different terminology and different

650
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,799
company in different countries but we're

651
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,049
talking the two aspects of an economic

652
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,090
interest and a moral interest in the

653
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,100
work so in the terms of the economic

654
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,070
interest normally I write a book and I

655
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,809
sell the book and I get money for it

656
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,760
well that's not you can't you can't make

657
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,429
money selling free software instead the

658
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,940
economic interest comes from is much

659
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,370
more indirect you may be paid to write

660
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,130
software so you get income from that you

661
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,960
may be paid by a software company that

662
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,900
that sells and distributes software as

663
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,120
part of a larger project but you may not

664
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
even be a maiden be more indirect you

665
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,110
may work for a bank that simply uses the

666
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,120
software to facilitate the banking

667
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,610
business and pays developers to write

668
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,530
that so it's a very indirect there's

669
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,830
also it's typically characterized as an

670
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,600
economic incentive but I think that we

671
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,150
have a different kind of reward system

672
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,630
here which is where one of the rewards

673
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,820
might be that we get more free software

674
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,890
out of it that's the copyleft license or

675
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,169
simply we get improvements to it even on

676
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:08,610
a permissive license we're going to get

677
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,650
improvements on it so so there may be

678
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,320
value in that economic system but that

679
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,330
just gets realized a little a little

680
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,960
differently

681
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,910
right so one of the things I always hear

682
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,650
what's most important to developers is

683
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,780
their attribution do not mess with the

684
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,850
attribution and then but I will say the

685
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,520
moral rights I don't know if it's on the

686
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,250
next slide or not I apologize if it is

687
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,290
moral rights are not there is no duty

688
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,210
under US law at any rate to provide any

689
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,300
attribution to the author so this is an

690
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,580
incentive it's completely missing

691
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,920
altogether from u.s. copyright law and

692
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,880
then goodwill this is the concept that

693
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,110
so there's goodwill accruing to the

694
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,600
project itself a very famous project of

695
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,820
course Linux Abell gnome project it's a

696
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,140
lot of goodwill in that name there's a

697
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,790
lot of filiation there's a lot of

698
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,260
strength there's a lot of value in that

699
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,990
name don't tarnish my name don't tarnish

700
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,510
my good name and that also then I think

701
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,640
accrues to some degree to the

702
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,100
contributors to it who as members of a

703
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,280
project may sort of also get some of the

704
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,210
gloss from that from that membership so

705
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,400
those are those are the incentives that

706
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,220
I think exist in free software so the

707
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,900
question is what so am i right or not I

708
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,250
don't know we'd have to study it and

709
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,950
find out just some thoughts sort of

710
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,780
study open source companies and the

711
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,090
source of their revenue how closely is

712
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,010
it tase it actually tied to copyright

713
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,490
tied to that economic interest or not

714
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,290
some ways I suggested we could study it

715
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,560
and then after we've done that are there

716
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,780
changes to the laws that should be made

717
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,680
that would benefit free software and how

718
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,340
do we do that so for example this was my

719
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,930
point there's no copyright law that

720
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,780
requires attribution should it should an

721
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,190
employer be required to give its

722
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,320
employees attribution when they're

723
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,310
working on free software if it does

724
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,850
economic reward play a role if it does

725
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,840
is it working well if it doesn't does it

726
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,030
matter do we need to change it or is it

727
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,980
something that you know we can just

728
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,270
ignore because it doesn't it doesn't

729
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,880
have that much effect and then that

730
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,650
trademark does the trademark system do

731
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,350
enough to protect this goodwill intra

732
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,170
that particularly young projects happen

733
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,340
there all their established in the name

734
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,530
gets well-known that's great but we have

735
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,880
this sort of ambiguity about when that

736
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,430
goodwill attaches to a project with

737
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,620
pride to the project with them software

738
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,110
name titles in some countries whether

739
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,390
they protect them or not so those are

740
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,580
those are sort of the so so my takeaway

741
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,110
it was kind of like we have this really

742
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,870
awful system for trying to incentivize

743
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,950
what we want to incentivize it doesn't

744
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,990
yeah we see it seems to work so are

745
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,480
there better ways to do it

746
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,280
is it should we leave it as it is is it

747
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,530
work or should we investigate and see

748
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,300
whether there are other ways that we can

749
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,670
satisfy my basic assumptions which is

750
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,770
more participation more adoption those

751
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:23,410
things questions that we enter questions

752
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,970
[Music]

753
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:33,920
so now it's time for discussion most st.

754
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,480
essentially so sorry I'm gonna move over

755
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,860
here where there's not so much of a

756
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,780
problem with feedback and whether it

757
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,300
might make most sense to deal with sort

758
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,850
of Pam's section first because that's

759
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,890
sort of freshers their minds and you

760
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,790
know if we've got any thoughts about

761
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,680
that that's probably the place start

762
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,970
then work backwards that makes sense

763
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,960
yeah okay so I don't know that the

764
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,700
necessarily the best way to deal with it

765
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,650
first of all you know any questions from

766
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,150
from Pam's interesting talk

767
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:07,220
yes do you need a microphone so my

768
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,460
question I guess has to do with

769
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,370
jurisdictions one of the great things

770
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,190
about Foss is that it's a global

771
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,880
phenomenon and yet the law is very

772
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,659
specific to jurisdictions and so the

773
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,889
incentives that you talk about are going

774
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,260
to be different across jurisdictions is

775
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,510
there something that we can learn from

776
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,460
false to bring it back to the legal

777
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,489
profession to if you will harmonize the

778
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,989
incentives globally

779
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,099
yeah that's I mean that's a really good

780
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,418
question that's sort of an even higher

781
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,609
level than then you're absolutely right

782
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:48,869
and that's kind of when I broke it out

783
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,940
as economic and moral it was recognizing

784
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,040
that what we're looking for isn't is a

785
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,180
normative situation and then in the

786
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,609
different countries laws each adopted

787
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:00,630
differently so I think that's like

788
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,000
that's sort of that the even follow-on

789
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,310
question is once we discover whether or

790
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,720
not the system is working

791
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,660
you know how then do we implement it on

792
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,089
a specific level in each country that's

793
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:14,839
a good point

794
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,240
so you mentioned several frameworks of

795
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,030
law to try to incentivize these things

796
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,240
and provide the goals that you want to

797
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,069
what extent is it worth considering

798
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,859
whether exclusive rights in law like

799
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,900
copyright are the right instrument to

800
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,619
use versus going beyond those and just

801
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,990
outright saying here's a legal contract

802
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,540
as a license and the contract says

803
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,180
exactly what we want and what we get and

804
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,369
whether or not it needs any basis in

805
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:49,460
copyright or some other exclusive right

806
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,900
we've traditionally shied away from that

807
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,510
in open source licenses and said

808
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,790
copyright defines the complete scope of

809
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,859
the license could we get more out of not

810
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,869
doing that yes so the difficulty was

811
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,160
trying to do it just on a contractual

812
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,140
level is then you need privity between

813
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,910
the the P to the party someone has to

814
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,000
accept the terms so I can I can in in

815
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,470
the u.s. at varies from country to

816
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,270
country but I can sort of impose just

817
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,670
about anything I want and a contract but

818
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,770
I have to but you have to agree agree to

819
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,540
it so that's where that's what copyright

820
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,300
works is is what it is is me giving up

821
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,060
some of my exclusivity and it's only if

822
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,490
you stay within the boundaries of that

823
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,920
that the that keeps me from suing you

824
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,690
for copyright infringement but so what

825
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,829
contract doesn't you need that sort of

826
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:40,260
xclusive right found it in the law that

827
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,849
you could then wave which gives people

828
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:43,710
that incentivizes the behavior they

829
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,420
looking for and I think Andrew could

830
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,730
talk a lot about why it doesn't work in

831
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,980
hardware

832
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,810
because I mean it's that's and to me

833
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,190
that's actually another good point is

834
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,450
sort of this we've created this

835
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,640
ecosystem and in software because of

836
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,490
copyright and it works and I think a lot

837
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,140
of people have looked at it and tried to

838
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,430
figure out how to make it work in a

839
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,250
different kind of product and and we

840
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,480
haven't really been able to find a way

841
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,869
to do that so we've got a fantastic

842
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:11,910
resource here of sort of a bunch of

843
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,089
loads from different jurisdictions so my

844
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:16,980
understanding is that sunny and the US

845
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,020
law moral rights do not have a great

846
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,260
deal of standing and UK copyright law

847
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,640
moral rights exist but they're

848
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,530
specifically excluded as far as software

849
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,230
is concerned so can any lawyers for

850
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,970
other jurisdictions enlighten me as to

851
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,250
whether in a civil law jurisdictions in

852
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,099
particular moral rights to extend to

853
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:43,230
software actually just to amplify that

854
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,270
to where they they sort of it serve as

855
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,710
an incentive in software where they

856
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,240
don't they wouldn't in the u.s. they

857
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,380
wouldn't in the UK because they don't

858
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:58,170
exist at all there is no way to give up

859
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,859
your moralize rights in even for

860
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:05,160
software's in the agates in the at least

861
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,150
in Italian and other EU countries in

862
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,540
French school system - and I'm quite

863
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,630
scared about the u.s. system because the

864
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,700
author the developer could give away his

865
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,800
or her own moral rights any attribution

866
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,950
is that did I understand correctly at

867
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,328
the point okay

868
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:38,420
so I think we has a question at the back

869
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,069
here I'm gonna be so fit No so I need

870
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:44,960
the exercise right so he was asking the

871
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,500
question so in France we do have moral

872
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,010
rights it cannot be enforced it has

873
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,839
never been for software for free

874
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,510
software to my knowledge nevertheless

875
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,150
it's such a tradition that as a

876
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,579
developer working for a company or

877
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,520
contractor if you ask that your name

878
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,150
shows in the end product it will not be

879
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,089
denied most of the time so it's worth

880
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,280
pursuing from the developer point of

881
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,430
view and you have informal leverage to

882
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,589
do that Thanks I mean I think the other

883
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,960
thing is that since you know copyright

884
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,539
exists exclusive rights anyway then so

885
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,670
if you look at the noticed provisions in

886
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,740
the Apache 2.0 license for example they

887
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,910
can become and as they can act as a

888
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,319
condition on the exercise of the other

889
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:41,599
rights within the license I'm sorry not

890
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,890
the question hello i'm federico from

891
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,329
wikimedia italy I have one impression

892
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:53,690
about the the last presentation could

893
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,809
you say that your presentation is mostly

894
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:59,720
about avoiding the problem of the free

895
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,539
rider because when I asked myself what

896
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:09,230
sort of incentives we need for people I

897
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,660
would say that the incentives should

898
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,720
mostly not be legal but simply because

899
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,390
more people use a software and have an

900
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,390
interest in developing it and this is

901
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,630
how usually free software improves so

902
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,059
this brings me to a question about the

903
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:34,520
first presentation which is well how

904
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,339
much the

905
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:39,160
that restriction on procurement which

906
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,700
are required to not if I understood

907
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,630
correctly prohibits from mandating and

908
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,979
specific technology in procurement and

909
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,269
unless it's included in the European

910
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:58,180
interoperability framework and my did I

911
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,180
understand correctly and if so how well

912
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,400
did it work because in Italy we have a

913
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,539
similar law since ten years ago and it

914
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,809
didn't have an impractical effect and

915
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,920
this brings me to the to my point which

916
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,430
is in my opinion it's not so important

917
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,420
what the or it could be that it's not so

918
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,849
important what the law says what

919
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:32,279
incentive is supposed to give to

920
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:36,640
developers or software authors as much

921
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,339
as the problem that first individual

922
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:42,029
developers rarely have the ability to

923
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:45,700
actually enforce their rights and this

924
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,410
is the the first problem and second

925
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,180
sometimes the law gives them some rights

926
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,559
they do not want like the European

927
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,009
Commission is now proposing three or

928
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:04,719
five save the copyright rights out of

929
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,749
the blue which could apply to software

930
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:11,650
or some other free culture works and

931
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,289
were not included in copyright licenses

932
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:20,469
so one would have to waive again all the

933
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:22,569
new rights every time the legislature

934
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:26,529
comes up with a new crazy law and and

935
00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:28,660
you would have to retroactively leer a

936
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,479
license everything you you have produced

937
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:34,200
in the last few decades and visa versa

938
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,680
if if

939
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:46,650
the question yeah so I think it just

940
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,410
sort of summarize the question I am one

941
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,540
on sort of the general topic which is

942
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,400
yes absolutely one of the things I

943
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,980
question is do we have this incredibly

944
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,770
complicated system that serves no end

945
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,960
whatsoever that the free software might

946
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,080
exist just as happily if we didn't have

947
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,270
this incredibly complicated legal system

948
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,280
over overseeing it and that is that is

949
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,869
as I said question the assumptions

950
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:11,700
because I'm not sure that the

951
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,050
assumptions are right or that it should

952
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,089
exist at all I think we have a second we

953
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,560
have to a second answer here so so I

954
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,810
completely agree with you which is why I

955
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,450
mentioned the Constitution was I'm not

956
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,910
sure that it's right but I will there

957
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,700
was a follow-up question yes it was

958
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,349
about this framework contract it force

959
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:30,839
established 2014 and in the study we did

960
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,609
for the Swedish competition Authority

961
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:36,140
the star the project we investigated

962
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,210
most done just before that but but

963
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,400
generally I can say that there is a

964
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,859
limited understanding of the fundamental

965
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,190
principles for public procurement and

966
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,260
it's quite clear that most of the issues

967
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,170
that arises is due to a lack of

968
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,570
understanding of those principles it's

969
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,960
short term win so short term gain versus

970
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:17,940
long term benefit as we see I understand

971
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,520
that from from this talk about the moral

972
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,920
obligation that it's only enforceable

973
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,859
within a contract and so I kind of

974
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:29,339
understand the gpio CC etc doesn't fall

975
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,560
on the terminology of contract but on

976
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,470
the terminology agreement so how can we

977
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,680
turn a GPL agreement into contract so

978
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
that they can enforce the moral

979
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,220
obligations etc

980
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,100
what this yeah I mean the GPL is a

981
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,520
license which provides exclusions which

982
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,990
provides permissions under the various

983
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,420
exclusive rights that you have and the

984
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,620
most important of those are the ability

985
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,510
to copy the materials make modifications

986
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,360
to the material and also to distribute

987
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,030
the material so if you if you don't if

988
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,340
you don't comply with the obligations

989
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,340
that relate to attribution then you

990
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,930
don't have a license so whether it's a

991
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,730
contract or not is actually irrelevant

992
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,990
it means that whatever you're doing

993
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,390
whether you're distributing or whether

994
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,790
you're copying already or adapting if

995
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,900
you're not complying with those

996
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,760
obligations to retain an attribution

997
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,350
then you no longer have a license and

998
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,730
this is if you had no license at all

999
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,590
you're in breach of copyright so Martin

1000
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,240
moral rights or sit on a different level

1001
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,040
depending in which jurisdiction you're

1002
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,100
looking at I did just want to make a

1003
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,810
comment about it and that Creative

1004
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,010
Commons licenses I think are a good

1005
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,290
example so you know I can I can

1006
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,090
condition a license on being paid you I

1007
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,550
will not see you if you pay me to use my

1008
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,350
software but you can make that condition

1009
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,940
on anything and so one of the conditions

1010
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,010
that's in Creative Commons licenses and

1011
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,630
every single Creative Commons license

1012
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,100
except the public domain is the

1013
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,560
attribution requirement there is no

1014
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,390
right to attribution under the copyright

1015
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,700
law in the u.s. so I find that sort of a

1016
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,700
fascinating study and the fact that one

1017
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,260
of the biggest rewards one of the

1018
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,400
biggest things that Creative Commons

1019
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,740
wanted to preserve was attribution which

1020
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,490
is not even something that we in the US

1021
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,930
provide for and you can then therefore

1022
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,030
you only get it because they make it an

1023
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,160
obligation under the contract so I

1024
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,900
couldn't sue someone for not attributing

1025
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,180
me under US copyright law so I think I

1026
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,590
think that's an interesting very

1027
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,190
interesting point

1028
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:34,129
