1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,160
so just okay hello everyone thank you

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,650
for coming so today in the morning we

3
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,619
discussed that usability is always

4
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,620
overlooked by many open source projects

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,310
and I wanted to know why so today I want

6
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,600
to present research I did by reviewing

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,630
academic papers in this rare usability

8
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,960
and open source and what I found out

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,730
first I want to explain why I started

10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,250
this research this research started with

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,140
the fail to contribute to open source

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,149
it's my first contribution to open

13
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,700
source that never got any attention in

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,489
the project so it happened a few years

15
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,180
ago when I was working as a designer in

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,299
a big corporation working on Android

17
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,479
phones for Asia so not very satisfying

18
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,459
job I wanted to do something different

19
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,100
and I found an open source project I

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,880
thought I could make much better and I

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,619
design some work so it's always a

22
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,299
low-hanging fruit you know there are so

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,950
many issues you can fix immediately if

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,459
you work as a designer so I said middle

25
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,060
somewhere frames I gave my feedback

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,130
research and started to wait for

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,679
feedback and will received any answer at

28
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,149
all so here's a review status for three

29
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:44,179
years already so but that is expected

30
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:47,179
that maybe it's not enough just to have

31
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,349
a view to contribute to open source

32
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,469
maybe there's something else that you

33
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,389
need to know about open source in order

34
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:56,359
to become part of it so I started to

35
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,399
review academic papers and not only

36
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,369
academic papers on that topic and here

37
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,439
will present a short timeline of papers

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,989
I found I started my research from what

39
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,170
way

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,300
usability related work many of you I'm

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,590
sure know the cathedral and the bazaar

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,129
by Eric Raymond have you read it yeah so

43
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,580
it's a great overview why open source

44
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,500
and how open source is different from

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,569
traditional software development and

46
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,080
that when we think maybe if you if you

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,930
want to contribute your X to open source

48
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,849
it also have to be different from

49
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,510
traditional development about two

50
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,530
thousand or one it's a few years after

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,260
this work papers on usability and open

52
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,569
source started to appear and they're

53
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,560
more and more every year you can find

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,170
them later I will give you a link there

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,180
are not only papers but but also bigger

56
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,400
workplaces work like for example there

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,579
is a guide to usability in free software

58
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,709
by Yanni honest here it's a great work

59
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,170
so if you want to know Alon how you can

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,879
apply usability methods but you know

61
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,670
nothing about usability please learn it

62
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,400
from that work and no more papers we can

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,950
see from Finnish universe fill in the

64
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,310
University and others great work if you

65
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,900
want to find this at least please I

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,690
maintain I have already more than 30

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,099
papers and if you happen to write one or

68
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,720
you have a favorite one please

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,389
contribute and we can collect all of

70
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,239
them and learn more about usability in

71
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,060
open source and also on a side note if

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,010
you love papers I like to advertise this

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,750
initiative maybe some of you know they

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,310
know papers in love ok ok it's a great

75
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,970
meetup all over the world I started one

76
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,579
branch in Seoul dedicated only to UX

77
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,620
papers so we get together with your ex

78
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,329
papers and learn something that you

79
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,950
don't have time to learn on your daily

80
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,220
work time so what does open source think

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,329
about usability and I found this great

82
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,260
paper published in 2012 and researchers

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,978
from Western University in Canada they

84
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,089
carried out a research to find out how

85
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,340
personal purse or seek for users

86
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,680
feedback and what's the role of

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,630
usability experts in open source

88
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,410
environment so what the survey shows

89
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,530
that each 1% of contributors to open

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,160
source

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,850
please welcome so it's way shows that

92
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,580
81% contributors to open sourcing that

93
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,440
usability is important of highly

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,330
important and nobody thought it had no

95
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,729
importance however it wasn't their

96
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,700
priority when it comes to work only 32%

97
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,889
of developers think they work on

98
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,650
usability but rest they don't think it's

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,900
a quality attribute of software they

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,639
should think about 77% didn't consult

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,610
any professional experts and usability

102
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,120
and even if they did only 1/3 of them

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,910
applied the results in their work

104
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,690
so how come according to the results it

105
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,760
seems that usability is important to

106
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
software developers in open source but

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,479
no one wants to work on it they don't

108
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,200
consult experts in that area so ok if

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
the authors don't want to work maybe why

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
there are not so many designers in open

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,810
source and I'm sure there are many

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,340
designers here who have their reasons

113
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,820
why but I want to present some work I

114
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,940
found in this paper they have an

115
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,910
interesting explanation so what they did

116
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,979
they contributed his ability research to

117
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,150
some open projects and observed how core

118
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,099
teams deal with those contributions and

119
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,979
they find these three different tactics

120
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,830
they give them names and call the

121
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,930
gatekeeping tactics so what developers

122
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,120
do in order to avoid outsiders

123
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,070
contributions when it comes to usability

124
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,889
first gate keeping tactics is called

125
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,650
non-response and it's what I had in my

126
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,450
first contribution to open source so

127
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,639
like well it's your opinion if you want

128
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,470
you can develop yourself otherwise we

129
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,900
don't care so those contributions user

130
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,360
usually have no communications and no

131
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,320
erection and another one a gatekeeping

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,659
tactic is social exclusion and even

133
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,480
though

134
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,940
community accept contribution but they

135
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,810
don't accept the usability team as a

136
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,460
part of core team as a part of the

137
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,500
process and it's also discouraging

138
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,570
because it's the moment sometimes the

139
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,980
only reason why we contribute to open

140
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,420
source we want to be the part of the

141
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,420
community and another game kid keeping

142
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,820
touching cross false acceptance it's

143
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,450
wrong

144
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,480
please welcome so it's when communities

145
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,930
enthusiastic about findings apply them

146
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,580
but original developer of the future

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,540
comes in exercises right all right to

148
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,790
change software and reverted back to

149
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,030
original it also happened several times

150
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,740
so it seems seems like that

151
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,740
usability teams can that easily to

152
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,770
contribute to open source projects and

153
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,650
they don't have any impact and their

154
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,110
message fell into deaf ears most of the

155
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,020
time and it's difficult to become part

156
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,020
of the community so why and what I

157
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,820
learned from the papers there are at

158
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,340
least three reasons that that research

159
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,800
is fine and first of the first of the

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,560
reasons its its culture so there is a

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,660
cultural aspect and it's known that

162
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,400
open-source culture is known to be

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,700
meritocratic and participants games made

164
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,270
from contributing and solving hard

165
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,890
algorithmic problems so for the most

166
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,410
part is soft the more incentive

167
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,710
reputation and scent if you get and for

168
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,450
usability experts it's almost impossible

169
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,790
to gain merit because it's not

170
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,910
considered important and even the

171
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,130
structure of open-source is described in

172
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,190
papers often described as onion

173
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,310
structure you see behind me and the

174
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,810
structure will present how

175
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,970
decision-makers is distributed in the

176
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,860
community and in the center of the

177
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,190
circle it's where the old

178
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,799
decision-making power is concentrated

179
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,539
concentrated and its belong to main

180
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,640
developers and we have more and more

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,250
layers and none of them is for designers

182
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,050
and

183
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,520
one of the papers found an interesting

184
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,240
solution for that

185
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,850
so this paper published in 2009 and

186
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,970
Finland University what they suggest

187
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,710
they suggest to create an additional

188
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,740
layer for usability experts where they

189
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,560
could communicate make a decision

190
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,830
together organize a core team that would

191
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,140
communicate with the technical core team

192
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,880
in a standard like open source layer I

193
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not sure if it can work if you can

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
if you can do it but I see that open

195
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
source design communities community that

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,070
organized this room it could be place

197
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,990
like the human level up there where

198
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,330
designers get together and try to work

199
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,130
with open source projects together to

200
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,980
improve usability another reason also is

201
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,680
how using people with usability and

202
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,180
research background and people with open

203
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,930
source but background see their users so

204
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,670
in the community event technical skills

205
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,980
are the most appreciated usability

206
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,380
problems are found less interesting and

207
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,000
less challenging and in this environment

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,750
for open source this developer it's very

209
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,310
difficult to emphasize with the user

210
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,750
because he doesn't have the same

211
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,530
technical skills while all designers in

212
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,300
the area they know that that's by

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,390
definition users usually don't have any

214
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,000
idea what they use how it work and you

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
cannot know it all even though you

216
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
develop your own product when you use

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,640
other products you don't have full at

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,770
the understanding of the software so as

219
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,050
much of developers hope their user looks

220
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,710
like this

221
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,660
most of the time the user looks like

222
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,230
this and however is changing and the

223
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,280
more and more I see a great user series

224
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,980
like this Jupiter project published

225
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,160
every year the users away so that way

226
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,320
they try to find out who their user and

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,690
how to make the software better Apache

228
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,330
spark great report every year so I

229
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,610
encourage everyone to learn and do the

230
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,070
same

231
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,420
ok I need to drink a little

232
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,730
[Music]

233
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,800
another reason may be the most important

234
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,200
mentioned by papers is the approach to

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
development process which seems to be

236
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,190
completely different in open-source and

237
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,339
traditional UX to design so in

238
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,560
open-source projects usually they called

239
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,630
it mostly a bottom-up approach

240
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,100
it's where focus always on technical

241
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,019
technical issues and often projects come

242
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,820
from a little feature and more and more

243
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,360
features added technically edit and

244
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,149
usability issues bypassed completely but

245
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,540
in design you usually start with the

246
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,880
top-down approach where user designers

247
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,290
usability designers they have played the

248
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,120
role of user representative from the

249
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,519
beginning of the project they have

250
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,550
decision-making power and also equal to

251
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,070
developers to make decisions and that's

252
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,560
where we understand by many big projects

253
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,139
that have foundation behind so the

254
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,660
projects like usually those projects

255
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,089
they would have guidelines they have a

256
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,459
great community like my zero they have

257
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,649
great resources where you can learn how

258
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,140
to improve their product and contribute

259
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,320
to usability it's also much easier to

260
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,470
use top-down approach with the smaller

261
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,690
companies when you have just all have

262
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,399
projects or where only few people

263
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,440
contribute so that from the beginning

264
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,529
they can or they can care about

265
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:31,170
usability and work on it better for

266
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,750
example this project from Madrid called

267
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,839
have a beautiful Russian named tiger

268
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,579
it's one of the great examples when

269
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,680
usability was considered from the

270
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,930
beginning of the project because project

271
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,459
had just a few contributors from one

272
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,279
company and that project looks great by

273
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:50,579
the way

274
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,850
team is here over there great product

275
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,740
also the same company Yeah right brother

276
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,980
and also I'm sure that everyone who

277
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,750
knows about this one is looking forward

278
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,050
for the launching day this is open

279
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,620
source UX bar

280
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,650
to that core that is designed for

281
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,950
prototyping and we also really looking

282
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,060
forward to that so it's easier when the

283
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,580
team is one or two people but how about

284
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,620
all other projects that already exist

285
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,890
there and how an independent designer

286
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,580
can contribute or become part of it so

287
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,440
it's not amazing a question that all of

288
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,420
us are trying to answer in this room

289
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,760
today but what I know for sure that

290
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,100
development that any community cannot

291
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,300
grow unless it develops and improves so

292
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,390
I believe that both of the sides of in

293
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,850
this conversation technical contributors

294
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,130
and design contributors have to find

295
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,000
common ground and it's not only for

296
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,950
developers to learn about his ability

297
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,140
it's for us designers to learn about

298
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,200
culture and understand how we can become

299
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,450
part of it so since there are many

300
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,550
designers in this room I want to share

301
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,980
my experience and what I learn how to

302
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,330
participate in open source design and if

303
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,160
you want to become a part of the project

304
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,070
before anything first you have to be

305
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,940
user of that project and once once you

306
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,820
gain some once you become part of you

307
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,950
can because of the community and gain

308
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,270
some visibility you can start

309
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,340
contributing and it's not a good idea to

310
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,260
contribute for usability issues because

311
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,240
it's sometimes you know those

312
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,130
gatekeeping tactics could stop you from

313
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,830
that so as much it may be easier to

314
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,740
start with the approved documentation

315
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,020
report box and be local user of the

316
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,050
community and only after that maybe it's

317
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,570
a good idea to start the designer of

318
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,900
open source project in order to be a

319
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,000
successful member of the community

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,900
so my final ideas I want to share with

321
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,090
you so as much as we designers like to

322
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,280
think that everyone needs to understand

323
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,800
what usability is I think what's more

324
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,200
important for us to be part of the

325
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,930
community and gain social capital with

326
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,870
the community members and also build

327
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,130
trust by understanding how

328
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,940
source work so it was my short talk

329
00:15:25,940 --> 00:16:04,790
thank you and if you have any so the

330
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,010
question was how to how to find the

331
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,480
designer on the project right and yeah

332
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,100
okay

333
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,970
I think so what we're trying to do with

334
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,830
open source design initiative is to

335
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,040
build foundations for designers to be

336
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
able to join open source projects

337
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,450
because it's not easy you've seen three

338
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,250
years ago I started it's still difficult

339
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,580
for me to to find the project and become

340
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,850
a member and I think the more we

341
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,390
advocate for open source culture the

342
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,330
more designers can join and understand

343
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,310
that they also can have impact in this

344
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,370
and become part of the community so I

345
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,440
think I hope that that would be the

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,570
foundation of our work in open source

347
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,210
design so the more you have people

348
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,450
contributing the more designers open

349
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,330
source projects will have I don't have a

350
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,829
recipe there's no silver bullet for that

351
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,630
there's a pool of designers you can come

352
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,750
to open source design dotnet our

353
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,280
community please check out our

354
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,910
repository as well we advertise it many

355
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,109
many times today but also if you want

356
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,660
design and working only in your projects

357
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,910
it should be a user of your project

358
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,430
sometimes you can you can get some free

359
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,160
work from open source design community

360
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,840
hopefully you can get someone who can

361
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,870
live

362
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,480
and with your project and contribute

363
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,309
constantly it would be the perfect case

364
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,500
and there are projects like that and

365
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,929
there are many projects that get many

366
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,860
designers like next cloud what's your

367
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,010
name what's the name of the project next

368
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,470
club right sorry

369
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,760
so there are many projects that have

370
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,860
designers but it's a long way of

371
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,070
learning and understanding what how you

372
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:12,899
can impact and change the yes yes yes

373
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,090
but I think this is the way we have to

374
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,279
go through and grow and get more people

375
00:18:18,279 --> 00:19:13,559
and thank brings a question regarding

376
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,830
like the different types of design for

377
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,809
me design everything developing you

378
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,659
design software develop this usability

379
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,539
design there is also graphic design so

380
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,120
whether the most complicated part in

381
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,950
open-source is graphic design or

382
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,200
although because usability is something

383
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,350
you can measure if you can measure then

384
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,899
it's much easier to distribute in open

385
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,450
source and talk about it and find

386
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,169
understanding but when it comes to

387
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,000
graphic design I'm curious myself how to

388
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,340
make it open code how to make it work in

389
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,950
open source so maybe it's a bit the

390
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,760
complete

391
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,340
different question and the most

392
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,049
difficult question is graphic design

393
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,480
because again I'm not sure many people

394
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,090
can collaborate on graphical design

395
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,010
while I believe people can collaborate

396
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,950
on usability issues and UX design
