1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,889
right hello everybody I'm Dave prisoned

2
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,340
and I work for a company called show

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,290
vine and they pay for me to come here so

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,669
I might as well put their logo on things

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,860
so the show vine do secure collaboration

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,259
with people who really really care about

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,020
security which is what draws me into

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,770
this kind of area but this is mostly

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,020
mostly just a hobby project that I've

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,560
developed and we've taken on as I has a

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,710
bit of a product so XMPP looks a bit

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,500
like this on on a on a sort of a network

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,890
diagram you have clients which talk to

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,420
servers and servers talk to other

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,540
servers if we add in another client it

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,640
looks much the same but you see that

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,470
clients don't talk to clients it's only

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,350
that servers talk to servers if you add

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,220
in another domain then you get in

20
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,959
certainly please admire these lines they

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,030
took me ages the blinky lines offering

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,130
CSS animation animation is really

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,039
impressive I thought so and these you

24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,170
get domains talking to the mains talking

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,929
the domains vailed you full mesh and the

26
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:18,249
clients just hang offs particular

27
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,289
servers but the problem with this is

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,799
it's not a really sensible view of the

29
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,350
world because these two domains are both

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,030
montagu they're both probably on the

31
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,210
same physical server so in fact they're

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,369
probably the same process let alone the

33
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,149
same organization so the way that the

34
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,399
way that I tend to think about XMPP is

35
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,899
like this you have a set of if we're

36
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,579
going to use pot language autonomous

37
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:50,200
security domains which I have within

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,240
them they operate their own security

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,779
policy they they they set the they set

40
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:58,479
the rules the clients live within those

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
that the server's live within those

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,859
everything and then they have borders

43
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,929
and then they send traffic past those

44
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,050
borders into in this case calculate

45
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,030
sending ties Verona and house Montague

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,760
to ages of Shakespearean research to

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,040
figure out a third one there

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,549
and it's all Watts meter and well I like

49
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,079
to call it a borderline server but

50
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,709
marketing taught me that I can't so it's

51
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,680
maybe in a nest West proxy a server

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,870
deserve of proxies is one way of looking

53
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,750
at it a border gateway although that's

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,079
possibly a bit misleading

55
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,310
yeah and SBC in sip turns but XMPP

56
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,739
doesn't have those and a perimeter

57
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,670
filter is another way of looking at it

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,780
there is another way of looking at it

59
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,159
but we don't mention that so where does

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,560
it fit in this diagram because I need I

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,269
put it in the diagram somewhere in the

62
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,680
answer is well it kind of doesn't

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,590
because the the this diagram doesn't

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,260
change what we're doing is meter lives

65
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
in these lines here in these boxes it

66
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,569
acts as the border it acts as the

67
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:14,319
perimeter so capulet servers how many it

68
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,230
has connect to the eighth's meter as if

69
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,939
it's Montague they they don't really

70
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,970
care that just connecting out so open

71
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,040
FirePro city both have overrides to let

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,159
you do this very very nice and simply

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,650
meter then pretends to be Capulet as it

74
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,879
connects to Montague servers so it is

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,560
fronting Capulet that I don't like that

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,090
where it pretends though because it

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,650
implies that it's doing something wrong

78
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,599
and there's lots of words that sound

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,540
really wrong here spoofs fakes

80
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,970
masquerades all of these have to go what

81
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,310
it's doing is it's it authenticates as

82
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,319
Capulet to Montague it's it's

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,599
legitimately acting that way so quick

84
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,150
reminder of how authentication works and

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,599
server to server in XMPP because not

86
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
everyone will remember this straight off

87
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,549
and it's a bit complicated originally we

88
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,069
had dial back and that was our first

89
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,659
attempt at security in server-to-server

90
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,269
and it looks roughly that you've got two

91
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,609
connections one connection comes in says

92
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,978
hello I'm hanging you know hey Bob it's

93
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,839
as the

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,600
receiving server then connects back to

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,460
the originating server and just checks

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,070
that it's the right connection and if it

97
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,330
is then we're all good

98
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,680
dial back is reliant on DNS and here's a

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,790
alternative fact quote from Trump

100
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,870
explaining how good DNS is DNS can be

101
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,270
spooked it's there are problems there we

102
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,580
never had a problem in the XMPP network

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,919
as far as I'm aware but it's not good to

104
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,300
rely on it so maybe we should do DNS a

105
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,910
dns a secure DNS I mean it basically

106
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,790
it's that the TLS for DNS I don't know I

107
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,729
call it what you like it means that you

108
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,419
can rely on the DNS data go to a

109
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,370
cryptographic level and this gives us

110
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,750
something called securely derived

111
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,729
reference identifiers which are to do

112
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:18,690
with it's not TLS it's signing hush now

113
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,930
so for TLS in XMPP tones we always have

114
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,450
to check the certificate for the domain

115
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,410
and not the host unless we've got DNS

116
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,560
SEC at which point is the host as well

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,240
yeah unless there's Dane at which point

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,470
it might be neither or we might be doing

119
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,240
something else with with fingerprinting

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,810
entirely so there's a lot of variations

121
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,669
there TLS with XMPP is opportunistic we

122
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,910
use the start TLS model which was sort

123
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,220
of pioneered by a cap as I'm sure you're

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,110
all familiar with a cap I like to slip a

125
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,440
cap into every talk except that we've

126
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,289
actually developed a quite recent spec

127
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:07,060
at 368 where it likes more like HTTPS

128
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,060
where it operates on a separate port so

129
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,090
through again lot of variations sorry

130
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,389
did these last night when I was drunk

131
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,280
so meter supports a selection of

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,800
standards as will be on the the basic

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,060
XMPP and I I'm sure you all know what

134
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,290
all of these are so exact 220 is dial

135
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,310
back yeah it's at 344 that's dial back

136
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,150
with TLS then there's three six one

137
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,580
that's SATCOM XMPP of a SATCOM

138
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,290
meter supports that as well for low

139
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,210
bandwidth situation 368 we've mentioned

140
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,150
immediate mo TLS 6125

141
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,600
TLS P kicks off a rather obscure one

142
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,950
because nobody seems to reference it

143
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,169
it's quite useful for 33 to 35 is DNS

144
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,400
SEC 50 to 80 is PK x and c are ELLs we

145
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,690
have to do crl checking what's that and

146
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,750
then we've got Dane and Dane SRV so

147
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,190
there's quite a lot there and the other

148
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,830
features it can do are lots and lots and

149
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,770
lots of per domain controls so that you

150
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,720
can tweak the cipher lists a particular

151
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,160
domains you can tweak the the D H

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,169
parameter length to particular domains

153
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,479
if you want and as well as whether

154
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,580
you're enforcing TLS or not it also

155
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,889
handles DNS overrides that oh I should

156
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,710
have really logged out you know and it

157
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,639
say hello to Chris so DNS overrides

158
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,099
allow you to override what connection

159
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,139
it's what what server is connecting to

160
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,570
and everyone's coming on on offline I

161
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,340
really should have should have thought

162
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,789
of that before it allows you to inject

163
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,520
SRV records and it allows you to thank

164
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,539
Hewitt and and it allows you to inject

165
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,789
TLS a records so that you can do

166
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,580
certificate pinning via injected Dane

167
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,669
records if you want which is again yeah

168
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,120
useful

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,840
quick trip around the internals am i

170
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,990
doing for time okay quick trip around

171
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,160
the internals it's written in C++ 11

172
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,670
with bits of 14 as I gradually gradually

173
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,220
got to got familiar with them so that

174
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,570
might give you some idea of how long

175
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,140
I've been working on this now all of the

176
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,729
code and all of its operations are

177
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,830
assumed to be security sensitive which

178
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,229
in which has certain implications on the

179
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:39,799
design

180
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,500
yeah it's assumed that it is

181
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,330
internet-facing it is assumed that it is

182
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,100
right on the on the perimeter it does

183
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,230
assume that every configuration option

184
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,500
has a security impact it's designed to

185
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,330
be sysadmin friendly it doesn't have

186
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,850
users users don't connect to it it's

187
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,730
designed to be support friendly so that

188
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,860
we can build sherline can build support

189
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,300
contracts and it's designed once all of

190
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
those that are dealt with it is designed

191
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,260
to be very very fast at switching at

192
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,140
switching stanzas XMPP sort of packet

193
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,800
equivalent to go through a bit more

194
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,540
detail I think this was actually Edwin

195
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,650
it was there you go / - why I picked C++

196
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,340
11 because it's it's it's really nice no

197
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,220
other reason really security there is no

198
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,920
web interface it's just a

199
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,200
straightforward flat config file you

200
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,240
added it with operating system security

201
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,790
and because there isn't even any sig

202
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,560
hutch support because I decided that

203
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,710
when I looked at it to work out exactly

204
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,810
which which connections had to be

205
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,270
restarted for a given conflict change I

206
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,010
simply thought was too high-risk so

207
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,080
that's gone it does have pretty terrible

208
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,850
testing I will admit that if any of you

209
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,380
had Google some of the Summer of Code

210
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,750
students I would love to where to see

211
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,080
some approaches to to a touch framework

212
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,170
for this on the other hand the code is

213
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,530
very carefully statically analyzed and

214
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,140
and it's exploratory tested fairly well

215
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,620
but as far as this admin friendly goes

216
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,660
well XML config file

217
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,560
do we like XML I don't know I like it

218
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,560
it has smart cascading defaults so

219
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,380
changing a changing a global will have

220
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,740
an effect on other dependent are the

221
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,440
dependent settings to make them the the

222
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,690
sensible default given the global this

223
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,190
sort of thing it also has a runtime

224
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,880
config come on to but at the moment that

225
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,589
it really comes into its own when you're

226
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,620
dealing with support so by a runtime

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,410
config done the config file that reads

228
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,810
in it will then write out the entire

229
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,420
configuration into a file this is

230
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,339
actually an example of part of the

231
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,660
config file screens not wide enough but

232
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,220
you'll see that not only do it does it

233
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,130
write out all the settings including any

234
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,160
defaults any drive settings so it

235
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,330
includes like the fact that we're

236
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,370
checking pickax status and this sort of

237
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,550
thing it also includes comments about

238
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:20,670
the configuration so we so in order to

239
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,410
figure out exactly what you're running

240
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,480
configuration really is you have a

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,640
complete snapshot of it including any

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
reference certificates keys the the

243
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,260
whole lot put in the data directory so

244
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,620
that you can find it and examine it and

245
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,970
yeah potentially examine it for changes

246
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,510
so fast switching means very few buffer

247
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,310
copies very fast parsing I use a fork of

248
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,520
rapid XML which I've announced a bit and

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,650
that one of the things that rapid accent

250
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,560
XML allows us to do is skip XML resi

251
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,490
realization retail realization is is at

252
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,350
least those slowest parsing so if we can

253
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,820
skip it we skipped half the time and

254
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,459
what I mean by this is his that his

255
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,900
Estanza and we've got the what we tend

256
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,620
to refer to as the stands the header

257
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,959
sort of the the message tags themselves

258
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,270
and what we can do is we can extract

259
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,360
this string here and simply copy it from

260
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,450
one buffer to another rapid XML allows

261
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,700
us to do this it makes it very very fast

262
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,130
to to move stanzas from one interface to

263
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,560
another which keeps the latency Brahe

264
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,610
nice and low

265
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,100
so as I say I I wrote these while I was

266
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,560
drunk and so what what can we do now

267
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,010
because we are sitting in this in this

268
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,960
diagram on these edges now that we're

269
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,670
there and we've established the the

270
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,580
security between these there at a basic

271
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,380
communications level what else can we do

272
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,860
with this

273
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,750
so meter has a concept of filters which

274
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,670
allow you to read in the stanzas as

275
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,640
they're going through perhaps choose to

276
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,070
discard them perhaps choose to create

277
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,160
new ones so that we can respond to

278
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,500
traffic that before it hits the the real

279
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,520
server and potentially alter them only I

280
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,839
haven't actually written the API for

281
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,910
that but you can always just discard and

282
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,950
create new ones so it's not a huge deal

283
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,130
the examples that I got the XMPP world

284
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,140
has a has a problem with Russian spam at

285
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,540
the moment so just as a just as a proof

286
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,100
of concept I knocked out something that

287
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,620
will take you to code code blocks and go

288
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,690
yeah it contains this one and I don't

289
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,330
speak any Russian despite having Russian

290
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,480
friends and so I can drop those packets

291
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,010
on the floor and my spam goes away

292
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,530
that's very very nice although quite

293
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,140
brutal but it's it's a it's an

294
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,930
interesting proof of concept a slightly

295
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,390
more interesting one is this disco is

296
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,120
the capability discovery mechanism and

297
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,940
XMPP and what we can do is as disco

298
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,260
requests come in so for the discovery we

299
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,070
can hand back a previous discovery

300
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,650
response so that again that never passes

301
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,920
through now this in combination with a

302
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,230
use of meteor in for example SATCOM when

303
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,970
you've got very slow links can save

304
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,930
quite a large amount of traffic at least

305
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,520
one does because like before

306
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,980
[Laughter]

307
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,410
and so what's on the roadmap on the

308
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,530
roadmap we can we've got the the

309
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,390
functionality so what else can we do we

310
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,520
could we could actually suppress maybe

311
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,640
inject client capabilities and which

312
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,560
seems like a useful trick to be able to

313
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,500
do so we can instead of many blocking

314
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,420
say file transfer traffic if you don't

315
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,850
allow that across your parameter we

316
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,560
might say we might start saying well

317
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,810
actually this this client can't even do

318
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,420
file transfer don't offer it which

319
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,180
improves the user experience instead of

320
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,450
simply blocking traffic other things we

321
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,020
can do speaking of file transfer we can

322
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,720
intercept maybe bridge between goods so

323
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,230
that we can inject file transfer proxies

324
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,990
things like this strip out internal

325
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,040
network addresses on on his sessions

326
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,020
maybe even check files maybe dump them

327
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,700
in and virus scan them on the way

328
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,580
through so we've got again a large

329
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,990
number of options things that you want

330
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,250
to do on your perimeter finally security

331
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,310
labeling like I say shoreline works in

332
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,650
in some high security environments

333
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,450
although we mostly use security labeling

334
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,340
here in cyber threat intelligence and

335
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,160
the enterprise world and we've already

336
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,710
got a complete security labeling

337
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,300
implementations called spoofing I did a

338
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,090
lightning talk on that last year and so

339
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,640
we can actually build in a policy

340
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,770
enforcement point check labels against

341
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,530
clearances exciting things like that

342
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,210
and we can do where we can do more than

343
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,090
that I'm really keen to if anybody is a

344
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,900
potential google Summer of Code student

345
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm really keen to where to see what

346
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,480
people can do with us you would be will

347
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,420
be working within the the X the XMPP

348
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,220
standards foundation there's an umbrella

349
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,340
group for Google of Summer of Code and

350
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,470
if you're if you're able to pitch in an

351
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,980
idea I'm really I'm all ears

352
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,560
so with that oh I make it three minutes

353
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
20 seconds

354
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,790
are there any questions have you done

355
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,270
intro tests between meter and other

356
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,180
service well there is only one of them I

357
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,010
know and and you develop it I know

358
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,600
so you can answer that question yourself

359
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,260
which would be not yet but I have

360
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,650
discussed that discussed this with your

361
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,369
cer in fact and he said yes so yeah

362
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,990
that's very much on the cards yes much

363
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,689
as we like to have the entire pie

364
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,439
obviously if we don't we should at least

365
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,949
interoperate indeed yeah very much

366
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,690
though I mean I I run meteor in

367
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,210
production against my protecting my own

368
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,730
server so I'm confident that it works

369
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,520
with a wide range of service but the

370
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,690
yeah formal interrupt testing

371
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,600
particularly with the satcoms SATCOM and

372
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,930
labeling yeah absolutely

373
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:52,880
okay and I really should have put the

374
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,410
github repository on here should night

375
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,820
it is open source

376
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,930
I've always that would be really

377
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,340
embarrassing coming here and talking

378
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,220
about something that wasn't wouldn't so

379
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,520
it's MIT license and it is on github was

380
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,830
within my github you can look for meter

381
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,890
within my github handle is DWD Delta

382
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,460
whiskey Delta

383
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,610
that the issues that you don't see the

384
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,790
road IP the certain issue or something

385
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,350
you would like to solve I mean this is a

386
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,600
parameter you don't see the remote I

387
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,179
know you don't that's because you will

388
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,990
see meat as I hear us from the inside

389
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,309
it's only a problem if you're trying to

390
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,410
do security in perimeter security on the

391
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,540
inside but I'm assuming you'd do the

392
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,970
perimeter security within meter so I'm

393
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,640
thinking not god I got one minute 13

394
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,970
seconds

395
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,019
I guess I think you've made some time

396
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,020
you

397
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,270
[Applause]
