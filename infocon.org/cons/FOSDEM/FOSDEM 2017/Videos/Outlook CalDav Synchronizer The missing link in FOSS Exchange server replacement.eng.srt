1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,100
good morning everybody thank you for

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,070
being upright and early our next speaker

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,980
is Alex an animal vol to talk to to talk

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,629
to us about outlook out of

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:19,810
synchronization Alexander it's yours

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,220
good morning everybody thanks for

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,740
joining this early on a Sunday morning I

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,840
would like to present you the outlook

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,558
Calif synchronizer the missing link in

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,040
open source exchange server replacement

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,520
let's start with the nightmare of every

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,630
IT department which tries to deploy an

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,180
open source group resolution because

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,980
it's the integration of Outlook anybody

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,750
tried out this little connector here

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,180
it's I can't really recommend it that's

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,230
a three-phase to USB connector so that's

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,239
the feeling you have and when you try to

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,328
integrate out looking many open source

20
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,610
solutions yeah ok more seriously what

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,570
are the alternatives to exchange outlook

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,950
deployments of course there's the

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,740
Exchange ActiveSync protocol some open

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,549
source solutions implemented that but

25
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,190
it's still a proprietary protocol of

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,490
course and it also has some limitations

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,340
together with Outlook but I believe you

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,920
will hear more about that solution in

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,110
the next dog from Capano

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,619
they implemented such a integration as

31
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,189
well now then there was open change it's

32
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,720
the only open source

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,360
moppy implementation on top of Sam

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,750
before but unfortunately this project

35
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,930
got stalled as well even the website is

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,040
down at the moment an term many other

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,490
so-called open group resolutions which

38
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,750
use proprietary connectors for

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,669
integrating Outlook or dropped outlook

40
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,730
support completely like Sarah was doing

41
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,260
in the last year's so

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,500
hopefully we can come to the rescue we

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,610
are the only open source outlook add-in

44
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,730
for supporting the open protocols

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,000
cardiff & cardiff we can synchronize

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,090
events tasks and contacts between

47
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,290
outlook and any color for cutoff server

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,200
it's under a GPL version 3 license and

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,920
it was initially initially developed as

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,739
a master thesis project the first

51
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,500
proof-of-concept at the University of

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,239
Applied Sciences technique convened in

53
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,400
Vienna in the software engineering

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,450
master degree program so this was around

55
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,239
2 years ago I believe and nowadays we

56
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,209
have more than 350,000 downloads and the

57
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,530
rising community so rather successful

58
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,430
these days it's based on C sharp and

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,530
dotnet 40.5 framework supported Outlook

60
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,980
versions are starting from 2007 to the

61
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,120
latest 2016 of course that's also a

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,730
advantage compared to active sync

63
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,829
because active sync is only available in

64
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,540
Outlook 2013 and newer surprisingly

65
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,609
there are still a lot of older outlook

66
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,590
installations around and to be really

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,620
good as many many we are asking us if we

68
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,049
could support the Outlook 2007 as well

69
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:51,530
we we didn't intend to do it first but

70
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,709
what we changed some of the code to

71
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,280
support it as well and let's come to the

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,290
features the main features of course

73
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,449
it's possible to have a two-way

74
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,190
synchronization a nice feature is a time

75
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,349
rich time range filtering which can

76
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,840
drastically reduce the amount of traffic

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,919
and synchronization time because it's

78
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,659
rather useless for example to

79
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:21,349
synchronize 3000 events which which lie

80
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,710
5 years in the past for example this is

81
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,289
possible from most kind of servers but

82
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,719
many clients don't don't support it for

83
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,520
example is Thunderbird lightning

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,610
you don't have the possibility to select

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,310
the time range so this is a nice feature

86
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,190
which is also not possible with active

87
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,430
sync in that and that kind of course we

88
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,620
have transport layer security support

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,530
you can use self-signed certificates if

90
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,410
you allow it explicitly and there are

91
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,710
client certificate authentication

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,319
possible as well then we support out the

93
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,060
discovery which is also a nice feature

94
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,139
you can configure it on the server side

95
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,479
so you don't need calendar the exact

96
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,240
calendar resource URL like in in sounder

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
but for example so you can how to

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,610
discover all calendars if you just enter

99
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,169
the server URL so as a possible to have

100
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,889
DNS service record lookups for discovery

101
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,580
of the server address from the email

102
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,449
address for example regarding Google

103
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,680
support that's kind of difficult story

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,729
because Google has a color so it's

105
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,199
working quite well but for cutoff gmail

106
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,729
contacts or tasks Google Tasks this

107
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:51,050
support is missing so we decided to

108
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,990
implement native Google api's to support

109
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,860
that as well so you can have own Google

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,650
account type with oauth2 authentication

111
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,060
and set up to sync all stuff with the

112
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,259
Google server as well so it's a special

113
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,819
profile diagram another aspect is

114
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,509
timezone support

115
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,680
unfortunately windows uses different

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,310
timezone identifier stand the standard

117
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,000
Ayana or sometimes on database which can

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,139
lead to interoperability issues that we

119
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,650
solve that with the help of mapping

120
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,599
possibilities so you can choose manually

121
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,050
there

122
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,740
Ayana time timezone we map that or you

123
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,900
can switch to you to see if you

124
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,020
you prefer that as well this makes a

125
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,570
difference of course for recurring

126
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,560
events which span over daylight saving

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,259
time changes for example that could

128
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,949
could be difficult we also support to

129
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,880
map the fur method appointment bodies

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
from from Outlook so the formatting

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,020
doesn't get lost but unfortunately it's

132
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,380
not stored in HTML so we needed to

133
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,889
convert it from the RTF format which

134
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,979
outlook uses internally to HTML

135
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,690
description and we store that on the

136
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,840
card of servers and extended alternative

137
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,150
description attribute so that's a nice

138
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,169
feature as well here you can see

139
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,660
advanced settings dialog we use in

140
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,000
rather modern WPF UI from from Windows

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,960
so it integrates quite well today

142
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,039
outlook settings a nice feature as well

143
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,430
as the possibility to synchronize

144
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,720
different server calendars into one

145
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,510
outlook folder and you can distinguish

146
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,229
them by outlook categories you can even

147
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,240
map server calendar colors to the

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,919
outlook category color so you have a

149
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,039
nice merged view of your of your server

150
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,740
resources in one Outlook calendar folder

151
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,990
for example you can configure these

152
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,449
Advanced Settings this is of course

153
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,610
hidden in the in the normal user view

154
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,500
and you have to enable the Advanced

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,449
Settings because it's rather complicated

156
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,900
to set everything up but predefined

157
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,229
profiles available you can use them for

158
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,539
existing server server supports we

159
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,510
support already some some of the

160
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,849
well-known so I was with predefined

161
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,170
settings for each of them more fancy

162
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,400
stuff is for example support for

163
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,140
distribution lists as far as I know we

164
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,000
are the only outlook add-in which

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,360
supports the Sogo released format it's a

166
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,580
special

167
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,190
from out the saga crew / server uses to

168
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,950
store contact groups and we can map them

169
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,769
to Outlook distribution list the members

170
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,930
of such contact groups are linked to the

171
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,510
individual contacts of course so if you

172
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,940
change and email it right there it's it

173
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,459
gets reflected to the member in the

174
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,890
distribution list and updated there as

175
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,490
well of course so this is quite nice and

176
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,220
we plan to support more such group

177
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,430
formats because this is a bit difficult

178
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,029
and we cut standard the different kinds

179
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,630
of concepts how to store groups and we

180
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,420
have to try to to support all different

181
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,240
kinds of debt and interrupt with mobile

182
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
clients like tough trade for example

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,740
which uses also some of that group stuff

184
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,070
for Android as a small case study I can

185
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,550
show you the deployment with it in a

186
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,310
university setup it's quite

187
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,279
heterogeneous environment we try to

188
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,279
support all possible clients and on the

189
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,820
server side we have a sober Krupa server

190
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,110
supported clients are Outlook of course

191
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,000
with our attend and Thunderbird

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,750
lightning on the mobile site we support

193
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,940
Android with DAF through it it's another

194
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,760
open source code of client which we can

195
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,000
recommend and of course there is native

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,240
colors and color support in all Apple

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,520
devices we also implemented an LDAP

198
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,680
global address book you can add that as

199
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,010
an account type in Outlook and with the

200
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,050
help of that it is possible to set up

201
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,520
global outlook free PC ul we made a web

202
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,769
front-end small PHP script which let the

203
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,579
user allows the user to configure the

204
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,279
free/busy calendars which should be

205
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,430
included in the free/busy URL and with

206
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,250
that together we stay at rest book you

207
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,320
can configure global outlook

208
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,700
but a placeholder name is is map to the

209
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,730
individual contact and you can add

210
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,010
attendees to the meetings and check

211
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,680
their availability and schedule meetings

212
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,450
with that so it works rather rather

213
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,990
valent but similar to an exchange setup

214
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,130
so this is a nice nice feature the

215
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,460
internal architecture is implemented as

216
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,410
a generic synchronization framework so

217
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,200
it's not limited to color for our cutoff

218
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,400
sync we can synch arbitrary entities

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,700
which are versioned with with server

220
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,700
entities it's implemented internally as

221
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,660
a state machine rather generic

222
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,580
architecture and the focus is on

223
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,370
performance we did some tests recently

224
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,550
for example it's possible to sync 3,500

225
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,940
contacts initially in 90 seconds that

226
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,550
sounds much but the limiting factor here

227
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,050
is the outlook object model and we

228
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,390
tested a commercial out look at the in

229
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,330
which nearly needed one second per per

230
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,570
entity so this would have taken one hour

231
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,910
for the initial thing so it's rather

232
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,660
faster our solution hopefully and

233
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,460
consequent subsequent syncs without any

234
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,430
changes take around three seconds and so

235
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,020
it's rather rather fast

236
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,090
hopefully compared to two other

237
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,570
solutions there are some challenges of

238
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,060
course we are dependent on c-sharp

239
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,460
iCalendar and we cut parses mmm both

240
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,880
projects here rather abandoned and it's

241
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
they are need need desperately needed

242
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,150
developer some features are missing we

243
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,850
forked we cut library already and did

244
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,010
some bug fixes because no one else is

245
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,770
maintaining that those projects so maybe

246
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,589
someone can can

247
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,860
Arisa rectum there are also some outlook

248
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,949
object model issues differences between

249
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,529
the common objects outlook users and

250
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,060
that of net with the garbage collection

251
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,050
so we need to implement some rappers

252
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,509
iCalendar generally has more generic

253
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,910
data models or some properties can't be

254
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,079
mapped properly the you I should stay

255
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,449
responsive of course which is difficult

256
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:42,329
because outlook by designers and SDA

257
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:45,329
application and some stuff needs to be

258
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:47,329
done in the main thread and you

259
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,600
otherwise you lose your risk the data

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,800
loss of the internal map II object model

261
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,269
hem future work as already mentioned we

262
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,809
try to support more kinds of contact

263
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,970
groups here's an example of a extended

264
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,819
address book current group we card with

265
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,389
with group members we want to implement

266
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,329
collection sync report which should

267
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,180
speed up the initial synchronization

268
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,009
maybe there is even the possibility to

269
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,519
implement a suicide solution natively on

270
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,220
the exchange server we will support

271
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,769
attachment soon maybe it could be linked

272
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,720
to cloud storage for example next route

273
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,860
API would support that and a lot of

274
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,139
other ideas intent future tasks to do so

275
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,569
thank you very much you can find sources

276
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,670
and releases on github and and source

277
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,680
fortuned more information on our web

278
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,439
page and you see supported server

279
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:58,920
profiles just a few of them even more

280
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,990
supported of course thank you

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,930
thank you very much Alexander

282
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,330
unfortunately we're out of time but I

283
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,820
suggest you go to Alexander and ask your

284
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,530
questions personally but we need to get

285
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,690
set up for the next speaker so thank you

286
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,920
very much if you want to leave the room

287
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,080
please use the door on your left hand

288
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,990
side so people from rightand can enter

289
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,140
thank you
