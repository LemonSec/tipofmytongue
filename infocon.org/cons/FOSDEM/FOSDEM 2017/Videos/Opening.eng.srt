1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,200
okay good morning everyone

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,040
hi welcome to the second edition of the

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,590
HPC big data and data science the room

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,390
here at FOSDEM we are very happy to to

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,980
do this again after a very successful

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,820
event last year so this dev room is

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,810
organized by four people so Kenneth here

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,160
II won back in that in a video I Roman

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,380
on the other corner and myself

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,180
I'm Vasya so please please reach out to

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,370
us if you need anything like

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,500
organizational or administrative or if

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,930
you're a speaker and you haven't tried

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,610
if your laptop is working okay so this

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,440
year we have again a lot of submissions

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,280
I think 42 or 43 maybe a few late ones

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
and we tried our best to accept as many

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,890
as possible that's why all the all the

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,740
talks are short so we have 15 full talks

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,100
20 minute talks and 5 lightning talks in

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,030
the middle so as you will see this year

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,619
strands evolved I wrote a lot around

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,539
containers machine learning and

24
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:25,030
streaming a stream processing so in that

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,240
we've tried to somehow group the topics

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,399
together so in the beginning it's more

27
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,399
let's say related to HPC topics and then

28
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,729
gradually moving towards big data topics

29
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,429
through data science somehow like like

30
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:43,869
that so I hope you all enjoy you have an

31
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,420
exciting day I only have two requests

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,109
for you one is if there is an empty seat

33
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,029
next to you and you can squeeze so that

34
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,600
more people can see it please do and the

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,350
second is please use the feedback forums

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,969
on the website so if you go to the

37
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,069
schedule and you click on its stock then

38
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,469
underneath you will find a link where

39
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,020
you can give feedback so if you like the

40
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,300
talk or you didn't like the talk or if

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,740

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,950
