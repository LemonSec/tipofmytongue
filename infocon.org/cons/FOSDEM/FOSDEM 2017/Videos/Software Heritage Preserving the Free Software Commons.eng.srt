1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:21,960
you look like you like a CEO

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,720
although brothers

3
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,310
HUP

4
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,560
because time

5
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,820
okay should we go okay

6
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,310
so hi everybody it's a pleasure to be

7
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,890
here today I know dear to the cosmos

8
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,290
definite security you probably know us

9
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,650
for our long history in free software

10
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,930
before but we are here today extremely

11
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,790
excited to tell you about a new project

12
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,370
that is taking up basically all of our

13
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,920
energy it is called software heritage

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,670
and we are basically building the

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,250
Library of Alexandria or source code but

16
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,590
before going into the details let me

17
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,990
give you some motivation so if we look

18
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,020
around us we see software everywhere it

19
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,330
powers the digital transformation if

20
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,150
fools our innovation is an essential

21
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,210
component of modern research it's an

22
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,390
essential mediator for accessing digital

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,759
information in any shape and you feel

24
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,290
think about it to use it everybody

25
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,290
everywhere from communication

26
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,149
entertainment politics the way you are

27
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,370
organizing politics depends on software

28
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,459
so in some sense software embeds

29
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,430
embodies a significant part of our

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,880
knowledge in our cultural heritage but

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,860
as we know the rewear in our community

32
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,269
when you talk about software there is

33
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,040
one thing which is really the knowledge

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,250
and this thing is a source code and the

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,780
source code of the software which is a

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,200
very special object in human history if

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,330
you think about it it is human readable

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,750
executable knowledge which is a first

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,640
kind in in human history

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,709
how can an object like this one as

41
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,280
Harold Adelson who was a he's a

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,739
fantastic teacher he wrote a book I was

43
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,070
using Wiles was young and universally he

44
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,989
is also by the way one of the founder of

45
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,910
the free software foundation of Creative

46
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,670
Commons he used to say the computer

47
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,070
program should be written in the first

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,049
place for people to read and only

49
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,010
accessory for machines to execute they

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,180
should be I mean this is a

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,739
recommendation for students of course

52
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,970
and now if you look at the incredible

53
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,250
amount of free software which is around

54
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,070
now you have access to pieces of code

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,840
which are beautiful for example look at

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,459
the source code or the quake 2 game

57
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,220
which was

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,910
reduce the fish after many years ago

59
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,280
well it is not very readable here I do

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,170
suggest you go and read it over the

61
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,120
Internet there are fantastic pieces of

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,050
hackery

63
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,890
on how to make this 3d animation work on

64
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,330
machines which are not powerful enough

65
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,640
there are incredible tricks in the in

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,430
the Linux cabinet for example and to

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,050
understand what is really going on you

68
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,390
need to go in read the source and read

69
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,940
the comments that are in there as then

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,320
choose the quiz the founder of the

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,290
Computer History Museum says having

72
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,120
access to the source code of our

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,760
software is actually an incredible open

74
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,840
window in the mind of the designer if we

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,850
think a little bit about this a little

76
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,220
bit more I mean this is actually I mean

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,110
our free software are really the

78
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,420
software Commons our software Commons

79
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,149
but what are the Commons but the Commons

80
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,630
are basically resources which are

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,720
holding common that do not not owned by

82
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,750
anybody in particular but that everybody

83
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,760
can use freely we are use it to this in

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,210
economy air water some therapies if you

85
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,700
think about software Commons when this

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,550
is the software that is held in common

87
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,550
that everybody can reuse adapt and so

88
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,110
basically everything which is free and

89
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,540
open-source software is a software

90
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,510
commerce but unfortunately if you think

91
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,730
a little bit about it you know that from

92
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,560
economy when you have something which is

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
held in common you often have what is

94
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,750
called the tragedy of the Commons I mean

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,580
if you don't care about your comments if

96
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,050
you don't Northshore the common if you

97
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,880
don't cherish the common they will

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,030
identity the parish we know this that's

99
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,980
the reason why as a community we are

100
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,990
very active trying to maintain our

101
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,910
software make sure there is a community

102
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,010
taking care of it making it evolve

103
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,650
getting new people on board sharing our

104
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,840
principle in values that's very nice but

105
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,040
if you look at our source code I mean

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,870
this is really a piece of art of our

107
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,790
knowledge are we really doing everything

108
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,610
necessary to make sure it is maintained

109
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,640
over time well not really

110
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,760
there are a few issues that we need to

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,740
face one thing is that of course after

112
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,860
is everywhere that's positive but softly

113
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,080
is also spread all around and that's an

114
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,230
issue because we are actually using many

115
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,140
many different disparate platform for

116
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,270
developing software we are strongly

117
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,730
opinionated people so I use mine you use

118
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,220
yours everybody use their own treasured

119
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,560
development platform here in this tag

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,930
cloud I have just highlighted some names

121
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,550
that should ring a bell to what people

122
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,620
like me that used platform that more or

123
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,900
less disappear today another name that

124
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,940
should ring a bell to modern people that

125
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,070
use very volume platform that are very

126
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,110
useful and who knows where they will be

127
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,990
in 10 years ok but so not only we have

128
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,390
many development platforms we also have

129
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,750
many places where we distribute the

130
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,210
resulting software somebody uses a

131
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,130
development platform to they will switch

132
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,770
the software somebody uses archives many

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,570
many different things and to make

134
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,040
matters worse over time projects migrate

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,470
so you start it in one place then you

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,900
move it to another if you do your

137
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,030
homework well you usually should close

138
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,040
your one and put in your admission the

139
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,870
new one is there but not everybody does

140
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,080
it I mean so it's not easy to follow the

141
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,630
evolution of an apartment software in a

142
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,760
word what we are sorely missing is a

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,660
single place where you can actually have

144
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,030
a global addition of all the software

145
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,770
which is available what we need is a

146
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,170
place where you can really find track

147
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,390
and search all the source code no matter

148
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,910
where and how it has been developed and

149
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,150
no matter where and how it has been

150
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,480
distributed

151
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,270
so that's issue number one but then you

152
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,180
have issue number two which is our

153
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,950
source code which is software is

154
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,740
actually fragile maybe we don't notice

155
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,750
when maybe a lot of people now notice

156
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,850
after what happened four years ago but I

157
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,890
mean we will come to back to that a

158
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,390
little bit later on

159
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,920
of course you know digital information

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,200
is fragile you can you can have

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,690
accidents your server can break down you

162
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,130
can have an earthquake you cannot have a

163
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,430
fire you can make mistakes

164
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,730
I mean who never actually hit FM -

165
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,430
arrived him the wrong directory raise

166
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,110
your hand if you didn't do it

167
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,950
sure sure I know okay these kind of

168
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,800
things this is well known but then more

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,020
recently you see different kind of

170
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,990
problems which are malicious attack

171
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,480
somebody hacking into your system and

172
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,040
just removing everything if you don't

173
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,490
ship 150,000 euros in bitcoins to some

174
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,140
specific account so this is very

175
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,200
fashionable lately but more recently we

176
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,180
have discovered that there is an even

177
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,660
greater danger which is basically

178
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,070
business decisions okay in mid-2015 when

179
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,909
victorious were bought out in a few

180
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,780
weeks more than 100000 repository had to

181
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,440
find a new place when Google Code was

182
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,690
shut down more or less in the memo in

183
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,600
the same moment over 1 million and a

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,280
half repositories had to migrate as well

185
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,530
ok so this is new we were not used to

186
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,870
this kind of situation so what we are

187
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,670
really really missing today

188
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,550
is an archive a real archive that has a

189
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,380
mission of preserving the content

190
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,010
written in its mission as a place where

191
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,120
you can go over repository goes away

192
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,490
repository was on github or github or if

193
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,990
the platform that you are using for

194
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,360
doing development goes away or has

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,980
failed backups and the third question is

196
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,780
if you look at the software we are

197
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,520
developing now there is an incredible

198
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,080
amount of chakra which is available for

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,230
everybody to study to understand to look

200
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,470
at and we have many things to do

201
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,990
automatic analysis began Alice's trend

202
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,980
analysis very vulnerability detection on

203
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,190
Sandra Dee's well our friends in physics

204
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,350
know very well for this kind of big

205
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,260
challenges you need serious instruments

206
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,610
to look into this kind of object but

207
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,620
today

208
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,050
we should copy what people do in physics

209
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,150
I mean build a large telescope to look

210
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,980
at the Stars where is the large

211
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,710
telescope to look the tower source code

212
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,850
and study it understand how it adores so

213
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,120
these are just three issues we face and

214
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,580
we need to take action so you take

215
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,940
action now we've started with death

216
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,260
enough quite quite quite a long time ago

217
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,270
I mean if it was undercover for a while

218
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,520
a project which is called software

219
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,150
heritage that has the precise mission of

220
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,370
discovery in stone our mission is not to

221
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,710
become rich is not to become famous our

222
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,400
mission is to collect organize preserve

223
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,430
and share all of the source code which

224
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,830
is publicly available and we want to do

225
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,320
it because it is important to preserve

226
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,660
the old source code of course but it

227
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,760
isn't more important to have a single

228
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,060
place where you can actually study and

229
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,680
enhance the software we are building

230
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,510
today to prepare for a better future

231
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,910
later on ok and now how would you do

232
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,460
some here this that's a nice motivation

233
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,050
let's see let's see what these guys

234
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,690
actually do but first of all you sit

235
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,400
down and try to think about what the

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,140
best way of organizing project like this

237
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,190
one so one idea is to take a little bit

238
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,290
of unique philosophy so let's do one

239
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,350
thing and do one thing well so what we

240
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,890
want to build is really really a common

241
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,470
infrastructure a common platform that

242
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,320
only cares about this source code and

243
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,130
then on top of this we want to enable

244
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,010
other people to develop a wealth of

245
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,920
application that can be related to

246
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,180
cultural heritage to industry to

247
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,190
research to education just just to give

248
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,050
a couple of examples about what you can

249
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,070
do if you have a universal residence

250
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,950
catalog of all the software has been

251
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,320
built with all of the history of its

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,070
development

253
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,140
ok the kind of analysis kind of study

254
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,480
you can do that other ways of building

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,850
subjects you can develop for research

256
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,560
having a single place where research

257
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,230
software can actually be put and reused

258
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,160
other people who care about

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,290
reproducibility for people doing

260
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,840
research on softer having a single place

261
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,420
where in a uniform way everything is

262
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,010
available to perform your research in a

263
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,780
repeatable way and there are many many

264
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,520
other application we don't want to do it

265
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,920
we want to enable it I mean it's an

266
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,650
infrastructure for doing all this but

267
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,900
that's not an easy task

268
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,430
how can you sustain such a project how

269
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,830
can you organize such a project so we

270
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,530
have two basic principle first of all of

271
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,330
course coming from the community which

272
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,660
is ours it's evident we want to have

273
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,000
everything as open-source software

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,340
100% of all the development of the

275
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,750
infrastructure we are building is

276
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,340
available as free and open source

277
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,360
software but also we highly value

278
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,350
transparency we do not believe we have

279
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,360
the strongest in the world and we take

280
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,250
decision it will be the best one we want

281
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,350
to have other people coming and working

282
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,630
with us to find the best way of making

283
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,100
progress and on the other side we are

284
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,110
really here for the wrong code I mean it

285
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,700
will take time to build such an

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,440
infrastructure it will take time to make

287
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,230
it sustainable over time and the only

288
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,600
solution to make sure this project will

289
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,040
last over time is to use basic

290
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,500
principles of reliability engineering

291
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,020
which is basically replication events or

292
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,840
replication at all levels we should not

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,610
just have a copy of our data ourselves

294
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,550
it should create a network of mirrors

295
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,340
that make copies in other places in

296
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,080
other countries and their different

297
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,720
registration possibly using different

298
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
technology to make sure if one node

299
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
disappears others will be there but it

300
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,160
also means a replication in terms of

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,650
contribution so not just having a single

302
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,170
company or startup running this now we

303
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,990
want to build a nonprofit

304
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,950
multi-stakeholder organization where

305
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,960
many people with different reason of

306
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,570
being the country boot to make it viable

307
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,940
and you see since we have people from

308
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,650
cultural heritage which are interested

309
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,300
in foreign industry for researcher from

310
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,490
education we do hope to bring around the

311
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,170
table many people coming from different

312
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,750
places for different reasons and they

313
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,020
should never go away altogether I do not

314
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,240
want to see again a single manager that

315
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,910
said in but what this project I had here

316
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,550
let's let's catch it okay we and then

317
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,560
you have to move another mini repository

318
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,850
somewhere else so all of this is nice

319
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,580
and fine it is a high level vision of

320
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,680
what I am doing now I think you are

321
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,200
curious to know what we are doing

322
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,460
technically

323
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,790
inside how far we went and is this just

324
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,460
slide where I am that aware or is this

325
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,370
actually software and hardware running

326
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,380
and here intersessional

327
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,140
who will give you a very nice view what

328
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,870
is going on Thanks so let's dive into

329
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,460
the specifics of what we are doing and

330
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,340
how we are doing it so first of all what

331
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,740
we do actually archive and what is in

332
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,780
the scope of our archival mission so we

333
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,150
go after places where we know we will

334
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,830
find source code and specifically

335
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,840
publicly available source code and so

336
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,490
what we go after practically are

337
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,380
publicly available version control

338
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,570
system as well as source code

339
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,730
distribution artifacts such as tarballs

340
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,090
or distribution sauce packages and when

341
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,850
we find those places what we retrieve

342
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,130
from those places are actual file

343
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,470
content I also known as blobs we call

344
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,120
these content objects we were three

345
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,520
comets because we clear winter we we

346
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,960
think that source code itself is very

347
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,190
important but the eastery of its

348
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,140
development is important as well as

349
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,870
knowledge that tells you why specific

350
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,700
changes has been made in a specific

351
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,710
piece of code so we archive all commits

352
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,020
that we find that we call revisions with

353
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,820
all their metadata so commit messages

354
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
auto information information about which

355
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,780
where the the previous commits so on and

356
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,290
so forth

357
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,600
we archive releases that is specifically

358
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,270
unnoted commits that author consider to

359
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,550
be worthwhile for our specific software

360
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,200
lives with a given name and a given

361
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,420
version number and we archive for all

362
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,000
those information where the information

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
about where we have found it which we

364
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,150
call software origins and when we have

365
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,370
founded so for each object we add to our

366
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,950
archive we not we know down we had seen

367
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,110
that in that specific repository or in

368
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,420
that specific distribution packages at

369
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,600
that specific time all this is stored in

370
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,030
a canonical model which I'll describe in

371
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,240
a

372
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,220
bit in more detail but is which is

373
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,110
independent of specific version control

374
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,209
system technology or packaging

375
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,339
representation so different VCS

376
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:37,930
different distribution packages all

377
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,570
stored in the same model what we do not

378
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,790
archive for now at least trying to focus

379
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,010
on doing one thing for the moment is we

380
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,620
don't store on page website of project

381
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,230
wiki's witnessed or backtracking system

382
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,290
information or issues or the history of

383
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,120
code reviews for instance and we don't

384
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,220
store mailing lists so for now is to

385
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,200
focus on a single mission but in the

386
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,940
medium long term our idea is that we

387
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,279
basically should play one role in a more

388
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,859
general semantic Wikipedia of software

389
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,990
where the information we store will be

390
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,510
put in will be linked to store

391
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,280
information stored by other people other

392
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,439
archiving initiatives by saying at the

393
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,839
time that source code was archived well

394
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,240
the website of the corresponding project

395
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,829
looked like this and the same you can

396
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,829
imagine for issues for bugs and for code

397
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,290
reviews and so on and so forth so this

398
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,900
is what we actually archive and how does

399
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,020
it work so it's a pretty standard search

400
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,990
engine like architecture implementers

401
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,270
the two-tier process so on the left here

402
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,179
you have all the places where source

403
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,100
code can be found so you can imagine the

404
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,160
major centralized hosting platforms you

405
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,559
can imagine is specific instances of

406
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,900
awesome platform you can deploy yourself

407
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,210
on-premise you can imagine distribution

408
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,340
with their source code packages and you

409
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,170
can imagine imagine the specific

410
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,980
repository that exists behind

411
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,179
language-specific package manager for

412
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,850
instance and all those conceptual places

413
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,640
are processed by a component components

414
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,950
that we call Lister's and what they do

415
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,350
is they they go after a specific forge

416
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,800
and can do either complete full listing

417
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,750
of all the repositories available there

418
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,330
or incremental listings saying something

419
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,580
like what new repository have been

420
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,440
created since the last time I've been

421
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,720
there and the result of those Lister's

422
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,510
are stored in our database as points

423
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,429
which we call software origin and each

424
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,860
point is actually a single repository or

425
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,020
a single package so you can imagine here

426
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,360
that for any repository on github or

427
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,250
bitbucket we have created a data point

428
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,990
with a canonical URL where we can

429
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,800
retrieve code

430
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,170
and we keep that in mind for future

431
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,930
processing with the second tier of this

432
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,150
process this happened periodically okay

433
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,220
and we what we developed in terms of

434
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,650
code is a specific Lister for every

435
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,540
specific hosting place so we will have

436
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,480
us Lister for github one for a bit

437
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,580
packet one for get lab and for get lab

438
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,860
this Lister will list different grid lab

439
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,050
instances available out there so this

440
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,560
step one it is now a pool model so we

441
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,970
periodically redo that but in theory

442
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,980
could also be push when we received

443
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,890
notification from partnership partner in

444
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,780
austen platforms about the new events

445
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,450
and the second step is periodic as well

446
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,330
and is actually loading so we go after

447
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,000
any specific software origin we have

448
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
stored here and use a loader component

449
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,590
to retrieve all the content that is

450
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,510
available from that repository for

451
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,490
instance so we retrieve all the comments

452
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,920
all the revisions all the blobs and what

453
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,160
we do we add that to our archive

454
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,320
duplicating everything globally so when

455
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,910
we find a new commit in a specific

456
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,160
apposite ori we check whether we have

457
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,810
already archived that commit for

458
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,120
instance from a different repository and

459
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
we add it to the archive only if it that

460
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,550
the first time that we have seen ok so

461
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,280
this model is the canonical model in

462
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,600
which we store everything where we

463
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,100
everything is essentially stored only

464
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,780
once duplicated and is implemented as a

465
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,550
two different conceptual parts as on

466
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,280
merkel dog and a blob storage so for

467
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
those of you that might not be familiar

468
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,260
with what american structure is is that

469
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,330
structure that might be a tree a list or

470
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,100
a dog as in our case which is

471
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,410
essentially ash of ashes so each node in

472
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,540
these structures as an identifier which

473
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,400
is not chosen by you when you add stuff

474
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,340
but its intrinsic so the identifier of a

475
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,500
given node is computed by the content of

476
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,480
the node itself and by the identifier of

477
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,580
the node that have been that are point

478
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,890
by these specific nodes is a very

479
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,870
specific very common cryptography

480
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,690
construction that you find in a lot of

481
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,280
technology these days you find it the

482
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,930
basis of gate you find it in block

483
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,940
chains we find it in ipfs it's very

484
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,590
popular and it has some very nice

485
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,750
properties for instance it allows to

486
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,420
compare to a huge structure very quick

487
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,060
if they if they defer in only some

488
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,890
specific places because for instance if

489
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,380
the route identifier of two huge grass

490
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,750
of two huge trees are the same you know

491
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,670
that the entire content of the trees are

492
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,250
the same assuming that it's the data

493
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,810
structure is consistent and also of

494
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,340
course it's supposed built in the

495
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,720
duplication because when you add

496
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,270
something it has a predefined identifier

497
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,340
based on its content and so if the node

498
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,090
is already there

499
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,740
you just don't store an additional copy

500
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,920
of it anymore so we use this in the dag

501
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,230
violent because in commit history you

502
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,930
might have actually known three sub

503
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,080
structures and an example of with the

504
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,910
kind of nodes we have in our archive

505
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,100
this is a revision node it's a commit

506
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,110
which has been done actually on our own

507
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,690
Forge by Nicola which is one of our

508
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,630
fellow engineers and all the information

509
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,330
of the the commits so the the tree the

510
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,280
directory that existed at the time when

511
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,620
it was committed the parent commit the

512
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,570
author the committer which might differ

513
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,490
if you have someone else pushing the

514
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,380
code yet you've committed yourself the

515
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,840
commit message is used to compute the ID

516
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,140
of the node and that ID will be the ID

517
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,810
we have in our archive for this specific

518
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,460
node so in passing I know that our IDs

519
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,200
for now are compatible with get itself

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,420
it's not a long term decide decision but

521
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,130
given the popularity of gate it's a good

522
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,670
property to have today so if you have

523
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,290
object ID is coming from gate you can

524
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,450
use them directly to check if something

525
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,500
is present in our archive or not so that

526
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,510
was a specific node the conceptual

527
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,610
structure of our archive as a whole is

528
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,340
then a huge graph in which you have

529
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,950
blobs here so those are the individual

530
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,690
content of files without their names

531
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,880
just the identify by the ash of their

532
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,850
content you have directories pointing to

533
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,950
blood you have commit these are the

534
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,630
directory structures okay

535
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,060
these are the vision so the commit

536
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,770
history which are usually chained

537
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,960
together in a long history starting from

538
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,450
the oldest commit to the most recent one

539
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,670
with the branches and merges in there

540
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,470
and you have releases which are

541
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,620
specifically unnoted commits declared by

542
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,140
the developer as important commits

543
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,490
corresponding to software releases and

544
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,039
you have snapshots just

545
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,590
just Rd essentially the pictures we take

546
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,289
of a given i+ when we find it noting

547
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,139
down where each branch or each tag were

548
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:19,379
pointing to at a time in terms of this

549
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,659
is a conceptual view in terms of actual

550
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,720
technology this is implemented as a very

551
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,450
simple object stored here which we have

552
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,059
developed in-house it's all Python 3 and

553
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,619
there isn't why we've developed one in

554
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,539
house for now is that we don't want to

555
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,909
impose any specific technology to people

556
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,489
who might want to mirror our archive but

557
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,989
there is no reason why couldn't have

558
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:43,080
backends for your favorite distributed

559
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,029
object storage and everything else is

560
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,009
essentially the graph structure without

561
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,440
the final payload of the files it's

562
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,729
actually implemented as a Postgres

563
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,830
database there too it's been working

564
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,749
very well for us up to now there is no

565
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,340
reason why cannot be great in the future

566
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,720
should different structure which are

567
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,059
well suited to store graphs but this is

568
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,059
pretty big so we were skeptical that

569
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,669
many technology for storing smaller

570
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,559
graphs would be applicable here

571
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,979
so conceptual view of their kyv what is

572
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:12,749
actually in there today this is

573
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,479
implemented and it's been in mirroring a

574
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,739
lot of source code and source code

575
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:20,009
related artifacts in the past month so

576
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:23,039
in their network ID you will find a full

577
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,470
mirror of the public part of github

578
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,269
which is maintained periodically up to

579
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:30,179
date you will find all the history of

580
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,399
sauce packets uploaded to debian between

581
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,059
2005 and 2015 which we have injected one

582
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,210
off as a Trier as a dry run but we will

583
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,739
be put in production and the periodic

584
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,529
updates in the next few months similarly

585
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,239
we have an ingestion of all the

586
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,710
terrible's released by the GNU project

587
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:53,279
up to August 2015 again one of run which

588
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,559
will be putting production regularly

589
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,229
soon and we have locally retrieved a

590
00:24:58,229 --> 00:24:59,999
full copy of all the repository for

591
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,799
Kotori from guitar use thanks to

592
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,929
collaboration with their kyv team and a

593
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,580
full copy of all the repository that

594
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,590
were available on on Google code

595
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,879
thanks to collaboration with Google

596
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:12,119
themselves so this is not yet injected

597
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,830
in the archive itself we have local

598
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,090
copies what we are in the process of

599
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,419
injecting them for instance most of the

600
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,559
subversion repositories we were three

601
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,909
from Google code have been already

602
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:21,720
ingested in our

603
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,570
five and we have to finish that soon in

604
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,770
the next few months in terms of find all

605
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,260
the number you see here are unique

606
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,540
objects because we duplicate everything

607
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,210
so we have three billion different

608
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,550
unique files and I mean unique file

609
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,040
content with that we have something like

610
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,490
700 million commits and all this is

611
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,650
coming from a bit more than 50 million

612
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,390
software origins so you can imagine

613
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,920
software origin from now as either

614
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,470
packages or these are version less

615
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,150
packages or you get or SVN repository we

616
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,820
clone and we were type code from on disk

617
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,340
is something like 150 terabytes

618
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,810
for the blob store which of course

619
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,240
donates completely the disk occupation

620
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,340
and a six terabyte database for the

621
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,830
graph if you think of it as a graph is a

622
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,990
pretty significant structure it's a

623
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,820
graph which has about 5 billion nodes

624
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,930
and 50 billion

625
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,610
edges among the nodes so it's a pretty

626
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,330
significant graph in itself we have

627
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,130
reason to believe that this is already

628
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,520
the richest source code archive in

629
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,650
existence and as you can see from the

630
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,140
grow graph it's growing daily so what

631
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,700
you can do with that so starting today

632
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,710
as a token of gratitude for all the

633
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,720
communities being here at FOSDEM and all

634
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
you do for free software we're opening

635
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,940
up our public API so you can find all

636
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,370
the details about our public API at that

637
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,590
URL I should apologize in advance

638
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,230
because it's not yet available via ipv6

639
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,580
we are in discussion with our

640
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,040
institutional network provider to give

641
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,980
us ipv6 weeks v6 blocks so this will

642
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,670
hopefully be fixed in the next few weeks

643
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,260
ok so please bear with us until then and

644
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,200
use the FOSDEM ancient network here if

645
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,450
you want access it what you can do with

646
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,790
that API you can essentially browse the

647
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,920
content of there Kyle has a point wise

648
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,100
graph structure so you can jump from one

649
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,140
object to another following the links in

650
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,030
the graph so for instance you can jump

651
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,530
from releases to the point that

652
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,630
revisions the point and director is down

653
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,850
to the file count and you have full

654
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,430
access for four of the entire meta data

655
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,260
for any objects you are visiting

656
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,870
ok additionally you have access to all

657
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,820
the coding information so you can do

658
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,290
queries like when have you last visited

659
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,460
this specific

660
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,470
git repositories that I care about okay

661
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,740
or given a specific visit to have done

662
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,350
on a git repository where where each all

663
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,570
those branches that I have pointing to

664
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,880
at a time so it's a sort of Wayback

665
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,270
Machine for your git and repositories

666
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,000
and your source code releases you have a

667
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,240
full endpoint index available and linked

668
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,490
from the main API documentation but just

669
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,649
to give you an overview this is a full

670
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:04,649
story you can follow with with our API

671
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,750
let's assume you are a developer of

672
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,080
Highland which is a lispy dialect

673
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,230
implemented in Python you can ask what

674
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,500
is the origin identifier for that

675
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,110
repository given the canonical URL of

676
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,970
the repository clone from so you have

677
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,520
this endpoint here Hajin you give it the

678
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,010
type of origin you give it the URL of

679
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,100
the clone URL and we will answer you

680
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,140
with the ID of the origin so this is

681
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,510
origin ID number one equipped with the

682
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,600
origin number you can jump to the list

683
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,580
of visits and we'll return you a list of

684
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,140
all the visits we have done

685
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,020
specifically visit number 13 has been

686
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,970
done at this timestamp which is a few

687
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,470
months ago I believe is something like

688
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,289
September 2016 and it will give you the

689
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,480
URL where you'll find more details but

690
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,520
that specific visit so you jump to that

691
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,330
and you will find a huge mapping of all

692
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,059
the branches and tags or rafts and get

693
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,159
terminology and where they were pointing

694
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,020
to at a time so for instance master

695
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,510
branch we're pointing to the target

696
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,809
commit be 94 etc which is actually a

697
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:10,710
revision

698
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,630
okay a commit and we'll give you the URL

699
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,220
to know more about that objects a

700
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,070
different tag the relay is 0 10 0 was

701
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,740
pointing to a release object which and

702
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,419
gives you the URL of that release object

703
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,250
so you drill down for instance I've

704
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,380
followed this release and if I found out

705
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,760
the Committee was pointing to and you

706
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,250
will arrive at this vision number which

707
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,720
will tell you all the information about

708
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,240
that specific commit so that commit was

709
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,279
done by our friend Paul which is one of

710
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,860
the maintainer of hyaline will tell you

711
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,750
information about the date of the commit

712
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,179
the date of the the committed date it

713
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,860
might be different general and will

714
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,230
point you to the director so the root

715
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,450
directory associated to that commit and

716
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,670
you can continue

717
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,410
you can give you a four you can we'll

718
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,690
give you also the commit message or that

719
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,720
specific revision and you can follow the

720
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,210
directory structure down to specific

721
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,490
content objects okay when you arrive at

722
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,350
a content object you have the

723
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,360
information about all the checks and we

724
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,670
compute for the contents which is the

725
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,300
sha-1 the sha-1 gate and sha-256 okay

726
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,230
and we'll give you additional

727
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,340
information which is still

728
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,040
work-in-progress focus like detected

729
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,180
information like the file type the

730
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,280
language type and the license type

731
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,070
devices we have detected the Foley file

732
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,260
and it will give you also a link to the

733
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,450
content of the file itself for download

734
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,730
so a couple of caveats apply here in

735
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,910
addition to not having ipv6 so we have a

736
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,530
rate limits that apply throughout the

737
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,880
API that are pretty they are pretty

738
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,250
severe for now you can do 120 requests

739
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,280
per hour and blob download so the actual

740
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,050
access to the file itself is not

741
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,730
available yet this is because we are

742
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,710
focusing our resources on developing and

743
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,870
adding new features to their kind rather

744
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,270
than in putting energy in keeping up our

745
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,130
infrastructure to offer this as a public

746
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,110
service for everyone but we are open to

747
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,820
help in case you have resources to offer

748
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,790
to actually lift those restriction in

749
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,760
the future so zooming out a little bit

750
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
this is a specific thing we're releasing

751
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,360
today which is navigation of their

752
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,610
Chiron API we had already released in

753
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,900
the past a very simple feature

754
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,390
accessible from our main website which

755
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,090
will allow you to just drag-and-drop

756
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,340
tarballs or set of files to see which of

757
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,160
those five every archive and in the

758
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,780
future who will be working on a proper

759
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,900
web UI okay for the equivalent of the

760
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,070
API for a web browser users will we will

761
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,300
look of course in allowing you to

762
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,510
download code from as tarballs or as get

763
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,580
bundles for instance and this is will be

764
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
hopefully available next few months and

765
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,510
adding provenance information telling

766
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,550
you where we have seen all the places

767
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,440
where we have found a specific object or

768
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,780
specific comment and full text search of

769
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,830
course because it's really interesting

770
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,810
to once read this archive it's super

771
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,220
interesting to be able to do full text

772
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,040
search of all of it and much more so

773
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,750
once we have this archive really the

774
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,980
disguise the limit of what you can

775
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,280
imagine and you can help okay so the

776
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,570
most of the people here are free

777
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,340
software enthusiasts and their coders so

778
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,470
this is run as a first understand

779
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,390
free software projects we have our own

780
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,220
forage we have developed information we

781
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,720
have a mailing list we have an IRC

782
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,179
channel and all our code is available

783
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,490
it's free software on our Forge which is

784
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,620
a fabricator instance which we which we

785
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,419
love in case you're interested in

786
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,030
contributing so these are some of our

787
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,460
top development priorities so of course

788
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,240
we need to add more Lister's for forges

789
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,610
out there that we don't track yet and

790
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,309
each type of different force will need a

791
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:32,840
specific Lister

792
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,270
we need loaders for VCS and package

793
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,820
format that we don't support yet we need

794
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,480
the web UI itself which we we have a

795
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,820
prototype but it's not ready to be

796
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,500
released as a product yet and of course

797
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,539
there is the ample opportunity of

798
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,789
working on indexing content that it is

799
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,710
in there kyv with whatever indexer you

800
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,110
can imagine so but of course all coding

801
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,850
all contributions are welcome so just

802
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,860
follow our development channels show up

803
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,919
on our Forge talk with us and we'll find

804
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,600
there's definitely something you can do

805
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,159
that match your interest and that will

806
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,350
help us in our mission and of course you

807
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,760
can also join us so we have

808
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,130
opportunities for students both on

809
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,990
development topics and on the research

810
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,789
topics and we have actually an open

811
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,470
position right now for people who want

812
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,230
to work on the our Web API or our web UI

813
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,030
sorry and they are available at the

814
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,309
listen from this address WC on the sly

815
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,710
thanks ed of stiffener for this in-depth

816
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,140
presentation over here doing back to the

817
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,760
old guy that brings again the

818
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,039
institutional point of view here you see

819
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,809
there is interesting technology going on

820
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:43,070
here and it's an extremely exciting

821
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,140
technical project to do this it's really

822
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,730
not easier it's a lot of work and here

823
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,679
you see a picture of four people's from

824
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,909
me the left Oh

825
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:58,760
Stefano there Nicola Antoine okay so

826
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,620
these four guys have been working like

827
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,470
crazy from the last two years I would

828
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,990
say I'm more or less to try to bring

829
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,230
together this first initial part of the

830
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,290
project clearly we do not pretend to do

831
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,780
this alone we will never succeed doing

832
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,000
this alone so what is very important for

833
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,949
us is to make sure there is a community

834
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,859
around it so the first step in building

835
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,219
this community was to get support from a

836
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,199
nation and instantly search institution

837
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,040
which is in RIA

838
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,480
in France I don't know how many of you

839
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,820
know it but it's a fantastic place which

840
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,168
is a research center fully dedicated to

841
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:38,659
computer science that has already shown

842
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,969
in the past that they had a strong

843
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,770
culture in Finn open source software

844
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,359
there are a lot of contribution coming

845
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:47,239
from there and also they are willing to

846
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,339
do something which is special that is to

847
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,129
say help creating new institution they

848
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:54,139
were one of the founding partners of the

849
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,530
w3c over 20 years ago and they are ready

850
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,589
to do this again they have a put already

851
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,630
on the table got a lot of resources and

852
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,000
energy we are in their office space we

853
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
are using their infrastructure we are

854
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,050
using their services for a lot of things

855
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,060
and so this gives us security for the

856
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,580
next few years but again it's not enough

857
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,530
we need to bring a lot of people more

858
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,480
people around and so we have been

859
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,930
talking we have been talking to

860
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,779
laughs now super down the world telling

861
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:30,819
them what we are doing getting mine

862
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:33,220
share getting super so all the people in

863
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,869
this fist are actually supporting the

864
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,569
project I am sure you will recognize her

865
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,329
name and the red ones here in the first

866
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:42,759
lines are actually people who make a

867
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,880
step more by actually providing real

868
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,609
resources these resources can be money

869
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,890
we needed to hire people to after new

870
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,430
job for example it can be infrastructure

871
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,460
it can be connection with the research

872
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,220
networks etc so you discover some usual

873
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,440
suspects in the in the IT industry but

874
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,599
you have also people from research

875
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,589
organizations from other places in

876
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:13,450
society like banks for example please

877
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,609
please if you have connection with these

878
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,380
people and these people can come and

879
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,450
fell it's very important to have them

880
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,140
around the table as we have said so to

881
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,230
conclude we do hope we manage to

882
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,450
convince you that software age here is a

883
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,700
very exciting new project that has a

884
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,660
clear mission which is not just another

885
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,819
project but something which is really at

886
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,710
the service of our community and through

887
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,989
this whole set the service was society

888
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,999
at the world we are very open to

889
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,430
collaboration its core of our values and

890
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,220
we try to do everything possible to make

891
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,200
it easy to adapt it for other people to

892
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,099
come so you have connection parts to the

893
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,200
project that can be institutional if you

894
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,779
want to just give money or resources

895
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:01,150
that can are more traditional in

896
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,499
community if you want to collaborate

897
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:04,660
with us becoming in touch if you want to

898
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,960
provide time brain knowledge everything

899
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,789
is really open to collaboration you know

900
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:11,529
it's not easy creating a community

901
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,079
around the project takes time but as I

902
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,930
always say it's not just a destination

903
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,660
it's a journey but which is important

904
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,769
and so I believe we should see more

905
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,319
people coming and try to work together

906
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:29,289
on this project is not just our project

907
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,900
it is our project is a community so I

908
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,359
think I will stop here and we all thank

909
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:37,619
you very much for your attention

910
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,289
I have a bunch of questions the first

911
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,119
one is about software that was written

912
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,809
in Det that wasn't open source where the

913
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,670
company that wrote the software died

914
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,079
like I'm thinking about something like

915
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,990
visicalc they they wrote something that

916
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,930
was the first stride sheet you don't

917
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,160
have the source work you don't have the

918
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,280
source code or you guys open up on doing

919
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,440
stuff that the archive.org people are

920
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,150
doing which is reverse engineering these

921
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,859
things to get the source code and

922
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,609
archive it or you you have issues with

923
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,799
the legal part of it and are thinking

924
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,049
that these pieces of software are dead

925
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,630
in long gone that's my first question

926
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,539
and my second question is you have

927
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,270
hundred and fifty terabytes of data how

928
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,680
do you maintain that on the long-term

929
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,720
knowing that for NASA for instance their

930
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,619
their image system they have cartridges

931
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,780
and it takes them seven years to copy

932
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,000
the complete archive to a new system and

933
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
when they're done copying the new system

934
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,260
is obsolete already what's your plan for

935
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,250
that thank you

936
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,010
okay thanks to the inquest interesting

937
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,650
questions one thing is is there kind

938
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,599
open only to free and open source

939
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,539
software also to other source code and

940
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,369
what about software for which we do not

941
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,410
have source code again UNIX philosophy

942
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,319
we focus exact in only on collecting

943
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,210
storing concern in the source code so

944
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,250
it's not our business to do that as

945
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,569
engineering or something which can

946
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:09,369
result but if you do the worst

947
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:10,869
engineering and you have the digger

948
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:14,380
right for depositing it that's okay okay

949
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,799
we get

950
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,230
yes yes they know

951
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,890
yeah but that they mostly so you said

952
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,970
that there is a part of archive.org

953
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,190
doing a reverse engineering and posting

954
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,010
the result of the reverse engineering

955
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,060
bit in the question because you didn't

956
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,770
have a mic ok so again but in the point

957
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,780
is to to provide an infrastructure that

958
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,670
can store this is this kind of source

959
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,400
code and all initiatives that can

960
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,710
provide new contents are welcome but we

961
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,410
are bound again by legal issues as you

962
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,340
said so we can only access software that

963
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,380
we can copy so for example of course you

964
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,150
will find in their case soft which is

965
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,020
not free software our basic requirements

966
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,620
is that we can copy it and then somebody

967
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,900
can do something useful they didn't list

968
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,880
the minimal useful things you can do

969
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,890
with software as you see very well and

970
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,740
intro study read it even just reading it

971
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,870
that's enough for us that that will come

972
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,090
in that was question under 1 this

973
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,430
question number 2 is long term

974
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,780
reliability of all this again as I said

975
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,220
the designation is important but we are

976
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,510
in the middle of the journey we are not

977
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,540
there yet so for now the sides of the

978
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,880
archive is not so impressive after all

979
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,440
and it's very costly if you want to

980
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,570
maintain it yourself but if you look at

981
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,670
all the movies or cats which are

982
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,640
uploaded by my kids every year now and

983
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,100
it's not the YouTube size it's big but

984
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,040
it's not using ourselves and so there is

985
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,020
this issue of really really long term

986
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,740
preservation

987
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,660
I do believe much more you network on

988
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,490
mirrors and this Disney wrote using

989
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,560
different technologies but one thing we

990
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,570
are doing we are talking to libraries

991
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,060
for example and these libraries had a

992
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,310
mission to have kibe digital content

993
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,410
specifically given to Jesus on etc and

994
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,900
they had a very structured process to

995
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,670
actually make copy to tapes and make

996
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,620
sure these tapes are changed that when

997
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,690
the technology changes the theta ok not

998
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,880
our main mission right here but again

999
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,830
collaboration with other entities they

1000
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,830
try to do this and we are starting

1001
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,190
making these connections

1002
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,690
I have a question here in your age yes

1003
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,110
I'm standing up here ok thanks hey it's

1004
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,240
a two-fold question it's related to the

1005
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,940
right to be forgotten and also two

1006
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,860
problems that you can create when people

1007
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,510
don't want their quotes to be public

1008
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,170
anymore

1009
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,510
so like happened to me a few months ago

1010
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,240
some crazy community somewhere in Asia

1011
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,980
India I don't know decided that they

1012
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,810
were unhappy with the site and they

1013
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,020
attack the site put it down so do you

1014
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,120
have any thought about the idea of

1015
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,280
people not wanting it to be free anymore

1016
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,890
or if it offends someone or a community

1017
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,780
the fact that is free I don't know

1018
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,360
something in the sense of a way out of

1019
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,990
your of your solution right so of course

1020
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,320
we will abide to the law or regulation

1021
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,780
that apply where the software is Austin

1022
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,400
which right now also in France and in

1023
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Europe I believe we have the most strict

1024
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,580
regulation on the right to be forgotten

1025
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,670
and whatnot so what we will do is that

1026
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,590
we already have a legal page information

1027
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,780
on our website and if there is any

1028
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,550
applicable law either for what you

1029
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,200
mention or for you know copyright

1030
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,330
infringement we will just hide the

1031
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,340
content so the content will no longer be

1032
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,380
available for download we will keep a

1033
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,690
copy of it if the law allows us to do so

1034
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,000
so for instance if the rights expire one

1035
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,680
day we will be able to distribute it

1036
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,300
again which does not back to your case

1037
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,490
of course but might apply to other law

1038
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:52,520
regulations so I had a I made a couple

1039
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,120
of notes that about your data model

1040
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,160
there like details but you're going to

1041
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,360
have to change the data model

1042
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,460
occasionally you obviously going to want

1043
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,480
to change to a different hash function

1044
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,500
what's your do you have like a

1045
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,390
transition plan for how to how to

1046
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,900
upgrade from old to new with more data

1047
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,970
in the commit objects or whatever right

1048
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,160
so we are already resistant to sha-1

1049
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,960
collision because I didn't show the

1050
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,000
details but for blobs you are computing

1051
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,040
three kind of ashes and we have unique

1052
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,200
indexes on each of them so we will spot

1053
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,030
if there is a sha-1 collision but of

1054
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,590
course it will evolve and the idea that

1055
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,350
we will add versioning on the scheme we

1056
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,140
use for our identifiers so for now how

1057
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,790
one is doing well there are no level

1058
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,650
well-known sha-1 collision in the wild

1059
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,120
but they will arrive at some point and

1060
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,950
the idea that we will have new releases

1061
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,869
of our

1062
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,930
and afire skin and you know switch to a

1063
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,150
bigger hash function or better rush

1064
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,099
function so for the fun technological

1065
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:49,779
fact the only reason we don't have shot

1066
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:51,819
free yet is that when we started there

1067
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:54,160
wasn't yet a pretty decent shot or

1068
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,450
implementation in the Python standard

1069
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,970
library but in the version you know our

1070
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,890
stable releases we are using but we're

1071
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,319
ready to actually add that into the mix

1072
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,970
as well and maybe just you know adopt

1073
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,619
that as main identifier for the time

1074
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:08,140
being we are waiting for the truth shy

1075
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,869
one collision two to publish a paper as

1076
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,130
soon as possible

1077
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,359
in a security conference we found it I

1078
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,180
have took two questions first one is and

1079
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,619
if I am a user of this archive how do I

1080
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,289
find a better source code and there will

1081
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,720
there be some ranking system or some

1082
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,740
some distinction that I can take that I

1083
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,089
can take as take a sign to find a better

1084
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:38,559
source code which I'm actually

1085
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,230
interested in and the second question is

1086
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,130
how do you do do you make money would

1087
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,809
would you make money to support the all

1088
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,970
these since infrastructure and your work

1089
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,400
it will be donations like we keep

1090
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Wikipedia or some something else thank

1091
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,130
you okay very interesting two questions

1092
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,450
so the first one is how the first

1093
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,400
question is a potential very interesting

1094
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,559
use case now that you had this fantastic

1095
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,180
place where all the source code is

1096
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,730
available in a uniform way let me stress

1097
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,710
it a game and the value added here is

1098
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,839
that you had a uniform view of the

1099
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,309
source code no matter where it has been

1100
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:16,720
developed later now that you have this

1101
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,720
how can I ask a snap question like for

1102
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,259
example I am writing HTTP 7 under 32

1103
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:24,789
Baron because I prefer to write another

1104
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,859
one where could I find a piece of code

1105
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:28,359
which is irrelevant to what I am doing

1106
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,759
that's a potential application that can

1107
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:32,739
be built on top of the archive it is not

1108
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:35,140
our mission to do this application but

1109
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,059
it is our mission to make sure you have

1110
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:39,460
everything necessary to build it okay

1111
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,380
and there are people doing work in this

1112
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,640
if I mean if you are interested in this

1113
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,200
I can give you a pointer to researcher

1114
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,789
work in that particular direction there

1115
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:48,069
the challenge here is to scale I mean

1116
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:49,690
the scale is much bigger than what you

1117
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,309
see in this kind of thing I pass up a

1118
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:53,109
final question

1119
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:58,089
very cleaner here well I have one

1120
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,249
question answer them this the last

1121
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:02,649
question okay the second part very

1122
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:04,839
quickly so how we find the money you are

1123
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:06,339
right we need to eat at the end of the

1124
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:08,199
month of everybody but you see our

1125
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,449
strategies replication if you remember

1126
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:12,880
so we are building something which I I

1127
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,579
believe is valuable to many many many

1128
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,739
maybe seven parties so the idea is to

1129
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,539
have a common infrastructure where many

1130
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:22,929
different stakeholders put energy to

1131
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:25,539
make it stay it is not just for indicee

1132
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:26,979
not just for science not just for

1133
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:28,659
education and just for culture for

1134
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,609
everything so we are trying to talk to

1135
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:32,640
everybody and that should make it

1136
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,739
sufficient to make it for so things that

1137
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:38,109
we understand or do you want okay last

1138
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,969
question go ahead yeah my last question

1139
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:44,979
would be you make own own comments where

1140
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:47,679
you find it where where you when you

1141
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,779
find that this archive you pull do you

1142
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:55,179
give other options for historical

1143
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,819
reasons something some comments ability

1144
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:01,380
maybe in future so for historical

1145
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,929
listing because you what you do is so is

1146
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,959
a historical view on on source code so

1147
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,999
it would be maybe it would be an idea to

1148
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:13,029
also give an additional historical

1149
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:14,979
comment of some sort

1150
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:20,319
yeah plans I think we want to see omits

1151
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,839
it in this semantic wickety just after

1152
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,789
the the statement of mention the point

1153
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,529
is to make sure we connect with other

1154
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:28,919
initiative like wicked eight wicked at

1155
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:30,849
wikimedia other people who are doing

1156

History Museum the internet work I do

1158
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,599
something this to make sure that you

1159
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,669
find extra information on the source

1160
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:42,279
code and you connect it to what we are

1161
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:45,069
doing but again our main goal is just

1162
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,079
focus on the first code and make sure we

1163
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,059
connect with the other initiative don't

1164
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:50,799
try to reinvent the wheel just connect

1165
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:53,270
with other people okay thank you

1166
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,510

1167
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,130
your attention

1168
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:04,309
[Applause]

1169
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:08,190
right Thank You Roberto and Stefano we

1170
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,240
have a little bit for us so thank you

1171
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,069
enjoy and thanks for your talk

1172
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,760
I love the question before the word

1173
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,120
right

1174
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,740
we are young we go we are it turns out

1175
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,320
of those Raymond yeah so we have

1176
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,150
actually one is our own which is like it

1177
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,880
won't talk by people without the process

1178
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,160
what about the times that lead which

1179
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:43,880
will find what matters so what is

1180
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,789
actually subject to the function right

1181
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,619
that's with a pretty car at batch that's

1182
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:51,559
that's awkward because ideally you would

1183
00:49:51,559 --> 00:50:01,960
like what is that he doesn't store
