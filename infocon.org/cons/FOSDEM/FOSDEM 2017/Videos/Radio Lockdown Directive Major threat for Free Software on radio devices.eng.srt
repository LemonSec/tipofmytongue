1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,690
so yeah

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,480
thanks for attendance for your interest

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,330
and joining me today my name is max Mia

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,570
and the Free Software Foundation Europe

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,330
Germany coordinator and today I will be

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,650
talking about the radio lockdown

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,410
directive and why this so what this is

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,750
and why this will be a major threat for

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,980
free software on our radio devices so I

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,320
will start my presentation today with

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,180
explaining what this radio lockdown is

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,570
what this directive is exactly why it is

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,340
dangerous for us for free software

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,519
people or for basically all people who

15
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:40,890
are using radio devices how we can fight

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,600
it in the future what we are already

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,960
doing but what we plan to do and in a

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,089
very few minutes or in the last minutes

19
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,829
I will try to discuss the whole topic

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,929
and also answer your questions if you

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,859
have any so what is Radio lockdown where

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,350
you lockdown we call this like the

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,640
official name is the radio equipment

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,839
directive with us very sexy name 2014 53

25
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:08,280
/ you and the radio lockdown itself was

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,860
just a small article so I don't want to

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,009
annoy you with legal too many small

28
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,590
biggest things but this article 3 3 I

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,240
and it's a directive from by the U

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,149
Parliament also passed the EU Parliament

31
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,420
already in the middle of 2014 but it

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,869
will come in effect in June 2017 so this

33
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,680
year so this article 3 3 I what's in

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,430
there in this directive there's this

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,560
article standing radio equipment shall

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,869
be so constructed that it complies with

37
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,880
the following essential requirements

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,310
then there's a list of some things that

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,350
make sense on some of that or not that

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,240
much important for us but the last point

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,469
is so these these equipments should

42
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:58,020
support certain features in order to

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,420
ensure that software can only be loaded

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,549
into the radio equipment where the

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,700
compliance of the combination of radio

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,920
equipment and the software has been

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,530
demonstrated so this sounds pretty

48
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,950
boring right why is it so important well

49
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,930
first of all what is this compliance

50
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,700
compliance means

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,970
that the equipment or the software on it

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,720
complies with a with the signal

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,290
frequencies the signal strength and that

54
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,379
contains some certain features that are

55
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,130
required by law like by the radio

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,810
regulating authorities and the member

57
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,860
states so how should this happen so your

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,810
student seems to be so convinced that

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,910
it's really bad but how should

60
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,160
how should manufacturers make sure that

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,230
software can only be loaded onto the

62
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,260
devices that met these requirements well

63
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,549
in fact it's a signature based

64
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,030
verification and we already know this

65
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,280
and in other fields with trust chains

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,780
some manufacturers call it high

67
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,349
assurance food we know this from the

68
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,540
personal computer or the computer sector

69
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,610
with secure boot what we've seen with

70
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,220
Microsoft happening and in fact it's

71
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,930
just another digital restriction

72
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,220
management DRM so that we as users

73
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,470
cannot can no longer access the devices

74
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,620
or cannot not and longer do everything

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,079
with the devices that we could do but

76
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,239
that there's a software restriction on

77
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,720
it so the regulating authorities are the

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,900
ones that stand behind that call that

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,100
also cognitive radio and what is that

80
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,989
that's more less like a real-time

81
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,079
communication of each and every radio

82
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,630
device so each device can send or

83
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,600
receive radio communicating with

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,049
regulatory authorities so again this

85
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,180
could be a solution how this can be

86
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,970
realized it's not in fact already

87
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,040
installed but this could can be how it

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,799
can look like so that every device

89
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,989
already always knows where it is located

90
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,959
in which member state in which country

91
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,450
and that it can obtain a spectrum

92
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,210
license from this regulatory authority

93
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,060
so that the device always knows on a

94
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,599
software and it always knows how

95
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,449
and what frequencies can I send with

96
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,119
which signal strength so for example in

97
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:35,689
Germany

98
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,360
routers may only send with 100

99
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,369
milliwatts in the Wi-Fi frequency band

100
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,559
so that the device always knows where it

101
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:48,379
is and what is it is allowed to do so

102
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,679
one of the people who is working on that

103
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,589
topic - calls it the with a wet dream of

104
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:58,729
the regulators so yeah why is this

105
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,479
dangerous well first of all it affects

106
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,469
all radio capable devices so all devices

107
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:09,559
that can send or receive radio waves so

108
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,930
for example these are the routers that

109
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,330
we were talking about but this is also

110
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:30,080
smartphone or excuse me yeah it's just

111
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,209
repeating like father father's dream and

112
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,249
it's also not only sending devices but

113
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,979
also pure devising that resource devices

114
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,129
that only receive signals like 4 J for

115
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,899
example GPS receivers yes so this is

116
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:49,729
really crazy this is basically bad for

117
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,199
many things for example for free

118
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,289
software initiatives like open wrt or

119
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,839
the communities around the android

120
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,990
custom roms community Wi-Fi projects

121
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,749
like typhoon but also for the people who

122
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:04,819
are writing the drivers for Wi-Fi

123
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,639
devices or something like that so

124
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,829
basically all people that write a

125
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,689
software that can be loaded onto

126
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,349
hardware devices which are or which they

127
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,430
buy from from the shelf somewhere so

128
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,110
this is bad because we still don't know

129
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,329
or we have no idea and in this directive

130
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,519
it's not written how this compliance

131
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,899
assessment process should be running so

132
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,669
the manufacturers have to check or have

133
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,889
to to make sure that only software can

134
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,680
be loaded onto these those devices that

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,490
meet these requirements

136
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,560
but how does does this procedure look

137
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,789
like as far as we know if you write

138
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,499
firmware or software that should be

139
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:49,810
loaded onto a device you have to send

140
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,659
this software to the manufacturer and

141
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,240
then somehow magically he finds out

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,610
whether this is okay or this is not okay

143
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,919
but there's no definition on how long

144
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,259
this process should take place if they

145
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,770
only have four weeks or four years this

146
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,770
has to happen probably for every single

147
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,810
software that is written so for every

148
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,389
update as well so if you're on developer

149
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,050
of open wrt for every security update

150
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,789
you may have to send your software to

151
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,800
the manufacturer and he then has to

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,900
assess whether the software meets the

153
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,050
requirements so this is raising the

154
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,800
costs extremely the time-wise costs and

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,089
maybe also the hardware cost for

156
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,189
community Wi-Fi projects maybe they have

157
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,639
to choose other models other router

158
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,469
models for example that are more costly

159
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,509
because the manufacturers have a better

160
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,900
process of assessing the software and

161
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,490
yeah this is just crazy bureaucracy

162
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,800
right because for everything we have to

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,990
send the software somewhere and have to

164
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,300
check it somehow and we have this trust

165
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,449
chains and so on this is really bad for

166
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,490
free software businesses it's a

167
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,919
completely legit business model to buy

168
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,770
off-the-shelf hardware and build a

169
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,020
software or firmware around it and then

170
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,169
sell it to your customers and this

171
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,310
directive yeah installs a huge

172
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,439
competition issue because the

173
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,569
manufacturer of the original hardware

174
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,930
can just take or take himself a long

175
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,659
time to assess the software of the

176
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,399
software although the free software

177
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,179
business or whatever business so they

178
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,360
can influence how fast a software update

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,120
can be rolled out and features can be

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,179
rolled out this is really bad for the

181
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,120
white security because it disables us

182
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,399
the users and the people outside to

183
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,949
update their firmware or to to install a

184
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,460
new software you feel

185
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,930
we're on the devices that we own

186
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,130
actually many people want to install

187
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,530
more secure or more privacy friendly

188
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,630
software on their devices for example if

189
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,630
you buy a smartphone nowadays it's full

190
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,550
of proprietary software and maybe you

191
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,890
want to install them in custom ROM which

192
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,080
contains at least less proprietary

193
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,950
software or more free software on it so

194
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,350
these people will be hindered to to

195
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,650
secure themselves and then this whole

196
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,690
signature checking process involves that

197
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,240
on the devices there will most likely be

198
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,580
running a virtual machine so we have

199
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,060
another attack vector on our devices so

200
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,880
it's another small computer inside these

201
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,570
computers that can be attacked and most

202
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,970
lost so probably this will be a black

203
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,670
box it's a proprietary software so we

204
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,080
lose again control over our devices so

205
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,370
this is really bad for sustainability

206
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,330
and the environment because for example

207
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,350
I take the the routers again routers

208
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,910
after two or three years they don't get

209
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,610
any updates anymore and people are used

210
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:04,880
to

211
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,550
then maybe installing other firmware on

212
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,250
it like the dimensions lead or open wrt

213
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,300
to in length the life cycle of their

214
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,770
hardware if the manufacturer then

215
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,360
doesn't assess the software anymore for

216
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,590
all the devices and doesn't allow the

217
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,860
software to be loaded yeah the devices

218
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,290
that we bought are in a few years very

219
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,910
insecure and we have to throw them away

220
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,440
because we cannot use them anymore

221
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,250
productively and in fact it's rather

222
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,010
senseless all the stuff as was mentioned

223
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,030
here in the in the audience it's also

224
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,030
affecting receiving devices that do not

225
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,710
send anything and that do not interfere

226
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,080
with other software with other hardware

227
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,630
sorry and evil people who want to do

228
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,150
evil stuff and human their devices to

229
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,570
send on other frequencies or with bigger

230
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,750
signal strength will find ways how to

231
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,450
circumvent that so this is targeting

232
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,200
normal user

233
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,750
people who don't want to do something in

234
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,540
each it was it and in the past we've

235
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,260
seen only very few incidents where

236
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,260
hardware has been sending on frequencies

237
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,360
or with signal strength that are not

238
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,460
allowed so and these incidents were not

239
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,090
free software from various or devices

240
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,770
that have been loaded with free software

241
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,230
or other alternative terminals but these

242
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,300
have in most cases been cheap China

243
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,520
devices or something like that so many

244
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,770
people ask where does the senseless

245
00:11:42,770 --> 00:12:00,050
directed yes maybe good thank you for

246
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,570
the edition yes I repeat that he

247
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,400
mentioned that it also raises the cost

248
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,620
for a researching project for university

249
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,990
because they now have to buy other

250
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,730
devices that maybe have disabled these

251
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,740
signature-based features so yeah

252
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,390
this is another problem and there are

253
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,820
many more so this list is not finished

254
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,060
yet so you will find many many sectors

255
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,360
where people are harmed but again I'm

256
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,310
coming to this point where does this

257
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,280
directive actually come from as far as

258
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,080
we know we still don't have all the

259
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,480
information it's coming from the Etsy

260
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,890
which is the European telecommunications

261
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,830
standards Institute and as far as we

262
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,270
know they are concerned about

263
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,250
software-defined radio SDR so STRs I'm

264
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,290
not technician so sorry if I talk a

265
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,690
little bit crap but in fact these are

266
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,620
cheap chips or cheaper chips and they

267
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,360
are not limited to certain frequencies

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,180
or certain signal strengths anymore

269
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,090
because the older chip design was that

270
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,320
it had a fixed soldered frequency and

271
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
maybe also a limitation on strength and

272
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,660
now with these STRs for example they

273
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,480
could be able to send Wi-Fi signals and

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,060
sorry Wi-Fi signals

275
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,970
and Bluetooth signals at the same time

276
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,230
with the same chip

277
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,210
that decreases costs and yeah it's more

278
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,670
or less the future but yeah of course

279
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,640
you will also be able to do a lot of so

280
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,770
too with the software when I can control

281
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,330
the software that you can also send on

282
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,280
frequencies that are maybe not allowed

283
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,800
to send one so this is the downside of

284
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,500
course so the Etsy or the people who

285
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,630
stand behind this directive may also

286
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,090
have been targeting the 5g mobile

287
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,880
networks or the this technology that may

288
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,090
come up in the future

289
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,370
still again I'm no technician but I

290
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,020
think it's because of their also

291
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,900
introduced communications and so they

292
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,750
want to regulate that a little bit and

293
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,980
some people said that it's because of

294
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,110
the weather Raiders because in the five

295
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,870
gigahertz Wi-Fi band there were

296
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,510
interferences with weather Raiders so

297
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,810
these routers have to have inbuilt um a

298
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,030
special mechanism that is communicating

299
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,580
with these weather radar stations so

300
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,290
that they are not interfering with each

301
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,140
other on certain frequencies and some of

302
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,100
these devices which are not compliant

303
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,620
yeah don't support this certain feature

304
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,050
of this intercommunication feature and

305
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,150
therefore interview with weather radios

306
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,780
but again the number of cases where this

307
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,880
has taken place there's very little and

308
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,420
people also ask is this somehow combined

309
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,340
with the business FCC which are locked

310
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,010
down in the u.s. yes it is as far as we

311
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,400
know this FCC which are locked down is a

312
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,330
reaction on what Etsy or the European

313
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,920
institution planned for the European

314
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,100
market so they said hey guys in the u.s.

315
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,770
we want you to regulate this sector you

316
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,380
also have to do something similar in the

317
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,180
US so we can cover the two large markets

318
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,830
but in fact what we have in Europe is

319
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,230
much worse than what we have in the US

320
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,830
because in US it's only limited to Wi-Fi

321
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,130
frequencies and in Europe it's really as

322
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,010
I said all devices

323
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,550
all frequencies sending and receiving

324
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,140
devices so what can we do to get rid of

325
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,570
this radio lockdown legally we cannot do

326
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,340
much anymore because this directive has

327
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,580
been has passed the European Parliament

328
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,190
there is little chance that we can that

329
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,740
we can attack it in front of the courts

330
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,580
so we have to somehow find other ways

331
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,860
one problem we still have is that we

332
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,030
have still have too little background

333
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,950
information so we still don't really

334
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,310
know what is the position of certain

335
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,110
industries or do they already know about

336
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,440
this radio lockdown what do the European

337
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,270
institutions or the Member States

338
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,280
Institute institutions think about that

339
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,010
for example we have in all those member

340
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,840
states we have network agencies or

341
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,000
something in similar what do they what

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,870
do they think about that and what are

343
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,970
politicians think about that what is

344
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,370
their position or do they already know

345
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,560
what will come up in the future I really

346
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,250
doubt it

347
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,920
so yeah but initial ad so one about one

348
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,200
year ago we started the FC started

349
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,270
setting up a joint statement against

350
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,750
radio lockdown and up to this day there

351
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,900
were 46 organizations and companies

352
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,640
signing this joint statement where we

353
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,160
summarized what radio lockdown is why

354
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,250
this bed and stating some demands to the

355
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,240
EU institutions and yes we are still

356
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,430
trying to increase this list and this is

357
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,220
only a small selections of the

358
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,630
organizations and companies that are

359
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,420
supporting us but now coming to them how

360
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,829
we can really fight it in the future

361
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,740
this was only raising Iran awareness in

362
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,480
the directive there's a passage that the

363
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,600
European Commission is allowed to make

364
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,470
delegated acts and delegated acts are a

365
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,790
possibility to in this case to define

366
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,130
the classes of devices which are

367
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,340
affected by radio dr. this sounds a

368
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,800
little bit complicated but the European

369
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,049
Commission can do

370
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,110
for example we bet all devices that

371
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,470
Senator send Wi-Fi signals are excluded

372
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,289
from the radio lockdown in order to

373
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,160
influence this we applied for an expert

374
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,270
group of the EU Commission just mid of

375
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,410
January and we hope to get into there to

376
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,830
influence this definition of classes but

377
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,809
we still don't know what as I said we

378
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:17,799
still don't know what the you

379
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,980
institutions and the policy makers are

380
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,000
targeting yet if they want to make

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,450
groped exceptions for device classes or

382
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,330
if they want just yeah wanted to stay

383
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,730
the same and we also want to get in

384
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,820
there to gather some information so as

385
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,820
far as I know the Free Software

386
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,650
Foundation Europe applied to that and

387
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,960
also to other organizations that we know

388
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,240
that share parts are large parts of our

389
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,380
of our opinion on that

390
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,600
so yeah let's hope that we can get into

391
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,780
this body and in fact we are still on

392
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,190
from the first day on we are trying to

393
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,679
build alliances with other sectors so

394
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,770
for example with the science sector we

395
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,500
started to to write and communicate what

396
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,120
they are thinking about that and what

397
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
their position is and yes the position

398
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,470
of them is really an opposing radio

399
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,990
lockdown we are trying to raise

400
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,549
awareness in other industries

401
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,809
so we have little information how it is

402
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,140
in the router segment but we still don't

403
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,020
know what for example with the GPS

404
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,220
industry what's happening there

405
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,220
we're trying to find the lines or allies

406
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,330
in the civil society with amateur radio

407
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,010
operators or with community Wi-Fi

408
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,320
projects like fire phone or any nukes in

409
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,840
Italy and so on yes that's something

410
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,789
that we still do and that's something

411
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,260
that I have been doing today

412
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,090
raising awareness in front of you

413
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,429
telling you that this is a really major

414
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,909
threat for free software and for our

415
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:56,830
freedom of yeah access and if you're if

416
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,570
you're an organization or company please

417
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,380
sign

418
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,630
joint statement it's linked down here

419
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,000
from this page join our mailing list we

420
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,210
have a moderated manliness or yeah you

421
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,299
can you can join this and to discuss the

422
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,710
issues and help us finding answers for

423
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,750
the questions we have and yes please

424
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,970
discuss about that talk with that about

425
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,280
about that with your colleagues and so

426
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,730
on and yes please find me if you have

427
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,440
any questions and we cannot answer all

428
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,270
questions find me at the efforts of a

429
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,190
booth in building K and the crown floor

430
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:41,530
thanks for attention next question we

431
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,409
have skin in this game little IOT

432
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,450
devices too small to run digital

433
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,360
signatures for example so have you

434
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,100
spoken to any people who consider

435
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,020
themselves into the IOT game and ask

436
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,970
them if they happy to quadruple approach

437
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,039
their product to put a smarter chip in

438
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,850
to even be able to do any of that stuff

439
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,530
no we have not directly spoken to anyone

440
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,559
and their sector about because it sounds

441
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,299
like it kills the whole lot stone-dead

442
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,880
yeah but i think there will be obliged

443
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,100
to comply with this directive so they

444
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,840
have to somehow implement a virtual

445
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,299
machine or a chip that is checking these

446
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:17,799
signatures let me tell you it's not

447
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,940
happening with the sort of stuff we're

448
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,350
doing so it would eliminate our product

449
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,669
category essentially sure it would be

450
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,280
10x even maybe more high very

451
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,640
interesting talk it wasn't clear from

452
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,530
the text of the directive our existing

453
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,240
hardware devices affected as well or

454
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
just new devices that they're coming on

455
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
the market just new devices starting

456
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,280
with those who come into the market from

457
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,039
June 2017 so existing ones are excluded

458
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,320
as well as and that maybe I can mention

459
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,220
that as well as a mature part rails like

460
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,260
hardware that is only available for

461
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,250
amateur radio operators but most amateur

462
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,809
radio operators use off-the-shelf

463
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,150
hardware that can they can buy in this

464
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,659
in this

465
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:15,009
so it's rather senseless hi thanks for

466
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,659
your talk max my name is Sebastian I

467
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:19,509
work for you Veda who is the standing

468
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,700
reporter in the European Parliament on

469
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,269
the directive and thank you for you up

470
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,009
there who raised the question regarding

471
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:29,349
the the implement the embedded devices

472
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,940
that won't be able to check these

473
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,570
signatures so if I may would like to

474
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,059
clarify that the signature checks are

475
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,519
only a theoretical idea so for now we

476
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,369
don't know how manufactures will try to

477
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,179
implement the whole measure at all and I

478
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,879
think so what is what is happening right

479
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,849
now is that an expert group firstly

480
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:54,070
needs to define the classes of devices

481
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,599
that are at all affected by the

482
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,179
directive for now there is no class

483
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,759
definition ready yet and as far as I

484
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,599
know if it's not ready by June 2017 then

485
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,690
I don't know what what happens with with

486
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,739
with the deadline regarding the

487
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,570
manufacturers because they are told that

488
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,820
they cannot any longer provide these

489
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,440
devices on the European market anymore

490
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,389
if the class definitions aren't done

491
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,109
until then so I would I would expect

492
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,710
that for these I will call them dumb

493
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,509
devices that won't be able to check

494
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,159
signatures that won't be able to receive

495
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,590
updates because once in a while

496
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,619
something will be will be broken and

497
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,509
then certain devices will need to be I

498
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:37,119
know you know all that from from blu-ray

499
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,830
so I won't go into it so I would expect

500
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,139
that these devices would be taken out of

501
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:48,519
the definition now my question I do have

502
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,940
a question but it may not be to you but

503
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,729
rather to the audience is so we have a

504
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,919
couple of people who we know who have

505
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,940
applied for this expert group and my

506
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,919
question to the audience is do you know

507
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,679
how we can define a number of devices

508
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,629
that should be excluded from the

509
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:09,190
directive without telling the Commission

510
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,470
we're basically exclude all SDR devices

511
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,340
because that won't happen

512
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:25,490
we're doing speaking with microphone you

513
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,470
could probably start with I mean this

514
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,050
okay I've only read the UK version of

515
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,850
the thing which defines all the EU bans

516
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,500
and how you're allowed to use them and

517
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,810
the duty cycles and so on but you could

518
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,760
probably sensibly say that anything

519
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,740
which is allowed to use a shared channel

520
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,230
and that has limits on its duty cycle

521
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,390
and its power providing it is compliant

522
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,800
with those should be excluded that would

523
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,530
probably exclude 90% of the

524
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,970
non-threatening things straight away

525
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,830
because you've already got wording which

526
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,450
you could probably latch on to to make

527
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,640
that happen with a stroke of a pen we

528
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,600
have one last question it seems to me

529
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,820
that the big problems are with battens

530
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,580
and radiated power and what we want to

531
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,020
be able to do is just put our software

532
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,280
on the device so if if the class

533
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,980
definition excluded devices where the

534
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,110
bands and regulated radiated power were

535
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,080
regulated and hardware manufacturers

536
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,580
could then put a little circuit on the

537
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,110
device that prevented it going outside

538
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,630
those bands and radiated power but then

539
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,070
the entire software at the device could

540
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,960
still be open because the software

541
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,460
wouldn't be able to break the limits

542
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,560
imposed by the hardware that might be a

543
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,850
way of getting completely free software

544
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,470
on the devices while still making sure

545
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,210
that they couldn't go outside their

546
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,790
limits and the direct and the definition

547
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,530
could say if the limits are in Hardware

548
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,980
none of this pies I'm sorry we only have

549
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,630
time for one last question you had your

550
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,400
hand up earlier maybe one comments to

551
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,250
that one problem we have with with the

552
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,250
member states we have one problem with

553
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,310
the member states that in the 28 member

554
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,260
states there are different limitations

555
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,480
on frequencies and the signal Springs as

556
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,790
far as I know so manufacturers would

557
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,150
have to set the limits for each and

558
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,260
every country individually

559
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,540
but we can we can discuss later with

560
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,210
maybe a very fun reading literally

561
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,030
interactive all the devices having

562
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,630
faster converters analog-to-digital

563
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,800
would be banned you can have a radio

564
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,030
transmitter using Raspberry Pi with PWM

565
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,850
so you should burn everything okay

566
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,470
right taya is the border which is a

567
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,200
Scylla scope but you can use the FPGA to

568
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,520
create a radio transmitter so I can you

569
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,530
check all this kind of devices

570
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,390
thank you very much max unfortunately we

571
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,730
have to clear out of the Deborah now sex

572
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,970
again

573
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,090
you
