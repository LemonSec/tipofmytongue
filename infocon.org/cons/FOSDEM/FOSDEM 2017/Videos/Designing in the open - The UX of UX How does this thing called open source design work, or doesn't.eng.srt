1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,719
so we

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,310
so yes this is the UX of UX it's pretty

3
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,850
meta topic but and also is actually the

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,440
stock it's very important to me because

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,890
a couple of months back I realized that

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,300
I actually completed five years with

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,460
open source primarily with design this

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,499
tag is mostly about how what was my

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,089
experience as a person who didn't know

10
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,980
how to write code as a person who didn't

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,920
know how to just know how to design a

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,929
couple of few things I don't know and I

13
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,089
said I don't know write code I say I

14
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,739
didn't even know how to write proper

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,350
semantic HTML so I started from there

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,719
and it's been five years and this talk

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,100
is about the behind the scenes of how I

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,199
picked up Who am I

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm ragu layer I am currently a master

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,100
student interaction design I am a huge

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,530
open source fan that I was working on

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,450
open source software before get up

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,649
happened there are things which are

24
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,630
notorious so I've seen the transition

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,430
happened from Vittorio's to github

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,369
titurius to get up get up to the lab all

27
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,189
all sort of things yes stare time five

28
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,320
years back when I was starting out in a

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,549
design there was a couple of things

30
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,100
which happened to me which were so

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,840
awesome which I if I think we look back

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,359
and I think about it I went first

33
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,649
started with open so design if they

34
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,659
didn't happen with me so this talk is

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,000
mostly about that part and my learnings

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
from those things and what to avoid and

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,979
what not so work first thing yes if

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,630
you're working on open source divinity

39
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,329
be welcoming now by being welcoming I

40
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,969
don't say say hi reply back to emails

41
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,000
you know small small talk chitchat no

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,409
being welcoming I mean do contributors

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,999
maintain the spirit of the project it's

44
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,770
important I mean you gotta you gotta be

45
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,090
welcoming for them you've got a

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,640
documents you can be the documents your

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
contribution guidelines contribution

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
guidelines

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,330
should actually include getting started

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,050
should actually into the core of conduct

51
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,090
start out maybe but you know even if

52
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,310
your project is small having these small

53
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,770
small small things either one of them or

54
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,350
all of them makes the project extremely

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,000
welcoming for a person who's kind of shy

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,350
doesn't like to write meals to people

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,640
and is just looking out for the right

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,710
thing it went bad for me because this is

59
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,900
something which happened using Vicki

60
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,930
effectively Vicki gives an awesome

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,060
option of how to adding the wiki pages

62
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,490
wiki pages which is kind of under used

63
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,740
for and manuf or open source projects

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,380
kind of a lot of good open source

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,390
products and I kind of left that so

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,570
giving Vicki effectively made a lid it

67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,460
made it super simple for new people

68
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,010
coming in using tags no tags

69
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,110
issue tracker has a feature called

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,900
tagging yes everyone everyone probably

71
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,250
here knows that no my tags I see a lot

72
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,709
of a lot of use tags like UX design

73
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,470
starter jobs for me my personal favorite

74
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,550
was back in the day when I came across

75
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,850
this this this primarily changed my

76
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,440
outlook towards open source design and

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,570
was the biggest factor how I got hooked

78
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,680
into open source design

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,590
juniel apps plus design junior jobs can

80
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,810
be a developer studio jobs can be for

81
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,880
designer studio jobs can be for content

82
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,290
people judah's apps can be for everyone

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,420
so you got subcategorize the junior jobs

84
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,920
not just use junior jobs

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,390
subcategorized into' small or smaller

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,489
even smaller categories so that the

87
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,110
right person reaches the right place

88
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,420
this is the easiest way to get people on

89
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,770
board when you're doing open source

90
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,950
design onboarding onboarding is

91
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,800
important now by onboarding I mean

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,430
software morning so five years back or

93
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,050
like maybe two years back or maybe even

94
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,760
yesterday when I'm looking at a new open

95
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,220
source cool open source project and I

96
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,250
really really want to feel like and I

97
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,019
want to contribute to us I mean this is

98
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,579
this is awesome land I would like to

99
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,140
kind of it to it something like this

100
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,540
happens with me I gotta run some

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,180
comments I'm not about as programmer so

102
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm just talking like a designer right

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,100
now

104
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,200
you got it saw the note shows yeah you

105
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,740
got a

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,860
compiled your CSS JavaScript and yeah by

107
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,630
the time it happens I'm like oh no man

108
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,069
this isn't some error comes up and I

109
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,430
just give up on it this is the easiest

110
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,199
way to get a person who's not a

111
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,509
developer off board from your project

112
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,490
even before he has started this happened

113
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,919
with me with a lot of projects this how

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,970
it didn't happen with me a lot of

115
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,229
credits as well so which is a big

116
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,650
thumbs-up so reducing installation steps

117
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,630
the biggest example the first thing

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,800
which came to my mind when I started

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,780
that reduction in installation steps and

120
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,759
which everyone should need someone from

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,470
is actually the work best part in

122
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,690
uninstall I don't need to touch the code

123
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,729
base I mean it's simple even the

124
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,530
language the content everything is

125
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,750
simple it's translated it's like you can

126
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,370
do this in any language I mean you can

127
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,870
think of it I know it's a big community

128
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,690
but it's a simple install it's like it's

129
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,310
worth the effort I think this is

130
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,930
something it has not changed in repair

131
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:30,930
since like something which happened to

132
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,330
me and I came across this term called

133
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,740
design objectivity this is something

134
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,490
which I use almost on a daily basis like

135
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,500
a kind of a debated topic design

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,750
objectivity in other terms is also

137
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,759
called as pixel you know good

138
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,380
definitions and epics of memes

139
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,870
kind of found this which was always

140
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,909
there this is like some other pixel Fox

141
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,259
pays more attention to things like green

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,810
then the world effectiveness was shot it

143
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,500
was not quoted by but I saw it is from

144
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,830
the urban dictionary yes basically that

145
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,599
happens in open source community and

146
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,759
design being subjective everyone wants

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,889
to be the designer there are discussions

148
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,690
there are discussions which are very

149
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,699
long and that happens in in these

150
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,830
discussions the best design solutions

151
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,180
are kind of lost in the middle because

152
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,770
everyone wants to put on their thoughts

153
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,509
and every call is kind of different from

154
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,009
the other good or bad it's probably good

155
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,259
it can be bad but it that's different so

156
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,030
dealing with design objectivity is

157
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,300
actually a very important very very

158
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,689
important issue at now

159
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,369
discussion with a colleague of mine as

160
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,559
well a couple of days back we have

161
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,929
discussed like that that we did it

162
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,269
I mean the way the community I currently

163
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,699
contributing next lab is it is pretty

164
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,419
awesome

165
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,879
so in case I'm absent and to people who

166
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,009
have been contributing around say yes

167
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,949
this works we lock it down we do not

168
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,929
take for the ideas we take ideas between

169
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,029
take ideas for v1 we take ideas for v2

170
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,909
so that's the easiest way to get of even

171
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,699
out and that's the point I mean getting

172
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,289
a result is more important having a

173
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,269
discussion or having a super super long

174
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:17,139
discussion able to fix it is defining a

175
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,179
design language now design language can

176
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,939
be a visual style that lettuce on there

177
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,209
that CSS here because CSS guidelines are

178
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,800
like classes and all no I'm talking

179
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,969
about design here it doesn't have to be

180
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:32,709
no your buttons should have this much

181
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,809
border-radius know if I have a certain

182
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,729
sense of UX and what I'm looking at for

183
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,279
what my language senses in the project

184
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,439
if you're enough to say that it's it's

185
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,239
kind of you're always there you get you

186
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,979
didn't go to define your design language

187
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,769
it's okay it's fine this is something

188
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,469
which can also help out in reducing

189
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,709
pixel less or design objectivity

190
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,999
in your projects which comes to me is

191
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,979
like feature requests so I mean to

192
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,349
maintain a cool maintain a repository

193
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,929
which is a calendar application on top

194
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:09,369
of on top of next lab and we get a we

195
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:10,839
got a fuckload of feature requests like

196
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,059
every day like probably five or

197
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,889
something you know but there's a time

198
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:17,379
and I'm busy I'm like a student like my

199
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,449
other cool enjoy is also student so how

200
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,879
do we deal with so many of them it's a

201
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,129
simple it's a simple logic we implement

202
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,779
relevant requests and adequate not all

203
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:33,269
of them unless all of them irrelevant so

204
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,068
that's our pole building is not

205
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,558
appealing it's not a difficult thing to

206
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,929
do I mean you didn't need a forum for it

207
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,639
now get up allows you to put a thumbs up

208
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,559
or thumbs down in the feature itself in

209
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,629
the issue itself so if you have like

210
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,009
people who actually request a feature

211
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,589
you can and it's like a you really

212
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,240
talked about it actually becomes your v1

213
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
it's not my personality

214
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,380
first driving my design or my personal

215
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,540
test driving my features it's the

216
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,829
community which is driving my features

217
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,630
it's like if if the committee really

218
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,250
wants there'll be a lot of people

219
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,019
actually growing up green for dinner if

220
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,700
there's a bug which is like annoying a

221
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,800
lot of users and abusers may be enough

222
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
putting their thumbs up on it so this is

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,149
like a great great a great way to figure

224
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,399
out how which features and which bug

225
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,930
fixes to fix to fix design thinking

226
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,790
design thinking is actually one of the

227
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,370
most neglected topics I'm sorry but

228
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,010
that's how it is it's like they're

229
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,990
engineers and it's very very engineering

230
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,579
German now even I'm turning out to be

231
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,138
more of an engineer it was a Saturday

232
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,680
it's still still lacks him here already

233
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,630
we were here earlier but we gotta reach

234
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,639
here that's that's that's the difference

235
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,990
we gotta make and today that we designed

236
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,139
since the start now involving design

237
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,510
since a start can be done in a couple of

238
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,420
ways I know a lot of people actually go

239
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,000
write articles or I mean not like

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,760
articles like essays on you know I said

241
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,010
I need a feature that's like I mean I

242
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,910
need just feature I need this

243
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,500
enhancement it can be done in this way I

244
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,089
see a lot of people very paragraphs

245
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,329
about it no just draw a simple volume

246
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,560
and put it out there it's easily

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,370
debatable

248
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,890
a lot of our films and it's

249
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,360
scientifically proven that images are

250
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,459
registered to have had more than text us

251
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,160
so that's another way of looking at it

252
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,790
so that's that's pretty much how we do

253
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,760
it we put out by flips it straight or

254
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,410
avoid films and we get the solution out

255
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,269
so involving design since they start

256
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,260
they have the perfect solution or

257
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,630
perfectly even at least all the time so

258
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,640
that's how it should be if you are

259
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,160
engineer it it's the easiest way to best

260
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,769
abuse ability and which we see in a lot

261
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,380
of software's not even just not even

262
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,089
just an open source even a lot of

263
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,459
proprietary software we see all

264
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,380
engineering when engineering is driving

265
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,449
design not the other way around

266
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,220
this is a lot of our engineer planet we

267
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,370
if you see a lot of this is a lot of

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,010
we see a lot of features been

269
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,690
implemented at the wrong place at the

270
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,300
right and at the wrong time which could

271
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,040
have halted and more important feature

272
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,900
should have brought in or desired design

273
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,460
which could have been better which could

274
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,020
have been no use about if design was

275
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,000
there since the start if the design had

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,260
not come in then

277
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,510
it was a visual stage or like halfway

278
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,820
through the process no design has to be

279
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,790
in the start and I can like cry about it

280
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,830
all the time get the design in since the

281
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,530
start so this is basically what I

282
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,290
realized so as a small recap of what we

283
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,810
talked about yes being welcoming being

284
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,940
welcoming doesn't mean writing emails

285
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,710
being welcoming means contributor

286
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,840
guidelines standards keep everything

287
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,360
there there's a need of a lot of focus

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,860
on all morning because a lot of people

289
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,270
leave because they could not get the

290
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,550
software installed yeah don't the

291
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,680
pixels too much man it's it's allowing

292
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,460
to reduce so many futures then requests

293
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,890
then I mean then you realize what's

294
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,750
important that's not important and that

295
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,150
can be that can be done first what can

296
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,720
be done later on it's not a priority and

297
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,710
involving design since the start which

298
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,960
is probably the most important thing and

299
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,910
I think this is one of the majority of

300
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,680
the things we'd like to focus on open

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
source design as well because we are a

302
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,750
bunch of cool designers so let's I am

303
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,080
broken and I have time for Q and a

304
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:34,180
[Applause]

305
00:12:34,180 --> 00:13:09,230
any questions I mean see for me even

306
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,750
having a panel is not like a priority I

307
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,200
have a eye and luckily in all the

308
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,730
committee's I've been to it has a very

309
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,000
flexible panel like say for the month of

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
October I have three people who are like

311
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,780
contributing a lot to the project they

312
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,430
automatically a part of my panel so in

313
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:38,109
case I'm okay sure super flexible

314
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,470
when can you can you repeat the question

315
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:22,010
started at this moment I I'm in film a

316
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,579
smaller part of next cloud repositories

317
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,930
we follow the next lab guidelines and we

318
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,800
do have a solid area next talk about it

319
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,510
and yeah I mean it's not it's not having

320
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,250
like a visual style guide I mean even if

321
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,279
you I mean even if you know that the

322
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,899
kind of content you would like to write

323
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:47,079
on even that's that's enough I mean like

324
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,269
sign-in versus log in you know I don't

325
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:51,800
want sign-in to be everywhere I would

326
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,050
like login to be everywhere I mean that

327
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,370
kind of thing if you know your design

328
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,100
language that's I mean that's important

329
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,600
consistency is important

330
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,339
I mean content is also something you

331
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,199
just kind of all look because this looks

332
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,820
look this looks fine on this panel so

333
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,529
let's put this on it might just go

334
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,570
inconsistent somewhere else so those

335
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,010
things are smaller smaller things which

336
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,079
can be taken I mean which time taking

337
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,260
taken care of and yeah that's

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,640
I mean sometimes it's important to you

339
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,160
know to step back and say dude I'm doing

340
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,340
this and it's going out for v1 whatever

341
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,810
discussions happen now on it we'll go

342
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,120
out for v2 I mean otherwise designed

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,890
this will move ahead sometimes it's very

344
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,950
important to rule the v1 out then to

345
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,380
discuss way too much about v1 and the

346
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,540
easiest way to do that is you know

347
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,870
getting people to agree on one and then

348
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,490
really all from that rather than or

349
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,370
discussing it I mean moving all is like

350
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,040
the most difficult part about design

351
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,100
process you know you know if you know v1

352
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,410
won't be like the most pixel perfect one

353
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,030
but at least there's some some

354
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,070
improvement than what was at v-0 and

355
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,570
that's more important

356
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,529
[Music]

357
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,790
the way I see it is every enhancement

358
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,109
any enhancement which changes the

359
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,079
experience in an ideal case scenario

360
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,150
should come in at least a pen one valium

361
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,970
I mean I mean you don't need to be an

362
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,929
artist to draw boxes and that's pretty

363
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,350
much it

364
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,390
that's pretty much when what you need

365
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,299
for v1 I mean it's more easier to pen

366
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,890
down your thoughts you just just joy I

367
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,910
mean you don't have to be an artist for

368
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,429
it at whatever cheating experience think

369
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:47,870
above the library's think about the user

370
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,730
experience here you think that okay this

371
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,890
buttons gotta go this side it'll be a

372
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,929
better experience than to go on the

373
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,610
other side you know you got a document

374
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,080
that that part that's what I actually

375
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,860
try to say her drawing is important you

376
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,059
have to do balsamic

377
00:18:17,789 --> 00:19:30,299
I mean extremely I mean I mean that's

378
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:37,320
true I mean that's true with us produced

379
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,950
especially goes actually which is a

380
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,999
blogging platform and it's design

381
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:47,190
thinking things in the story because a

382
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,229
couple of people who form the project or

383
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,749
actually designers that's me I mean

384
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,580
that's one really good example if you

385
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,470
are looking for Design Thinking since a

386
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,440
very very start I mean having wonders I

387
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,570
mean it's like a very commercial

388
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,009
statement to say but having one designer

389
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,200
on board in the very start is like the

390
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,669
way to be at least one

391
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:20,490
