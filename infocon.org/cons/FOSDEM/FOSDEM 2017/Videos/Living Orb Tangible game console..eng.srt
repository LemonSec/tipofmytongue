00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,809
I'm majority standard software engineer

3
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,180
and I'm here today to present you my

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,020
project

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,509
which in three what is a tangible game

6
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:28,279
console so you'll be able to play it

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:40,100
through the presentation this is amazing

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,960
so you have to find your way through the

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,920
through the exit regions of the project

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,109
it's like I'm having to play footage

11
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:56,480
panels as I mean games in a broader

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,449
sense I'm working at Ubisoft country I

13
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,300
would like to try new things there is a

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,450
movement so I mean pretty recent for me

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,420
which is known as our challenges are two

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,119
alternative controller which basically

17
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,329
means going back to the tangible

18
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,140
interfaces so having custom-made

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,860
controllers to to control maybe a unique

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,990
game but I mean there is a lot of very

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,590
funny

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,080
controllers

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,770
so I wanted to to go to to towards this

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,370
direction because younger in the school

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,850
I met some electronics on Mecca and so

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,700
on and then I suddenly stopped so I

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,869
wanted to go back to - to doing stuff

28
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,800
with electronics and as well also

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,070
interested in - lights and cross because

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:07,110
I found that so very inspiring so your

31
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,500
character is that and it is supposed to

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,330
stay on - tablet it really were

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:25,770
calibrated but certainly I discovered

34
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,350
this game which by the way the

35
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,370
alternative contrasting which is langu

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,060
bye-bye Robin Baumgarten and this it's

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,640
basically one dimensional Apogee but you

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,380
only have like colors to symbolize

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,500
characters enemies obstacles and so on

40
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,850
so there is a vocabulary of course not

41
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,150
yeah I thought it's possible to make

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,320
games with simple stuff as a LED strip

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,720
under just cores but but I wanted it to

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,370
to be more more close to the people and

45
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,590
that I really like the fact that you

46
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,730
you're holding it in the hands and so I

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,019
had this idea and I made the first

48
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,010
prototype which which are happy and as

49
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,710
you see it's a little bit more rough

50
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,140
[Applause]

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,450
it's yeah it's not as beautiful as this

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,650
one but I tested the concept and I also

53
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,260
dig into the process of yeah electronic

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,810
and mechanics so so what I got I met

55
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,090
four opposites based on a pretty serious

56
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,830
fear that you can buy almost anywhere

57
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,060
into art supply stores on and so and

58
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,550
then okay I said okay

59
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,080
I was very amateurish I had a letter E

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,260
but dimension was not good so I cut that

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,680
strip and sold wires and I care the ball

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
on the outside to purge the let's rip

63
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,000
and so on ya know this one

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Electronics is inside so you don't have

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:39,990
any outside stuff and it's yeah you have

66
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,860
something like that on the inside

67
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,970
everything was a Jaffa taped yeah a

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,880
battery which is most of the right of

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,030
the device is a USB battery and it was

70
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,080
just sketched yeah with these types and

71
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,580
yet but I'm even not surprised of that

72
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,110
because as a cable there's record of the

73
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,090
battery you know so I was younger so I

74
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:33,870
had to put run runs and a friend so that

75
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,320
and it's only

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,200
 like something better

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,170
it went through processor and so is a

78
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,350
little bit more into the 3d printing so

79
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,470
is made 3d printed version of the app so

80
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,890
it's it's dangerous to print it all at

81
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,710
once so you better do some blocks and

82
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,330
then some of them so every triangle here

83
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,520
was printed separately and then as some

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,640
and so that means you have an inner

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,580
structure to support each different

86
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,960
block and this will this or this will be

87
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,140
the case for the auto electronics as

88
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,060
well as you can see I'm sorry I haven't

89
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,150
bought it because it's not finished yet

90
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,870
[Music]

91
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,780
so as you see and let's also diffusers

92
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,210
because this one doesn't have diffusers

93
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,510
and when you look in the LED so you look

94
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,669
at the LEDs it's very intense and may be

95
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,180
painful

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,540
so some diffusers that was a very good

97
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,320
idea to do semi g2 for this one so

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,700
diffusers infrastructure so the algebra

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,110
weblog whose you see that there is a

100
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,500
small edges small edges inside the walls

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,290
so this is done to just support the LEDs

102
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,690
yeah a little bit of use a little offset

103
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,270
through the diffusers

104
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,810
and then you he would screw them to the

105
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:40,650
inner structure so I went back to the to

106
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,380
the pretty psteerenberg but taking the

107
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,510
idea firm of the diffusers and also the

108
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,510
inner structure as we see it so so that

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,070
was a really long process as well

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,980
because you had to do in other words for

111
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,930
each hose as I was actually two volts or

112
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,960
so to DIF that front geometers so it's

113
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:13,680
yeah it was real own hours wasted not

114
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,630
wasted arms it looks like that so I

115
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,100
could open it button and it'll not yet

116
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,440
but yeah so you see the connections and

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,930
yeah it's far more better than this one

118
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:46,650
it's because this LED strip I didn't

119
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,320
know about yeah what kind of led it was

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,050
and then I discovered you can buy

121
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,320
actually the LEDs without pads after

122
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,850
that trip and it's far more efficient to

123
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,940
put them inside

124
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,250
yeah and the switch mentioned so there

125
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,260
is a Nina yeah

126
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,360
there is only these plates is wrong

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,390
plate to suppose the computer so sensors

128
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,840
and so on so that he doesn't move but

129
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,500
it's it's ammeter is exactly the you

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,110
know janitor of the board so it's really

131
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,490
stuck into the building doesn't move and

132
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:42,090
no mortgage which made this this sort

133
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:58,680
prototype as well to the community for

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,010
the residency for the first prototype

135
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,540
there is a raspberry if you want you to

136
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,120
make sure to Arduino so okay I don't

137
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,140
know well as I will explain there is a

138
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,230
with the hot spot inside so with Arduino

139
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,590
it's a little bit more difficult but why

140
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,990
not sensor so there is an accelerometer

141
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,010
to catch up the up axis then a digital

142
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,710
compass to have the nose axis and then

143
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,320
you do a cross product to have actually

144
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,670
you base and then to our matrix to pass

145
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,590
forms from the bore space to the board

146
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,510
space so it is how I use this one and

147
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,100
that's really that's pretty cool I love

148
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,770
this one because yeah then what directly

149
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,180
out of the box also even with soldering

150
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:11,610
yet none bergdahl so on so on

151
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:18,149
you send the data in CL so the 24 first

152
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,980
bites first bit

153
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,560
sorry such a sin it's consumed by the

154
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
first read and then it acts as a rudder

155
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,019
for the second leg so you can send your

156
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,149
data along the strip and as well battery

157
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,970
of course was always worried as well and

158
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,040
the poorest um so everything that you

159
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,279
used to construct the to device so the

160
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,070
segue from from our raspberry P version

161
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,529
so there is Linux with with a refill hot

162
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,279
spot I bought HP which has a with the

163
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,140
interface built in but I haven't tried

164
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,250
it yet which it should work there is a

165
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,600
program in cyberspace

166
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,510
then to take the inputs from the sensors

167
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,200
and to generate the data for for the LED

168
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,120
strips as well I used to make them for

169
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,050
running up the games more easily

170
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,690
available so the games are actually in

171
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,070
Lua as well so there is a web server to

172
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,940
control our job so I actually show you

173
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,290
right now

174
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,680
this is interface I am connected to the

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,709
Wi-Fi hotspot on the web and so I'm

176
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:40,199
sorry but I will enter it your just to

177
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:42,660
show you how to how it was made so there

178
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,410
is a update function that is called

179
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,160
every frame and so you could say okay I

180
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,709
put on one this is a test LED and the

181
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,890
color is let's say white so that's what

182
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,440
would be the thing and as you can see

183
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,160
it's a usually a LED with those white

184
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,320
and this is the index this is a LED

185
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,980
number one

186
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,959
coordinate system so I won't go into

187
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,819
detail to interviewer but it's a really

188
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:27,110
simple language and I really like that

189
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,259
but just yeah so I'm I'm trying to put

190
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,829
the LEDs for the Formica for visualizing

191
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,579
the base and like the transformation

192
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,540
matrix so you see here that there is

193
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,509
three colors and which should represent

194
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,920
the three axis of the of the base so

195
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
yeah and that's how you know that it's

196
00:13:51,839 --> 00:14:12,149
not very well calibrated so this this

197
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,360
was my first prototype it was basically

198
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,629
just the LED is trying to for so to say

199
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,899
and you just have to rotate the board to

200
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:29,399
keep it on the on the top the problem is

201
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,980
I still have this program here but

202
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,019
because because of the density we're

203
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,569
chasing this one so you can try this

204
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,049
game actually

205
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,190
so you have much more facilities but

206
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,290
because it was limited to the edges here

207
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,960
by the way it's a ecocide one which

208
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,370
means it volume with 20 faces and then

209
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,050
it got its isolated

210
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,099
[Music]

211
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:32,830
I'm Russian you have to know as the same

212
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,160
effect you have to correct the pills and

213
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,390
you have to avoid as well as a ghost you

214
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,770
can use it with no interaction at all so

215
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,310
this artist who I was willing to have on

216
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,950
the on the stand as you as it was

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,100
playing so okay so it I suggest as a

218
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,529
decoration device but it's nice as well

219
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:08,020
so what I plan to do next is a little

220
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,310
website just to to make it more visible

221
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,600
but more importantly is a wiki because I

222
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,220
didn't mention it but it's a free

223
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,380
open-source so both hardware and

224
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,870
software are supposed to be open source

225
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,950
so in the wiki we I want to make also

226
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,300
knowledge database like the step-by-step

227
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,350
instruction to to make this version of

228
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,560
the herb everything like what do you

229
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,750
insult the wiki hot spot inside in the

230
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,990
raspberry P so I want I wanted to

231
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,720
actually dental project turns or on this

232
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,740
wiki as well I want to make a game e+ e

233
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,890
like lecture store but it would be or of

234
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,890
course free so that people can can share

235
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,800
their games because one one of the main

236
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,160
interests of the of the project is that

237
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,000
we can try to discover new game plays

238
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,980
because it's a unique interface and as

239
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,400
well there would be a see you later so

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,380
that if you don't have the device you

241
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,319
can still test the games on as well as

242
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,140
you develop the game the game she too

243
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,420
could be simpler so

244
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,570
here's basic very fun but I mean you

245
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,870
just have the boy in a 3d space

246
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,200
and because it's lower so it can be

247
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,700
compiled to JavaScript with an script M

248
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,930
so I could run through our games inside

249
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,720
the browser that's why I would make them

250
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:58,150
the situation to watch insects but sorry

251
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,480
to through bad things up so you can

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,840
build a device I mean you can do

253
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,840
everything I want to make food base

254
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,250
because the contrast between the cores

255
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,890
and the ruler or I think that that could

256
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,510
be beautiful but any ID you can even

257
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,830
make a cube out of it's alike yeah you

258
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,680
could this of course is important for

259
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,320
the games because as you have different

260
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,740
topologies so how can you ensure that

261
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,530
your games are still playable with one

262
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,140
topology or another so that some things

263
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,090
to to think about because because the

264
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,570
Raspberry Pi as a speaker Jack also we

265
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,360
can do speakers we can do audio things

266
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:02,140
we also program again what happy API is

267
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,750
unstable because I don't really know

268
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,660
what what we what would be useful as a

269
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,780
programmer to to access to so as yeah as

270
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,620
I will and maybe you as well do more

271
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,650
games so we will be able to concern

272
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,780
either the API as well other stuff like

273
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,370
so external matter as a small

274
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,210
interruption model for when you tap on

275
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,420
the enjoy accelerometer so you could as

276
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,000
well make an input of that like you are

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,090
just

278
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,970
being able to validate something so yet

279
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,039
seems to discover salsa well if this is

280
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,159
my would plan and but if you are

281
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,000
interested into the project so so of

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,350
course the documentation as I said

283
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,350
there's a wiki like I really want it to

284
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,640
be easy to do to step in like ok here is

285
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,860
how you make one here is how you program

286
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,490
it like with tutorials step-by-step

287
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,650
instructions and so I really want you to

288
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,440
make a lot of effort and the

289
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:20,059
documentation as well for for myself I

290
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,429
generally use the MIT license but I'm

291
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,820
not I mean I don't know that much about

292
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,700
the licenses and the free open source

293
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,630
stuff so yeah there will be something to

294
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,399
to do here as well yeah so if you want

295
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:43,789
to use it so just review a message or at

296
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,620
the end of the talk just come by

297
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:15,160
so we have time for our questions also

298
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,340
for the citrus part did I use the farm

299
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,670
up so and there's a library for

300
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,750
controlling the LED strip in which which

301
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,450
is called the FP underscore ws2812 like

302
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,630
the name of the LED and I've made the

303
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,260
drivers for the sensor card because it's

304
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,559
connected in a I to see and there's a

305
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,220
run a driver as I mean iPhone no no way

306
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,830
to communicate from the library I mean

307
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,890
so I made some libraries but there is no

308
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,370
joy goes sorry servicing from oh I use a

309
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:12,370
GL m for the mad stuff I just need to

310
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,590
have the accelerometer to have the up

311
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,010
axis and then I take the digital compass

312
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,550
to to have the loss axis and then I do a

313
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:28,030
cross product you have the base but one

314
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,780
thing a really program and the game so

315
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,120
LEDs are indexes but you shouldn't rely

316
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,250
on them to to make some more hardcore

317
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,650
decision like when you go to the lead

318
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,830
number 21 it happens same thing because

319
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,030
and as you could do the same device but

320
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,550
with another mapping for the LEDs so for

321
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,920
the mapping I have also you are script

322
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,060
which defines the mapping but what's

323
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,160
actually useful each LED has a list of

324
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,760
its neighbors so that's why you can just

325
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:33,830
jump over the things and plan to

326
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,340
increase the density of the LEDs and do

327
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,630
I want to make your screen out of that

328
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,890
[Laughter]

329
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,990
[Music]

330
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm actually not not against finding a

331
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,640
kind of the mini pollution like how to

332
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,400
make that so it's using injected modes

333
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,390
instead of yeah curve the police even

334
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,580
stuff like that but so yeah yeah there

335
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,010
is something to do with yeah small

336
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,550
pollutants

337
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:26,549
yes I could have a portable computer I

338
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,919
mean it was always meant to be a game

339
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:54,520
sorry actually another question I'm

340
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,070
actually a fan of multiplayer games as a

341
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,110
mostly local multiplayer games and there

342
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,000
are little bit sad that so this device

343
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,660
can be easily given so you can't give

344
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,910
that easily to another player or maybe

345
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,100
there will be games that involved that

346
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,340
but you can't destroy it because most of

347
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,260
the people when they saw it for the

348
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,120
first time as I say oh I want to insure

349
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,760
the ball so now you guys Vijaya

350
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,090
but unlike mutiple could be as

351
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,610
registration this this would imply that

352
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,799
us many people have this device for

353
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,000
follow it's not the case but

354
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,530
you
