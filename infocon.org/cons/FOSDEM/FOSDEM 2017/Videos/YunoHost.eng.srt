1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,050
hello everyone

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,420
thanks for being here I'm going to give

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,340
you a presentation of why you note that

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,500
we can summarize very quickly a system

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,299
administration for everyone or cell

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,970
fasting for everyone this conference is

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,310
going to be a bit technical made me a

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,310
bit more than the other one but I was

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,560
making a conference for for them I was

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,710
going to be ok for you very short three

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,050
me I'm a software developer and not as

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,270
easy man in straighter and maybe a key

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,590
points is that I'm coming for quite

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,430
pretty guys background in regard to

15
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,020
privacy net neutrality in this kind of

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,070
thing has been involved in the

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,930
quadrature du net a student group that

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,640
fight for those question during three

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,720
years but before explaining you why you

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,829
know so I'm just going to give you a

21
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,800
very short story of what our you know

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,270
started because I think this is the best

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,219
way to understand why is attack that

24
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:59,660
today in 2011 but Bernie stan is own

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,559
mail server and a crowd we fight on here

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,409
wanted the same code is not a system

27
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,000
administrator but but the system

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,520
investor they realized that replicating

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,530
this kind of configuration was very hard

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,070
and very boring at that time so I like

31
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,380
every good developer crowd started to

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,380
program a solution and they made the

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,790
first reason in 2000 2012 and starting

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,500
at this point feature this startup grown

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,360
and grown and grown so from image we

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,869
went to XMPP to managing several domains

37
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,439
to application which is just free

38
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,290
software from web that winds up in fix

39
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,939
occur what price maybe a week either

40
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,000
quickly and those kind of thing

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,650
single sign-on etter etc etc but it's

42
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,180
important to know that also these kind

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,369
of people and in France we live in a

44
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:55,909
very politicized context regarding this

45
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,829
kind of development there is a lot of

46
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,659
organization that you see some of them

47
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,720
would present today and the government

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,030
has very very aggressive against this

49
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,090
kind of thing against internet so self

50
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,810
hosting surveillance privacy is a

51
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,999
political context for France in the free

52
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,590
software community since a long time

53
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,490
my nose has been developed

54
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,780
in that context but what is very most

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,000
yep a full view I guess most system

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,070
administrator winos is going to look

57
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,920
like that or key interface this is the I

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,070
mean interface Hawaii knows you can see

59
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,930
a part of a future address it at for you

60
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,270
you can manage user every user is going

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,670
to have is own email account by default

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,150
several domain inside application backup

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,680
is integrated so you see this is really

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,710
kind of common CSM ionisation things

65
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,820
that you do this is just to show you the

66
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,950
list of application that we got so we

67
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,230
get a solution for most of the common

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,540
quite shusuke that you cannot win on the

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
internet not all those are here so virus

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,310
is not very interesting right now but

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,770
just to give you a decal and wiki

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,690
control we just moved to next crowd

73
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,330
file-sharing forum this kind of thing

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,930
chat and just to give you an idea on how

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,110
easy to easy it is to use it this is

76
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,970
just via installation of an application

77
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,760
you just say I want to name it like that

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,010
I just choose the domain of the domain I

79
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,680
got dominate subdomain are the same

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,750
thing and address choose a path of

81
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,340
installation and after it's custom

82
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,320
option for the application and you just

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,030
click install and that's done and just

84
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,590
some advanced that feature that we got

85
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,740
just to give you an idea again diagnosis

86
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,110
monitoring is very simple for a firewall

87
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,450
we kind of common thing that you find in

88
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,170
system administration and last but not

89
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,900
least for most of a user for which we

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,180
get single sign-on so you sign only once

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,580
and you get a nice interface with big

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,130
button to get to your application we

93
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,970
were having to log again so that's why

94
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,580
you knows and before going like in the

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,240
next subject

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,810
I just want to rephrase it like that

97
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,050
winos

98
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,270
is a thin layer on top of system and

99
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,670
nutation operation that you do most of

100
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,709
the time things you were going to do by

101
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,980
hand are now done by the way most anyone

102
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,510
knows the extensible if you need to

103
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,700
and this is both of a technical user

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,320
that want to modify things that are not

105
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,510
up here and the way we make things up to

106
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,330
be over you can diffuser that aren't

107
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,260
technical expert in this kind of

108
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,640
situation we got several user that just

109
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,650
never launched a terminal to use why you

110
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,070
noticed they still got a tech friend in

111
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,490
case things go wrong but I get several

112
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,290
for example Pooh you was doing the

113
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,690
torque on free of Commerce oft never

114
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,220
launched a terminal to manages were you

115
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,510
know server now I'm going to give a bit

116
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,340
into the core for you knows how things

117
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,020
are working for you to understand since

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,170
we are at Folsom one of the key point of

119
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,640
fairness is that everything you do on

120
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,950
the web and mean interface you can do on

121
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,170
the command line interface this is just

122
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,150
a very simple example the main listing

123
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,650
so all the domain that I get on this

124
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,110
application same thing on the click

125
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,250
interface

126
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,750
you got a command that is called ye

127
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,270
knows where in those domain list of

128
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,690
common any this is just this and you

129
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,000
have all those operations so you are not

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,980
trapped in the web interface you can do

131
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,450
things from the command line interface

132
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,350
and that's done because the way we

133
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,030
programmer eNOS is extremely simple

134
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,720
actually

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,300
it should crack a bit a very simple web

136
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,030
framework we just define an entry point

137
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,650
so this is the listing of all the domain

138
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,470
and we dick share it on the other side

139
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,170
as a REST API and three point and as a

140
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,470
clean interface and that's all and so we

141
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,700
can extend well you know very easily

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,070
because the design is very flat a very

143
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,530
auto gunner just to give you another

144
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,690
idea

145
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,570
those are all the module for you knows

146
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,280
that are just simple Python file with

147
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,500
simple function definition in them and

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,990
that gives you a list of operation that

149
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,540
you can use after so that make a very

150
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,300
very simple architectural design and a

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,460
very extensible one and to continue in

152
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,260
the architecture just to give you again

153
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,490
an ID on Wow awareness is made in yellow

154
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,530
this is the thing that we make in green

155
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,240
this is the interface for the user and

156
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,430
we notice this this is the code I were

157
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,440
just showing you this is a simple Python

158
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,190
thing simple

159
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,020
code that is going to manage your server

160
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,820
and makes the operation that you asked

161
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,900
him to do so you know 200 port right on

162
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,240
key interface rest API so for video

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,340
though this is the kind of operation and

164
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,380
the single sign-on has been designed as

165
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,130
a Lua

166
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,120
nginx module so for Ingenix you can

167
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,160
extend it programming in you are so you

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,070
are convinced that you will get every

169
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,650
whicker's that come to your server so

170
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,420
this is a very good guarantee of having

171
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,080
an efficient system and every

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,070
application depending on the

173
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,620
configuration other requests fit by the

174
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,650
SSO so we are fine with that NGSS so is

175
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,290
made using adapt like every one and

176
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,540
every user in this database is going to

177
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,840
get a mare and XMPP accounts and to

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,460
continue to give you an idea on how are

179
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,740
you know cease mail regarding

180
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,470
application some people understand

181
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,690
application as package like debian

182
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,400
package but that's around the same thing

183
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,770
at all applications is more like a layer

184
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,900
on the top that give things that

185
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,700
configuration installation removing

186
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,100
upgrade and this kind of thing and again

187
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,040
why knows which was a very simple design

188
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,100
for that an application is basically a

189
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,440
J's manifested JSON in which you dig try

190
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,780
your application so name the kind of

191
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,060
thing and you list the argumentation

192
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,950
that you want to receive administration

193
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,290
of the application I hope this is big

194
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,169
enough for you to read and you get your

195
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,270
manifest.json you get the script folder

196
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,330
and in which you put several shell

197
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,210
script install remove at the mandatory

198
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,280
one you ever wanna optional but i

199
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,860
recommended since once you modify your

200
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,510
application you want to make upgrade and

201
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,130
backup restore a very cruel to to dig a

202
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,390
bit inside of it this is how we walk so

203
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,490
the installation application interface

204
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,919
I'll just show you before so you know

205
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,630
name the main and certain this kind of

206
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,270
thing what it kind of manifestation

207
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,789
before and you insert scrip is just

208
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,290
going to receive this kind of thing as

209
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,280
bash variables so to say it again why

210
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,990
you knows if you are system

211
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,820
administrator that knows are to install

212
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,080
by end

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,510
an application what press or this kind

214
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,790
of thing this is extremely simple for

215
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,740
you to make an application for ye knows

216
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,350
you just need to run some very short

217
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,690
commands like I want to register this

218
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,640
domain and inside Mourinho's and that's

219
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,260
what after is the critical things you

220
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,680
make geek Kron use your own Ingenix

221
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,330
configuration for this application etc

222
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,510
it's right strong so against min pune

223
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,730
for you knows fin a year on top of an

224
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,070
MIT system administration easy to use

225
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,990
easy to extend so just I've told you a

226
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,600
lot of a feature already but undo one

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,850
that I haven't talked about we know of

228
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,200
latexing let's encrypt and an

229
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,900
integration for domain we offered in

230
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,030
darkness for free domain if you don't

231
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,280
have anyone we have advanced search

232
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,810
feature for people that wants to modify

233
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,640
owners so we have things that we call

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,700
regen come so for regeneration

235
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,650
regeneration of configuration so if we

236
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,210
saw that you modify configuration that

237
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,010
we take care of we're not going to

238
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,220
override it I just told you is the deep

239
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,190
of that same thing we got okay

240
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,290
so 5u operation or good part of the

241
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,090
operation you can call script before or

242
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,810
after if you want to extend why you lost

243
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,850
and again if you don't want to do any

244
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,120
kind of thing that I you don't have to

245
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,450
we also a firewall facto ban and we try

246
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,860
to be quite cool as possible on security

247
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,420
backups from more routine monitoring as

248
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,120
as you can see code been varying stone

249
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,380
stable things are growing and growing

250
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,250
and growing so this is website on which

251
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,900
I talk about the thing I don't talk

252
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,160
about because it's not the most

253
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,170
technical part but this is very

254
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,320
important for us this is our token but

255
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,850
we can estimate that we get between

256
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,150
1,000 and 2,000 user from very technical

257
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,000
people to not very technical people from

258
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
people that just manage a group of their

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,140
friends to people that just manage on

260
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,500
server reckon which is very friendly and

261
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,160
we really like it we want to give more

262
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,270
power to this community to allow it to

263
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,710
to contribute more to inodes to be

264
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,150
involved in to where you know that will

265
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,800
be feedback to us

266
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,190
the thing that we walk on right now we

267
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,180
get 20 official up this is growing there

268
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,170
is 63 community apps that are written

269
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,250
declare as been walking for a total of

270
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,550
adobo fingers growing because we met a

271
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,380
lot of work on the application again

272
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,940
this is very easy for people to make

273
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,740
application they want to involve a

274
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,690
community to be able to add the things

275
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,560
they want to we are collective we don't

276
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,260
have any chief and EDD often heard that

277
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,029
we are self-organized we have our own

278
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,360
rule that we written together we

279
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,399
recently met continuous integration for

280
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,200
application to burn tea that when you

281
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,760
got back up and think that things are

282
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,690
going to work after we made a huge huge

283
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,769
list of tests for that this is our

284
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,620
recent work on this side we are saying

285
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,380
who is introduced up level so level of

286
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,519
quality of application because

287
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,589
application I've good a big part of my

288
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,050
nose but not the only one I wanted to

289
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,839
give both for our user an indication of

290
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
what they can expect for an application

291
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,850
and for a developer of application a

292
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,930
roadmap to follow and something that is

293
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,450
motivating they can just win novel and

294
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,130
when they reach level 6 again propose

295
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,260
the application to be official yeah I'll

296
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,240
community gather in a forum and expect a

297
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,410
chat room and this is quite active we

298
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,390
have transition but not enough

299
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,329
transition so if you speak thing over

300
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,579
than French and English please come

301
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,950
we got German that is quite okay but

302
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,420
neither a little bit mode of flow of

303
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,459
same for Spanish and for Portuguese and

304
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,800
every other language that you want there

305
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
is India too but I think the people that

306
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,860
was working on the stop and sub G for a

307
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,949
lot of initiative started in France

308
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,899
things are a bit up to extract from

309
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,420
France because French people speak of

310
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,040
very bad English even worse than me

311
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,360
so yeah if you come to violinist

312
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,890
expect French that's not a disease but

313
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,110
expect this kind of thing we try to make

314
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,820
it more open for other people but this

315
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,620
is a work that takes time especially

316
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,210
because we touch

317
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,330
we reach our people people that are not

318
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,880
extremely technically savvy so those

319
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,140
people are not the people that are going

320
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,750
to speak English very well in France but

321
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,460
still we are very open to other kind of

322
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,649
community just to tell you why he knows

323
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,110
as I've told you is a thin layer to make

324
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,110
system initiation my way more easier so

325
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,120
we are connected with a lot of a project

326
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,670
so first one is the next talk talk and

327
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,770
not talking about this is basically how

328
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,830
to distribute Aquino's isn't in without

329
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,660
where I'll be tagged freedombox but not

330
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,600
exactly that freedombox the federation

331
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,220
of our city of IP that was a previous

332
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,870
talk some people are looking on say hey

333
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
maybe we can use way nodes to give you a

334
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,130
package to create your own I speak very

335
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,050
easily

336
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,580
Kumasi after chateau this talk has been

337
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,930
done before

338
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,240
chateau is the collective of people that

339
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,020
are making a hosting of free software on

340
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,430
the medics nice I got the beginning I

341
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,870
saw one people on three that was saying

342
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,990
oh I'm using Windows so I think thing

343
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm moving in that direction why not

344
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,920
come acid is also talking about winos as

345
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,470
a way to move out of home a certain to

346
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,660
replicate from ass off for you or group

347
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,880
of friends if things are at the

348
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,920
beginning so it's in discussion is not

349
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,740
Garrity right now but to give you an

350
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,270
idea that when you start to look a bit

351
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,580
AK someone of a core component on how we

352
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,620
can make this kind of thing so

353
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,360
installation they began and you don't

354
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,130
know the scripture and just creep is the

355
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,750
raspberry purely makes this kind of

356
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,860
thing you can expect and I think we want

357
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,089
to do is enormous

358
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,650
there is a lot a lot a lot of thing to

359
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,100
do so we need app we need up in not of

360
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,890
subject as I've told you we got a very

361
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,900
friendly community I will try to be a

362
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,980
very friendly team not having fun doing

363
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,750
that we are all volunteer we not air to

364
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,520
kill herself but we all believe this is

365
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,660
important things to do as I said back

366
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,550
and spite on luau if you want to work on

367
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,190
VSS so from Ted hm ideas if you know

368
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,079
these are new uux this is the kind of

369
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,410
thing where you can make a good impact

370
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,420
application I just saw you bash

371
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,339
security if you like security in code

372
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,110
review I have part of the code I want

373
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,649
people to

374
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,990
look at infrastructure we have a debian

375
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,519
building torchin that is something that

376
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,829
is not very easy to enter so if you know

377
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,869
this kind of thing we react - we have

378
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,970
some Ruby code running around so if you

379
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,410
like Ruby and community again community

380
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,360
translation documentation this is the

381
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,449
kind of 20% that we our developer are

382
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,879
not able to do we do view above 80% but

383
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,220
those are the last 20% that make a real

384
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,769
difference for other people and we want

385
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,660
to make a difference for other people so

386
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,670
if you like this kind of thing join us

387
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,899
we are very open to that and yeah we got

388
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,369
a bit assessing so if you want to test

389
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,759
the beta looks more like not real better

390
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,100
but just make sure that in your super

391
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,929
special ed cash things are not going to

392
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,509
break because we make a lot of code

393
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,129
review a lot of testing before merging

394
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,050
anything in the beta so it's not that

395
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,429
much like a beta and just to finish is a

396
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,610
link of a thing that might interest you

397
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,990
we get a developer example beta vroom so

398
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,790
if you want to join us just commenting

399
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,279
us and those are the other link that

400
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,220
might interest you

401
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,480
thanks for your time I have any

402
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,140
questions

403
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:59,980
[Applause]

404
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,180
fine yep

405
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,480
no not right now so do we want to make

406
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,240
our tools Debian package so the coffer

407
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,710
you knows so why no Schoen mean

408
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,970
interface and all those kind of thing at

409
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,619
the beyond package are we our own

410
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,349
we got your own Debian repository and we

411
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,940
build things ourselves

412
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,970
we haven't planted yet to be integrated

413
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,069
fully into Debian because it's not the

414
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,750
kind of thing that the team currently is

415
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,940
about to end or and not maybe if kind of

416
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,470
thing that we want to do because we have

417
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,500
a very short recycle right now every two

418
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,970
months free mum something like that so

419
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,440
that's not the kind of thing we want to

420
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:56,690
do right now maybe right so what is our

421
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,700
strategy for backups backups it's

422
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,070
actually a very complicated subject

423
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,750
right now we only generate a zip file

424
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,210
that you get with all your thing this is

425
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,580
not optimal right now the two that

426
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,440
everyone is using for making backup is

427
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,560
called Bongo bog backup we plan to

428
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,570
integrate it directly into your very

429
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,120
nose so you know this is a backup of SSH

430
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,100
with the duplication encryption and this

431
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,610
kind of thing very well made this is the

432
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,600
idea right now but backup you know

433
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,310
backup is not that our restoring is very

434
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,190
very odd does we very very you know

435
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,310
everyone look at the github of fast Cola

436
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,950
last week so this is the kind of thing

437
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,020
that we need to think a lot about and

438
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,560
make a lot of experiment to get it right

439
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,690
but yeah so that our current strategy

440
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,100
right now and we're working on that

441
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:59,820
does anyone got another question yes I

442
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,469
can write it in any language so what is

443
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,899
the dependency for an application so

444
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:11,070
right now it's just executing a fire so

445
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,239
technically you could write it in

446
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,129
another language that in bash

447
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,549
we choose to use bash script by default

448
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:19,229
because this is the easier way for

449
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,779
people to enter a commit application we

450
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,669
got prototype to lodge and civil to you

451
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:26,639
do application so it's quite extensible

452
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,779
we are open to this kind of discussion

453
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:32,190
so those come if you want to make this

454
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,889
in another way

455
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:56,519
yes so the question is can you use what

456
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,839
you know someone server and manage

457
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,629
understand of us along with it no right

458
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:03,570
now my nose is a very thin layer to do

459
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,039
common things that you would do we have

460
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,479
a sheet other things to do and this is

461
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,799
not the kind of thing that we are

462
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,929
looking right now but you know things

463
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,279
are open so if you want to do this kind

464
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,710
of thing just come in to talk to us

465
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:33,780
another question yes so the question is

466
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,970
is in a road map to put all the

467
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,670
application that from a soft has been

468
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,440
promoting to winos yes it's a reciter

469
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,750
your road map in red mine saying yeah we

470
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,230
want to do that

471
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,880
we already got quite a lot of percentage

472
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,490
of that I can try to look at it but I

473
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,090
don't know if this is going to work and

474
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,870
this is writing 909 is not always very

475
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:04,980
happy so application issue but this is a

476
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,490
real one yeah so we got we are here we

477
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,110
get 13 application on front on 31 right

478
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,590
now and we really want to make to put on

479
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,440
application of from a certain side why

480
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,630
you know stand Hamas is also interested

481
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,250
by that and they want to give one alpha

482
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,900
day one day we per week to Luke who is

483
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,700
not here anymore which will be system

484
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,320
administrator to do this kind of thing

485
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,610
so yeah when does one of Eid if you

486
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,170
manage to a synchronously from a sub

487
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,820
that would be a we want to replicate

488
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,310
from a soft at your place you can use

489
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:51,950
very knows for small community yes

490
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:56,360
so the distaff application that you saw

491
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,720
at the beginning is just a story in a

492
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,389
JSON file on our server so I just took

493
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,399
the logon apesh and just take like two

494
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,559
days and rest yeah so it's unique on the

495
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,049
IP addresses and that looks like a one

496
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,759
thousand six hundred and something like

497
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,429
that but things is really moving in

498
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,889
another way and we not re interested in

499
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,080
spying to our user it's not really the

500
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,629
kind of thing we want to do yes

501
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,150
so if if I understand correctly is the

502
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,590
question is is it going to make a

503
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:54,060
virtual host yes I think they really

504
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,740
depend on so is the way not going to

505
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,730
fight with my already existing

506
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,030
installation there is quite some chance

507
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,970
it really depends on what you've made

508
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,710
but for example if you were using Apache

509
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,200
you can just proxy Apache be an engineer

510
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,540
use nginx and you just have to

511
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,880
decreasing the SSO to say that two

512
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,790
visitors don't take care about that so

513
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,870
there is a way to put weariness in it

514
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,100
but this has been fought at the

515
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,620
beginning to not take part of your

516
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,940
system but just make a first

517
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,760
installation after you customize it but

518
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,770
if you if you want we can just talk

519
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:36,020
about it see if it's possible yes

520
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,340
you

521
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,320
so the question is do we add any

522
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,720
additional security to the tool we

523
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,120
packaged in very nosed

524
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,090
so this is the lead to a cage developer

525
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,450
we want so we have we are writing right

526
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,340
now the specification and now you should

527
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,170
make a good application in this kind of

528
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,100
thing yeah we said we want good security

529
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,990
but for Nardo's a common classical unix

530
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,910
practice or one user per application one

531
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,090
at a base per application read-only file

532
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,290
for PHP because HP you know this kind of

533
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,510
thing so we not we haven't went full

534
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,940
crazy with apparmor or as a Linux or

535
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,450
this kind of thing

536
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,270
so very very quickly so vacation was

537
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,310
actually if there is a silver van

538
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,910
operating on application how do we

539
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,050
inform our user and how do we end our

540
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,530
situation so there is a feed right now

541
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,080
saying zero security information you

542
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,110
should upgrade this package or this way

543
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,330
we have all right to the right to right

544
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,240
to modify every application as I

545
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,710
maintain but some people but when there

546
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,210
is a security issue we make the

547
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,560
modification as soon as possible

548
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,310
sorry time is up but yeah I am supposed

549
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,350
to be different manager to say gotta

550
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,380
load this for me

551
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:58,359
