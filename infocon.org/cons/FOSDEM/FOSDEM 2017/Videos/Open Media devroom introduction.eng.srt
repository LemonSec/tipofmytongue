00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,889
introduction of what we'll be doing

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,670
today so the open biggity-boom

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,939
is in its third year here at for them so

7
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,050
we've had two successful years already

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,850
it has a large range of topics as you

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,330
can see rendering from standards to

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,689
applications and all of those topics are

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,400
more or less reflected in the planning

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,799
we have today the responses of the room

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,320

18
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,040
so today's planning roughly divided in

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,290
four parts the first part would be about

20
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,190
web delivery in the lab sense then we

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,159
have a part on frameworks so gstreamer

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,670
g-pack and you pipe this year the third

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,130
part the other part is about codecs and

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,760
formats also in a large sense and we

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,850
finished with standards for what

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,360

31
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,330

a new product I don't know about it's a

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,159
iced hooked that allows to define a

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,640
format to to pass binary structure or

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,159
talk on the status update on the new

40
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,820
codec or 81 and also token 1313 is also

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,950
