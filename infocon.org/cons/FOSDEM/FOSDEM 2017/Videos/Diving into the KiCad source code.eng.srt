00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,620
hello everyone my name is Matthias

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,540
Minsky some of you may know me as our

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,930
son I work at CERN and for the past few

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,760
years I have been regularly contributing

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,090
to kicad and I'm going to stay to start

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,730
with a maybe not very humble statement

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,890
but I think kicad is really great tool

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,930
it has a lot of awesome awesome

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,800
utilities and it also has a text format

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,460
which is which is a good thing because

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,010
it plays well we've mentioned we've get

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,720
with other service version control but

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,360
it's also abused in certain ways because

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
due to due to the nature of human

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
readable formats people are tempted to

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,239
change the manually or or write external

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,379
scripts that that well do do what is

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,379
missing in kicad the problem is when you

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,680
manually edit a file well it's a

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,750
one-time solution when you write an

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,750
external script well it solves your

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,149
problem but then it's not usual it's not

23
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:15,869
very well Alberto advertised and if the

24
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,700
file for my changes you need to fix it

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,849
and stuff like that so perhaps maybe a

26
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,030
better idea would be to write code there

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,940
is a 40-cal have the problem solved once

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,030
and for all and you know give back to

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,490
community and have everyone take

30
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,490
advantage of that so today I would like

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,130
to tell you how is it done in kicad how

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,869
easy how easy is the interface for

33
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,709
creating key tools and to start with we

34
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,530
need to know how to build kicad it's not

35
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,770
a very big deal then a few words about

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,660
the tool framework I think that's the

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,190
main point here the interface for

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,190
creating key tools a few useful classes

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,550
so so you know what you can use for for

40
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,950
dealing with certain problems you want

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,459
writing tools a short example to see how

42
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,580
does it look like in real a few words

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,038
about what you can do when you when you

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,079
are finished in the tool and then some

45
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,560
further information if you need if you

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,849
if you need it

47
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,409
so building Kitcat is really quite

48
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,439
straightforward for linux in to install

49
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,989
dependencies it's just a bunch of

50
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,939
libraries that usual you can get with

51
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,650
your packet package manager of choice

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,769
and then these these five comments will

53
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,900
get you work we'll get you a binary and

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,879
well that's a good starting point for

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,810
further development for Windows it seems

56
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,180
to be harder but since emphasis to

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,400
people since emesis two people created a

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,439
really good environment for development

59
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,510
under Windows it's really almost the

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,609
same thing you just install certain

61
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,389
packages and actually it's even shorter

62
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,370
than then within those you have three

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,189
comments here so it's really easy to

64
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,650
start okay so for the tool framework the

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,299
tool framework is currently only

66
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,879
available for pcbnew but we are going to

67
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,579
port it to the schematics editor as well

68
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,189
to have the well the same way for

69
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,840
creating tools in in both applications

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,909
and probably share some of the code

71
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:29,169
there are three major subsystems this is

72
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,090
down to two speed responsibilities to

73
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,370
keep the code cleaner

74
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,209
the first one is view it handles display

75
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,889
displaying objects in the rendering

76
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,299
process then you have model so all kinds

77
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,280
of items that you can find either either

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,750
on your board on or on schematics and

79
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,400
then the tool framework which is the

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,609
code that modifies the model the world

81
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,400
the thing that that you are going to

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,419
work with so here's the basic skeleton

83
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:06,010
for a tool there is a base class called

84
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,099
PCB tool and from that you have to

85
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,319
implement only a few functions to create

86
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,599
a new tool as if every C++ class there's

87
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,668
a constructor and destructor nothing Q

88
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,918
is special here you can initializer

89
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,099
or free or resources then there's a

90
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,590
reset method where you can react to

91
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,130
certain events for example when you

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,120
first started

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,080
or or when the model is reloaded so for

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,820
example if you keep pointers it probably

95
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,350
you need to update them because they

96
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,180
might be not valid anymore

97
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,400
or when the rendering engine is switched

98
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,919
and so on so we have a chance to react

99
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,040
here before anything bad happens then

100
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
there is also the init init method and

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,870
it is different from the constructor in

102
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,230
that matter that all the other tools are

103
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,169
already created when the init method is

104
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,720
called so if you need to cooperate with

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,729
something else that's the right moment

106
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,160
to use the tool manager I will show you

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,360
later visit to a manager to to use

108
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,430
another tool and there are also

109
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,460
transitions the state transitions method

110
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,639
associate even handlers with particular

111
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,360
methods in the class so if you have a

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,010
let's say here as in the in this example

113
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,880
if even a arrives then even handler is

114
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,460
responsible for handling for handling

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,240
the event and here's an example even

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,510
handler there are two main ways of

117
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,110
implementing handlers one is a single

118
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,710
action so if there is an event you

119
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,070
perform a certain certain list of

120
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,770
operation and you finish like you can

121
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,169
change position maybe rotate sleep or

122
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,830
stuff like that or you can write

123
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,740
interactive tools and here you can you

124
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,139
can have a wire loop you can keep

125
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,090
receiving events until you decide that

126
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,210
you are done so so for example if you if

127
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,970
you want to create a drawing tool first

128
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,400
you obtain the first click position then

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,220
you wait for another one then you can

130
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,130
draw a line between them and until the

131
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,070
user decides to cancel the tool or well

132
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,080
it's up to you apart for from creating

133
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,460
new tool I mean coding it into you need

134
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,520
to add it to the project and kicad is a

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,909
civic so so for that you need to modify

136
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,340
see make lists you need to just add your

137
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,990
file there and you also need to

138
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,139
notify PCB PCB know that there is a new

139
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,050
tool that you can use and for that you

140
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,289
just need in this particular file you

141
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,569
just add a new header if your if your

142
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,139
tool and this is this function and

143
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,120
really that's it it's in total three

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,229
lines for this training a new tool about

145
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,419
useful classes everything everything in

146
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,199
kicad that you can modify I mean for

147
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,210
model is based on EDA item it's a quite

148
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,990
vast hierarchy so so here I can only

149
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,110
show you the items we are related to

150
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,050
layout there's the base class boy like

151
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,630
them and then well but most of the

152
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,270
classes are I think self-explanatory you

153
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,090
have past tracks wires zones

154
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,000
well maybe not info item is it's not a

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,900
clear thing but it's a data structure

156
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,580
that holds information about nets so you

157
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,360
can check their their name or net code

158
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,070
probably you will also need that needed

159
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,970
at certain point then when it comes to

160
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,750
the UI interface

161
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,130
which are called friends in in wxwidgets

162
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,880
nomenclature so here again I had

163
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,040
restrict the hierarchy only to the

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,810
bottle board related related classes but

165
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,450
it's also I think quite clear what every

166
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,740
every of the class does and most likely

167
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,020
both luck likely you're going to work

168
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,020
with the these two guys one is the

169
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,969
footprint deterrent the other one is

170
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,490
layout editor and usually this is the

171
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,540
place where were you at your tools then

172
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,450
we also have a notion of commit we

173
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,850
realized that there are when writing

174
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,770
tools there are certain parts of code

175
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,010
that are repeated for example when you

176
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,190
add a new item then you need to create

177
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,290
an undue entry so it can be reverted

178
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,820
later update the board update you well

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,220
if you are modifying connected items

180
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,030
then arsons has to be updated so avoid

181
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,120
so in order to avoid problems potential

182
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,490
problems that that probably would happen

183
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,220
if someone forgot about one of these

184
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,240
operations we created commit and if you

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
are familiar with be it probably it

186
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,990
looks quite clear create a commit then

187
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,510
you decide what what kind of changes you

188
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,280
want to introduce either creating new

189
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,330
items removing them for modification you

190
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,010
need to first say that save the state

191
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,170
because if you first modify the item and

192
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,880
then you save the state and well it's

193
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,400
it's already too late for for storing

194
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,720
changes and then once it's pushed come

195
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,190
it takes care of updating all the

196
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,020
interested parties so that's it about

197
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,190
notifying other subsystems there are

198
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,560
also two actions to actually represent

199
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
an activity that you can perform in

200
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,120
pcbnew so for example if you are writing

201
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,020
an action to to flip a component a to

202
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,390
flip the selection you just create a

203
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,510
collection that is named usually in a in

204
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,709
a way at first you have

205
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,369
the tool the application then there's

206
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:29,889
the parent tool and there's the the

207
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,470
action that is performed you can decide

208
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,170
whether the action is doable so it for

209
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,839
example it can apply to all tools or it

210
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,790
might be just related to a certain tool

211
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,220
so you can limit the scope and you can

212
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,720
also define hotkey if you want a label

213
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,459
that is going to appear if you are going

214
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,740
to edit menu due to like a right-click

215
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,470
context menu and a hint that will appear

216
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,110
when you hover over the mouse over the

217
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,730
entry and perhaps naik and if you want

218
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,740
and last but not least is the tool

219
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,779
manager and the tool manager is the

220
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,800
class the that this is the class

221
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,410
available for for every tool in pcbnew

222
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,369
and it has dual role versus to let you

223
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:20,290
interact with other tools for example if

224
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,360
you need to or if you need to know what

225
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,019
is selected then you just ask the

226
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,300
selection tool for the currently

227
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,170
selected set of items or maybe you can

228
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,559
decide to clear the current selection

229
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,819
whatever you just need to see what other

230
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,749
tools offer and it also allows you to

231
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:45,309
access the access objects that you are

232
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,679
going to use when writing tools view if

233
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,889
you want to add some some drawings model

234
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:53,759
for modifying the the board itself or

235
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,019
edit frame if you want to deal with the

236
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,920
user interface so now to see an example

237
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,429
I decided to create a simple tool just

238
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,879
to illustrate how it's done in kicad and

239
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,699
it's going to be a fan-out tool so if

240
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,029
you have a high pin count package it's

241
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,160
just impossible to route all the pads

242
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,069
using a single layer so instead you need

243
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:22,329
to draw a short piece of track and use a

244
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,970
via tool to use other layers for for

245
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,360
routing so our tour is go our tool is

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,059
going to create all the tracks and vias

247
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,699
and after that the routing should be

248
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,569
much easier for you

249
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,879
the code that I'm going to show in a

250
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,040
moment is currently available on

251
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,850
launchpad

252
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,579
so if you want to study it or maybe I

253
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,310
don't know upgrade it because it's a

254
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,769
very simple to write now then you are

255
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:57,610
free to have a look at it so here we

256
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,059
have the header file it really resembles

257
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,519
the one that I have shown you before

258
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,160
well there's the constructor there's

259
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,139
even no need for for destructor we just

260
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:16,029
have the free methods read in it and set

261
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,850
transitions one even Handler and we'll

262
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,550
have also a context menu so for that we

263
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,480
are just stirring the the pointer to

264
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,769
there to the menu that we are going to

265
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,220
create and the more more interesting

266
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,839
part is the CPP file so skipping the

267
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,879
license it's important thing don't

268
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,290
forget about it when you are writing

269
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,879
code first you add all the headers that

270
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,149
you are going to use there are a few

271
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,189
that probably you are going to use in in

272
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,990
most of the tools like to Elections

273
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,149
manual store manager and commit then

274
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,949
because we are going to deal with

275
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,980
modules you need to know about the class

276
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,519
that is going to be modified and I want

277
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,740
to also involve selection tool because I

278
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,839
want to operate on the object that is

279
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,649
currently selected then we define the

280
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,269
the total action for that so it's it's

281
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,100
again really the same thing that I have

282
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,949
shown on the previous slide constructor

283
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,569
really empty because there is nothing to

284
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,209
initialize apart from the from the base

285
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,899
class that's at all so simple because

286
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,139
there are there are no cases when we

287
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,370
have to deal with reloading reloading

288
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,319
the model for example and then the init

289
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,279
function here you are going to create

290
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,160
context menu so first we grab the

291
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,870
selection tool because the selection

292
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,080
tool also offers the right-click context

293
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,089
menu that is displayed when you when you

294
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,940
right-click on something we create menu

295
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,970
the well the menu that we are going to

296
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:17,620
put our actions in and simply at the at

297
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,920
the entry they think with selection menu

298
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,050
because a feature allowing you to decide

299
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,940
when the one your menu is going to

300
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,339
appear so for that there are also

301
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,089
selection conditions so for example here

302
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,950
you can decide that the menu has to be

303
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,470
shown only when when you have selected

304
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,339
modules there are a few basic selection

305
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,959
conditions that you can join using and

306
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,240
or operators and that's about it that's

307
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,860
our that's our init method set

308
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,200
transitions very very short just run the

309
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,870
action fan-out method just run the

310
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,820
fan-out method when action fan-out

311
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,690
arrives and here is the most interesting

312
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,950
part we just get a few objects that you

313
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,660
are going to use when writing the tool

314
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,540
the selection tool sorry the section

315
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,770
itself from the selection tool the frame

316
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,649
the the window that that that is hosting

317
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,600
covered well the that the frame that is

318
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,829
displaying pcbnew the model design

319
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,360
settings because we want to know for

320
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,940
example what are the tracks envious

321
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,649
sizes that that are currently used in

322
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,350
the design and commit for storing our

323
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,640
changes now the first step that we need

324
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,589
that we need to do is to compute the

325
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,390
distance between vias well just

326
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,510
illustrate in we need to know what okay

327
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,230
we need to know what the distance

328
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,930
between one and its neighboring pad

329
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,319
and unfortunately in kicad they are not

330
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,920
sorted in in any other special way so in

331
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,199
order to find out what was the distance

332
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,439
you just need to pick the the first pad

333
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,250
and then iterate over the whole array

334
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,189
and just find out what is the shortest

335
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,280
distance and is going to be the this the

336
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:34,610
this segment this distance so here here

337
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,610
we take take the module from the module

338
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,440
we take the pad you obtain it we obtain

339
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,740
the position and the size of the module

340
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,679
and later is the the iteration loop that

341
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,090
I just described

342
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,000
we just get the position of every pad we

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,270
check the coordinates and then later we

344
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,309
compute the distance if it's smaller

345
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,110
than what we already computed and

346
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,520
probably this is the distance between

347
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,140
the two pods now when you have all the

348
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,790
information that we need for creating

349
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,830
the tracks and vias we can iterate again

350
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,720
over all pads that are starting the

351
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,770
module and here first we compute where

352
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,440
the wires should be placed later we

353
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,750
create a new track we set all properties

354
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,179
like layer where does it start where

355
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,650
does it end the net that it has assigned

356
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,050
with the taking advantage of the board

357
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,900
settings class

358
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,960
similar think similar thing applies for

359
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,200
the via it's very it's very similar and

360
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,140
both objects are later added to the

361
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,750
commit and this is the the part that is

362
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,140
done for for every pad this is the part

363
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,340
that is done for every part in the

364
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,309
module and when you have all tracks and

365
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,220
vias we just push it and it's done so

366
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,010
just to show just to show you how does

367
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,100
it work I have a very difficult version

368
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,110
so let's say you have a board like this

369
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,340
and there's a BGA that we want to route

370
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,910
so when you select it and and

371
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,390
right-click

372
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,760
there's the context menu that we have

373
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,960
created and the entry that is that is a

374
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,060
counterpart of the election that was

375
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,100
added in the CPP file and that's it it

376
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,970
just creates the the tracks and vias if

377
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,210
you want we can change the wire sizes

378
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,700
used for for the change the user change

379
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,520
the size of device that are created here

380
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,580
the track size and they are going to be

381
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:14,720
used here so that's about it and then

382
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,970
perhaps you will you would like to see

383
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,390
how our other tools implemented so if

384
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,670
you want a few simple examples I really

385
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,680
recommend you to look in the kicker

386
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,460
source code directory pcbnew tools and

387
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,810
there are free tools that are really

388
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,310
worth studying I think they are well

389
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,230
documented commented and they can

390
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,750
provide you examples that are worth

391
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,250
following ok now if you have created a

392
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,440
tool one thing is to check your code

393
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,330
formatting because usually does the does

394
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,360
the part when when there is something

395
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,230
wrong but certainly if it's only the

396
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,110
code formatting then then you don't

397
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,150
really to be worried too much just you

398
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,380
know you need to fix the in the

399
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,910
indentation because everyone knows that

400
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,840
tabs and spaces are important and then

401
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,210
if you have just a single patch you can

402
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,980
you can send it to the mail to the

403
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,560
developers mailing list or if it's a

404
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,660
bigger feature it's a it's a bigger

405
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,480
feature it's quite convenient to create

406
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,710
a merge request online but

407
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,260
now if you need some more information

408
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,760
there are a few links if I had to pick

409
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,380
only one I would go for the first one

410
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,930
you said dedicated page for developers

411
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,100
so there you can find the documentation

412
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,770
in the oxygen the the coding the code

413
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,530
formatting rules and all the information

414
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,870
that might be useful for you there's

415
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,300
also a tool frame or tutorial so it

416
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,490
basically explains the concepts that I

417
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,550
told you about today and if you prefer

418
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,290
human interaction there is also the

419
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,510
quite active developer mailing list and

420
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,840
then IRC channel on freenode net the

421
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,340
developers are spread around the world

422
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,190
so you can find someone in every time

423
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,210
zone at every time of day and I hope

424
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,800
it's much clearer right now

425
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,870
and if it's not it's the time to ask

426
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:38,760
questions the question was to say a bit

427
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,790
more about the plugin plugin system do

428
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:50,130
you mean the tool framework well here

429
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,960
there's the there's the interface that

430
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,400
well you can interact with the board I

431
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,170
mean for the tools it's not like you

432
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,150
have a shared library that is compiled

433
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,850
somewhere somewhere outside of the tree

434
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,000
so all the tools are compiled and linked

435
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,030
ethically with kicad so it's not it's

436
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,899
not a plug-in per se

437
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,480
if his plug-ins for for schematics for

438
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,650
schematic formats as I mentioned and for

439
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,770
board board format so it's so it's just

440
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:45,330
saving and loading files well for the

441
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,460
tools for the tools they're not real

442
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,910
talk is for for 3d models for board

443
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,510
files and schematics that they are oh

444
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,420
sorry I think for freedom of those they

445
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,060
can be plugins and for everything else

446
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:14,430
there is just the interface know about

447
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,610
this the question is is the process the

448
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,800
same for the interactive tools and and

449
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,320
the and the example that I have shown

450
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,280
right so well basically yes the only

451
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,780
difference is how you write the event

452
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,150
handler because you can have a while

453
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,460
keep receiving keep receiving events and

454
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,430
then you can react to them okay but if

455
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,530
you modify the object and and use the

456
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,930
board commit it will be it will be done

457
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,990
for you but during editing I have to

458
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,520
paint myself no no if you modify it and

459
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,350
use birth commit is done

460
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,280
you
