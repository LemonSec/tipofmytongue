1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,410
so welcome to the class of 2017

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,840
distributions Deborah I am here with an

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,200
Nikola and Samuel krischell and they are

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,540
talk to us today about Maggio successes

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,520
and lessons learned after six years of

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,680
for people or six years after whole

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,750
thank you okay

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,039
can you hear me can you hear me okay so

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:38,890
so I have to speak okay so I'm the girl

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,710
yeah I'm here for the quarter and so we

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,080
are going to speak about magia who knows

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,839
about magia here except the usual

13
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:54,120
suspects okay thank you

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,089
so we wanted to to propose a talk about

15
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:00,489
what we have done in Murcia and how it

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,560
caused since we started in six years ago

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,369
in fact so a brief presentation of medea

18
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,799
for those who knows who don't know about

19
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,490
it so magia is a fork from Man River in

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,789
2010 when things went bad in Monterrey

21
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,270
and we didn't want to lose ten years of

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,950
work and code so as most of the salaries

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,649
we are leaving the companies we decided

24
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,399
then to just save the code and create

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,939
this book it was decision in about five

26
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,509
minutes

27
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:48,039
and when we are a bit mad but after all

28
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,310
it was a good decision

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,270
so what we wanted to preserve is the

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,290
free software basis and the way how it's

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,830
easy to use for those contributors and

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,920
users because we you will see that it's

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,649
a big goal for us to make it easy for

34
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,720
people to contribute to magia also we

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
had a big challenge as the distribution

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,780
was based on a company before and we

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,520
have to switch to a community which is

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,660
also a big thing to achieve both legal

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,670
financial organization and so on just to

40
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,870
give you an idea about Mozilla community

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,050
we have about 100 packages accounts they

42
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,230
are not all active a lot but still they

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,220
are working on modular we do have 3030

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,870
accounts also it's not all active but it

45
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,170
shows quite an activity on on bad

46
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,550
management and we achieve more than 20

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:11,910
thousand bucks just some days ago we do

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,610
have some mailing list also for example

49
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,860
one dedicated to development with two

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,380
thousand and fifty people registered

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,200
general descriptions and also quite

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,340
active forums for reservoir users and a

53
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,100
lot of discussion there and seen some

54
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,320
issues to make those people spoke to

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,690
gate speak together they've both on on

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,549
one side developer and in the other side

57
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:42,860
users well what we wanted to do was to

58
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,090
especially give back the control to the

59
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,810
community because mantri that was part

60
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,200
of the distribution before and we had to

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,180
to make an all community project

62
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,510
we had to set up all the things to make

63
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,989
it work and it took a long time at the

64
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,939
beginning it took about nearly four

65
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,480
months four months especially for the

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,139
other infrastructure tools because we

67
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,130
had we had no no specific idea how to

68
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,940
handle it at the beginning so it it must

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,080
be reliable maintainable scalable and so

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,300
people started to work on something we

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,940
didn't have in Moon River like config

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,610
management tools like perpetuate weenies

73
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,530
threat order in the infrastructure and

74
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,860
also find the resources like the servers

75
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,130
the money - - - for the bandwidth and

76
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,280
and so on so the first the first version

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,360
of the distribution was not a big a big

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,840
a big one it was just to start from

79
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,660
Monrovia and then go to magia so the

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,720
first big work was to bootstrap the

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,639
distribution don't know if you know

82
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,190
about it we have a blog a blog post

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,500
about it it's just to reveal all the

84
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,590
distribution from the very basis so that

85
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,250
we have all from magia and we are sure

86
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,930
that we have everything we need

87
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,389
as packages and codes to rebuild the

88
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,639
distribution and when we start it we

89
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,729
didn't have any goal just to save the

90
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,000
code that was the only goal we had and

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,919
finally the goal just went after

92
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,640
so this is how we are organized we want

93
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,940
it to something clear and easy to

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,780
understand for new comer so this is the

95
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,280
team we we communicate so we have in

96
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,370
fact to two big structures you have the

97
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,980
magic council and the board the board is

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,690
reserved for all the legal expect

99
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,150
respect for the maggia Association it's

100
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:17,420
based in France and really it's not

101
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,040
merely nothing happened in the boat

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,860
because it's just to manage the this

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,040
legal aspect everything happened in the

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,800
maggia community comes in this is a

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,020
place where all the teens in a

106
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,700
distribution have some represent

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,210
represent ins and we have description

108
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,660
between the teams between packages

109
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,370
documentation communication and so on

110
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,510
and we try to to find solution there we

111
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,020
have regular meetings during release we

112
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,960
do have one within one meeting per which

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,500
on IRC otherwise it's every two or three

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,710
weeks for now for six years we had to to

115
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,720
report some problems maybe one or twice

116
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,350
to the board only so so this is working

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,260
quite well for now and all the things

118
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,930
then have specific goals

119
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,910
so as I said package shows documentation

120
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,669
development security and so on and they

121
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,710
are all organized as they want they are

122
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,530
quite autonomous we try not to be too

123
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,890
heavy and just ask them to report to the

124
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,570
council so that we can have a global

125
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,250
view of what is happening in the

126
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,540
distribution and so people so now as you

127
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,110
will see we try to lower the barriers to

128
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,990
entry those teams so that everybody can

129
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,130
contribute among G in media

130
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,330
so yeah article create auto

131
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,830
congratulation slides we are happy for

132
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,080
now because if you follow a bit Maria we

133
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,760
have now five releases out so this is

134
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,640
quite nice because fork is always a big

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,070
question is it going to work it is going

136
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,660
to in the time and well we have five

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,830
distribution out the six in down the way

138
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,000
it's it's taking time but it's going and

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,250
we do have now a real community of users

140
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,760
and contributors that was a big fact are

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,950
we going to chip our contributors and

142
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,130
it's it's working at other moments what

143
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,530
we are proud of is we didn't have nasty

144
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,610
issues on this five releases means no

145
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,729
big headline with high magia broke

146
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,040
everything and and so on so a bride is

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
going smoothly and new version are going

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,870
smoothly also and well the only thing

149
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,610
which has changed at the beginning

150
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,160
wanted to communicate on planning say

151
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,830
the next version is planned for this

152
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,100
date and and things like that and we are

153
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,160
taking the I could say the Debian way of

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,950
releasing that's a big one we will eat

155
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,620
when it's ready because of the

156
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,410
constraint of the community everybody is

157
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,290
not available at the same time we had to

158
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,900
make some choice and decide to test to

159
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,790
lower the the headlines

160
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:43,100
hi so she's the among s - the one who's

161
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,709
coming from the company before and now

162
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,620
doing it all on her free time and I'm I

163
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,959
started like like many contributors as a

164
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,680
user who started reporting bugs and and

165
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,199
progressively get into the distribution

166
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:05,800
and and contributed so I talked about

167
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:09,439
contribution so some facts obvious facts

168
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:12,139
a healthy community project needs

169
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,839
through an you its contributors wise or

170
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,139
group even if possible grow it in order

171
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,069
to do better thing so we need to attract

172
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,149
potential contributors and most of all

173
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,999
have them stay so how it works in

174
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:35,620
messiah it's that our team are welcoming

175
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,050
that's not just a word it's the way it

176
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,290
works maybe in somethings better than in

177
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,490
other things but globally that good

178
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,600
relationship between people be then all

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,579
contributors are new contributors and

180
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,550
and we have a special attention to

181
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,980
newcomers because we know it's not easy

182
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,999
to go somewhere you don't know that you

183
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,379
don't know people you don't know how to

184
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,929
contribute we tend to we try to make it

185
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:10,550
easy so in messiah it's not just for

186
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,679
elite joining the teams it's is for

187
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,699
anyone with strong motivation and of

188
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:18,860
course being able to work together with

189
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,550
teams with other people and we have a

190
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,699
mentoring program to help them start in

191
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:29,870
good conditions and learn how we work

192
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,309
together the barrier to contributing is

193
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,699
usually higher in users heads than it is

194
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,440
in reality because the

195
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
common belief that you need

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,550
extraordinary skills to contribute to

197
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,370
such a big project and some users have a

198
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,700
habit of thinking that they are outside

199
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,910
and that maybe some remaining client

200
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,360
mentality's that the providers that

201
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,870
users the consumers so we have to

202
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,540
communicate and invite them so I try to

203
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,690
illustrate that with extraordinary

204
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,470
schematics so on the Left that's what's

205
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,050
in many users heads not every one of

206
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,020
them of course so you have the

207
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,880
contributors and that's what they will

208
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,030
call Maria and you have the users and

209
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,510
that's not Maria and the contributors

210
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,120
that deliver the product and users they

211
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,920
use it and they ask when they have

212
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,880
problems or need something and there's a

213
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,900
distance between them and I think it's a

214
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,920
big distance what it's actually it's

215
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,420
that in by definition Maria is the

216
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,090
community of all users contributors all

217
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,270
together because just using the product

218
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,390
just using Maria is already contributing

219
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,270
it's enlarging our user base and it

220
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,000
always brings some kind of benefits to

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,250
the distribution in the end maybe

222
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,320
someone will see what you are using and

223
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,200
get interesting to it maybe you will be

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,410
so angry at a given bug that you will

225
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,750
take the steps to repel rip out the

226
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,520
baguette so you are already contributing

227
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,710
and the stats to go to a next level of

228
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:27,890
contribution if you wish quite low it's

229
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,740
quite easy to small yes small

230
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,070
so now I could talk a lot about

231
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,029
contribution but we focus on a specific

232
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,480
part of contribution that it's that is

233
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,450
important in any project but in

234
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,980
community in community distribution it's

235
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,920
a real question it's about leadership so

236
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,399
we have lots of different projects lots

237
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,290
of different teams in the distribution

238
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,510
lots of lots of people we need some kind

239
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,899
of coordination so we need some kind of

240
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,329
leadership to some people to show the

241
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,899
way and to act as catalysts to for more

242
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,610
more guided work so we have elected team

243
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,000
leaders in some teams it's not just one

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,880
it's several corridors who work together

245
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,440
and there are also deputies and almost I

246
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,089
looked at our current teens and

247
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,790
currently almost all of them just

248
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,100
started as users and when progressively

249
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,190
into teams and

250
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,730
became team leaders and not every team

251
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,149
leader dreamt of being a team leader

252
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,630
sometimes it and maybe often it's no one

253
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,320
else wants to have this burden on their

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,370
shoulder and someone says ok I'll do it

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,589
of leadership that is with less

256
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,870
responsibilities but with a great impact

257
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,269
if if done it's helping other people to

258
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,449
work together towards some goal and I

259
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,529
will take an example lots of text that's

260
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,540
if you don't understand you can't

261
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,300
understand me you have part of it but I

262
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,279
try to to be clear so we have this

263
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,459
annoying

264
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,820
Rudi's blocker bug it's been there for a

265
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,850
month and it's in my it was in module

266
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,020
six and the process was ok it had been

267
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,420
created correctly assigned to the right

268
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,370
person of a group of persons but

269
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,660
thing happen so you are annoyed by the

270
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,630
bag and you decide that you will try to

271
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,029
have it fixed you don't know how you

272
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,880
don't know who will manage to fix it but

273
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,730
you try and first you say is there is

274
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,310
there is this bag is someone working on

275
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,480
it can someone work on it you can't give

276
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,710
orders and it doesn't work at first

277
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,800
probably everyone is too busy or things

278
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,190
it's someone else's job someone else had

279
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,589
the skills to do it

280
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:29,660
so you ask you again still no success so

281
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,550
finally you try your relation and you

282
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,279
you ask to someone specifically you know

283
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
that might be the right person and he

284
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,790
says okay so that's help but in some

285
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,250
situations this stops here actually and

286
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,029
the bug is fixed and everybody is happy

287
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,920
but in this slide since I want you to be

288
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,790
really a lot of text and continuing so

289
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,599
several weeks a month again or later you

290
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,319
notice that it's still not solved so you

291
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,540
decide to act again that's that's the

292
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,770
act of leadership you do you decide

293
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,359
right you're not a team you know you're

294
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,309
just someone who wants things you will

295
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:25,220
move forward so you ask about the stages

296
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,010
but the first volunteer finally won't be

297
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,470
able to make it in time or maybe won't

298
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,610
answer at all so you're back to square

299
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,050
one no one wants to take responsibility

300
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,270
alone for this difficult task so you try

301
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,330
something else you asked several people

302
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,950
who are annoyed by the bug also let's

303
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,050
fix it together and you form a commando

304
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,500
and we work off list with them exchange

305
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,390
information about it and you focus

306
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,550
during your small app of time

307
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,280
on this perky and finally it works

308
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,980
someone gives an element of the

309
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,110
beginning someone else knows something

310
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,070
about how system D works and will tell

311
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,380
you a possible thing to try and one week

312
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,020
later it's fixed so that's an example

313
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,210
that shows that there's a formal

314
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,590
contribution that is not easily

315
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,970
described in dreams or in batch of teams

316
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,820
of Canada's contribution but is also

317
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,840
really important to make to remove the

318
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,050
the blocking points in it doesn't

319
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,360
require extraordinary skills just

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,960
communication and commitment you have to

321
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,070
do want it to be fixed okay yeah that

322
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,990
was a longer slide I know now we'll talk

323
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,050
about our QA and security teams so both

324
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,520
used to be inside the company before

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,670
before so we had a concern because we

326
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,190
didn't know if he would find volunteers

327
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,220
but we could not just take the former

328
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,550
contributors and transport them into the

329
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,370
community because there were no former

330
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,340
contributors so we had to read something

331
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,260
from scratch it worked the QA team who

332
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,780
tests the updates candidates and also

333
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,170
the ISO image ISO images because before

334
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,310
they are ready well we were ready to

335
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,160
find a great team leader who shape the

336
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,330
team with great communication and this

337
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,370
team now and for years has had weekly

338
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,580
meetings on IRC and it has then feel

339
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,740
like through that shot but it with

340
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,490
anything it's a real team and and also

341
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,610
that team leader had to stop recently

342
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,360
the team is strong enough to continue

343
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,620
they have an efficient monitoring

344
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,830
program it's the team where we send new

345
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,620
contributors when they don't know what

346
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,120
to what to work on

347
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,630
tell them try the q18 and it can be a

348
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,120
step towards packaging our other

349
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,230
contribution forms - okay and they have

350
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,330
their own tools so that it's easier to

351
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,510
contribute so it's really effective now

352
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,830
and the security team it's one person so

353
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,190
that's one extremely dedicated person

354
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,000
who watches and creates bug reports for

355
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,020
every security issue and tries to get

356
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,280
other packages to work on it but and

357
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,090
doing most of the work himself

358
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,000
surprisingly even this way we are often

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,270
as fast as other distros who have more

360
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,790
resources and we have a high confidence

361
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,420
in these updates thanks to the QA

362
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,410
testing so it works so far but it's not

363
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,929
sustainable in the long term but let's

364
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,940
hope the new package joins the security

365
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:24,280
team what's now like we are not going to

366
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,090
switch to hard but we have many goals

367
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,309
still to achieve and I will talk about

368
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:39,400
it on the tool side it's not to speak

369
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,900
about tools because there are tools but

370
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,920
they can help on achieving these goals

371
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,670
so we try to start very simple very easy

372
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,790
and give the tools to work to our

373
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,480
contributors but that was six years ago

374
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,040
now a long time we do have now resources

375
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,429
this is real we are reliable sorry even

376
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,380
more than in mantra because when I was

377
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,120
working in mantra we did have some more

378
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,520
crashes like in than in in magia and we

379
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,100
do have also a small motivated team and

380
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,820
see that mean tools and there they are

381
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,040
very high level skill so that's a good

382
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,030
thing but

383
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,690
this is far from being perfect why

384
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,520
because we do have we still have some

385
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,700
oldest side in our infrastructure

386
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,140
especially for example we still have

387
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,850
some SVN use we have packages in the SVN

388
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,160
and all the card is in get so we still

389
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,020
have to migrate all the things to get

390
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,880
this is a big goal to achieve also we do

391
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,870
have to adapt the tool we have the more

392
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,540
the the the most user-friendly tool we

393
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,170
have for now is get wet but that's not

394
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,620
not too bad but we do have to think

395
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,990
about having new tools like you know

396
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,060
like it lab for example to help people

397
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,380
contributing also we have a big

398
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,350
bottleneck in season it in season admin

399
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,680
tool team sorry because for now either

400
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,750
you have all the rights on all the

401
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,940
infrastructure or you have no right

402
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,720
there is no granular right so it's hard

403
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,370
to integrate the team because you need

404
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,030
to trust them a lot because you are just

405
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,340
giving the root password in fact so

406
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,330
that's a big also that that's a big

407
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,080
evolution to make and also we we do have

408
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,520
also a point with the patches management

409
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,620
tool so for now if you want to

410
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,570
contribute and just an attach to start

411
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,030
with you have to use either the mailing

412
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,260
list or on IRC and the bestest bacteria

413
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,330
but it must be love because there is a

414
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,180
it's a hard things in each time so we do

415
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,420
have also to find a way to to to help

416
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,700
people to bring some patches as a first

417
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,790
contribution so what we have as goal is

418
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,480
using today tools no other choice and as

419
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,460
I talk we are thinking about

420
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,580
introducing gait lab just to enforce our

421
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,440
workflow and help people like with

422
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,149
review tools for example much review

423
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:32,499
tools inside and give some more easier

424
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:35,799
access to the code and to the packages

425
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,159
this is a big thing to do

426
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,559
also we do have a lot of tools upstream

427
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,460
tools from Atia

428
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,799
like building the ISOs or the drastic

429
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,059
stores and so on and we do need to give

430
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,249
some visibility to this project so give

431
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,919
life will be a way to help us to

432
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,559
advertise and take some more contributor

433
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,149
on it and finally yes we have to also

434
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,809
help people to rethink the workflow we

435
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,499
use gates but we use it as SVN so no

436
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:10,809
branches so it's hard to collaborate

437
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,690
because everything basically is in

438
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,999
master so if you want to contribute you

439
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,369
have to you have to plate branch which

440
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,470
are not used for now so it's very hard

441
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,809
to to manage so at least well if you if

442
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,559
you if you want to speak with us just we

443
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,960
need some some feedback we have some

444
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,119
questions see here which are still

445
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,200
handling we we have some question about

446
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,090
package shows organization maybe there

447
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,070
are some distribution guys here in the

448
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,009
room how to get people interesting back

449
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,499
fixing that the big question and how to

450
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:49,419
get some contribution in non-technical

451
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,029
areas that is also a big point for

452
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,259
margin Thanks

453
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,629
you
