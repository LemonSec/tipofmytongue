1
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,980
and software as a service by zine

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,689
because processing happens on the server

3
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,730
side in the cloud is - and there this

4
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,009
model in many cases is based on new

5
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,280
Tizen personal data through targeted

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,059
advertising means data is is not in our

7
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,750
hands anymore it is coupled on to

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,290
servers so by the way and and will reuse

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,199
your catch phrases you've probably fear

10
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,710
with there is no cloud the cloud is

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,260
someone else computer that's that's a

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,989
very nice way to introduce the cloud to

13
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,510
no ordinary people with thing the cloud

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,729
is something magical though the cloud is

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,900
just someone else's computer and in the

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,280
cloud data is centralized there's no

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,619
freedom for users to have any you know

18
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:16,340
impact on the data because well maybe

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,110
there are some free and open source

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,430
software on the servers like the curl

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,350
and a few things but really the

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,020
application itself is not free software

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,060
and so the user hasn't control over the

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,979
education and therefore has a control of

25
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,190
Y being what is being done with his or

26
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,220
her data so you're probably all familiar

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,820
with the fate of our Edward Snowden that

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,700
was lower which basically no has

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,850
released a lot of information he's had a

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,799
lot of information from his employer at

31
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,450
the sa-2 journalist and and what really

32
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,670
boils down to is data centralization

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,519
makes mass surveillance economically

34
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,879
possible basically the NSA and and

35
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,659
deverel other government agencies want

36
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,849
to listen to everyone they want to

37
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,030
record every conversation whether it

38
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,290
happen on the phone or on a computer and

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,940
they do that because it's their mission

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,890
and because it's too expensive

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,350
to do surveillance to seven billion

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,720
people on earth right now it's a lot

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,360
cheaper sin go and fetch the data from

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,270
the very companies that concentrate our

45
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,920
data into a few silos and this is an

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,340
issue as it explains here this is grain

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,290
bill wool was which is one of the two

48
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,270
journalists that met with Edward Snowden

49
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,140
first it's basically if you are under

50
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,480
surveillance you do self-censorship mass

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,280
surveilling em here mass surveillance

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,910
creates a prison in the mod if you are

53
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,100
under surveillance you change your

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,459
behavior and this is not just no

55
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,110
something we think it's it's

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,850
scientifically proven we do self sensor

57
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,590
and here's the here's the the proof so

58
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,690
wikipedia has a lot of pages and it's

59
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,150
it's totally okay to be visiting

60
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,790
wikipedia pages you know it's it's legal

61
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,489
to visit would if you get pages I mean

62
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,209
right we we agree on that but there are

63
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,769
some pages we discuss which discuss

64
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:54,079
topics that are today all touchy Islam

65
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:01,700
or jihad or you know terrorism are such

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,590
topics and pages that people may you

67
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,930
know they hear a lot about this in the

68
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,060
media and it's really good that as

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,400
citizens they won't know more go to

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,860
Wikipedia to learn more about these

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,890
topics but at the same time if you look

72
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,880
at the jihad page maybe you could think

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,680
I couldn't into trouble because we'll

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,500
think you know someone they could think

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,260
I am doing it for the wrong reasons

76
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,650
and so what you see here is basically

77
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,550
the mean audience of the these search

78
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,240
pages with touchy subjects only on the

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,220
US version of Wikipedia

80
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,510
and so as you see the trend is

81
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,940
increasing really fast and then here

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,850
that that mark is snowed the first

83
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,940
Snowden revelations we're learned that

84
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,390
surveillance mass surveillance was

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,060
happening and people knew they were

86
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,150
under surveillance probably not for sure

87
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,670
but there were programs and surveillance

88
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,710
and as you can see the trend here

89
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,510
suddenly there is a sudden drop and

90
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,470
visiting these pages which once again it

91
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,590
is legal to view and read these pages it

92
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,440
is a good thing but as we know as we are

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,600
under surveillance we change our

94
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,960
behavior in many cases we don't know we

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,960
change our behavior but we do not dare

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,870
visiting Wikipedia anymore but as we

97
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,480
could you know catch a bullet for being

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,930
around so this is this is a real example

99
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,220
significant our behavior when we are

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,340
under servings and this is why it's such

101
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,729
a big issue with with mass surveillance

102
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,760
you have heard I'm sure Larry Lessig

103
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,540
which said basically caught is low if in

104
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,850
the digital age the people will write

105
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,060
the software the people who decide what

106
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,980
the people what other people can do

107
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,530
because you know software is all

108
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,290
everywhere in our lives and and so well

109
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,260
we we as software developers decide what

110
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,810
other people do and this is exactly why

111
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,600
if we have free software we can have a

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,590
free society and there's a another thing

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,919
which is really nice that if code is law

114
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,730
and I think it is then architecture is

115
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,510
politics the way we architecture

116
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,810
software and stuff is is we would decide

117
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,340
how things are gonna work

118
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,470
so it's to us hackers

119
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,560
I mean that force in a good way till the

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,350
Internet we want the Internet's that we

121
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,450
want and the internet that it ended

122
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:14,960
dozen down to us so here a larger viewer

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,110
a picture we have to build a new one we

124
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,710
need to buy the new Agnew whatever

125
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,780
decentralized internet instead of

126
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,820
centralized intent owned by a handful of

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,280
operations we need all kinds of free and

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,040
open source decentralized efforts build

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,570
that internet start with a personal town

130
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,360
solution which is I'm working on cozy

131
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,520
but there are other solutions why you

132
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,010
know hoes sandstorm or clown annexed

133
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,960
cloud are examples of such open source

134
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,610
and free software solution to give back

135
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,950
control of the insight to the users but

136
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,040
there are all sorts of projects here

137
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,190
today that are going to be presented in

138
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,590
this room there are so many and so

139
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,480
diverse I could not come up with proper

140
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,850
categories to explain there are you know

141
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,880
people who do service hosting like

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,380
shuttle one and fama so there are you

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,880
know of course software they're a

144
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,169
do-it-yourself ISPs Wi-Fi for structure

145
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,150
based on free software and all that kind

146
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,270
of thing so there are many things and

147
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,730
this is what is going to cool today as

148
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,159
we are going to discover all of these

149
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,220
new approaches to build a decentralized

150
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,560
internet with the hope of making this a

151
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,980
movement just a bunch not just a bunch

152
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,620
of projects but really people working

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,750
together and that was the goal of these

154
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,360
day today is to get people together and

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,640
connect them so that we build teller a

156
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,050
decentralization thank you

157
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:14,600
I see that we all would have a question

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:25,730
here ludo two missions the internet made

159
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,589
of cables connecting data centers to

160
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,929
others so in the data centers we can

161
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,549
have all the solutions we want but like

162
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:34,009
the cables thrown by nutrition do you

163
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,299
know of any efforts of I mean cables

164
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,220
owned by the people not owned by orange

165
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,559
Pocky be like efforts to knife through

166
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,920
the cable between the US or well we like

167
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,269
more European century cable between say

168
00:09:52,269 --> 00:10:00,649
Europe mainland and UK I need to repeat

169
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,850
the questions keep your questions short

170
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,239
because there you're not heard on video

171
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:08,329
and so whatever the cables that make the

172
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,970
internet they the fickle Internet they

173
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,350
do matter they need to exist and I think

174
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,410
the issue is more like on the last mile

175
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,049
or a few last miles and this is why they

176
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:23,779
do it yourself IPS are really

177
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,009
interesting the the actual cables the

178
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,110
big cable xeno optical cables under the

179
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,220
sea and stuff I got

180
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,499
we are totally not there yet but if we

181
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:40,850
do have encryption enable I think this

182
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,980
solves a lot of the issues connected

183
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,720
with that it's not solving all of them

184
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,970
but if it's encrypted they are not going

185
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,919
to be you know doing internet neutrality

186
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,689
stuff against internet ID and stuff like

187
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,350
that so I think we're pretty say there

188
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,759
doesn't mean we don't have to try but I

189
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,360
think there are more urgent matters that

190
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,919
are mostly related in my opinion to

191
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,809
devices and servers and such the good

192
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,029
news is that we have raspberry PI's that

193
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,360
for basically 50 euros you can build a

194
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,819
decent sort now the question is is it

195
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,100
going to be safe and secure and easy to

196
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,680
administer

197
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,569
that's that's the question we need to

198
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:25,230
solve but at least the whole we're here

199
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,079
is easier in extremely promising is

200
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,639
there I'll take your laughter keep it

201
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,839
short because I have to repeat it

202
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:54,360
yes and so what's your pian sir its

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:10,740
encryption the solution no I I agree

204
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,490
it's not there it's dangerous everywhere

205
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,420
I mean the internet for the people is

206
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,550
under attack prema on every front

207
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,410
so encrypt banning encryption is a major

208
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,629
issue and it's a political one and need

209
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,230
to fight in favor of encryption pretty

210
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,569
much everywhere we go I'm it's gonna be

211
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,749
hard for me to fight for the Chinese but

212
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:40,439
I can fight in here and I do fight in

213
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,499
France where it's my country and

214
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,009
everywhere here

215
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,529
so yes the encryption right to

216
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,660
encryption is something we need to fight

217
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,259
for absolutely is there another question

218
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,330
so we're the idea of building a

219
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,090
decentralized internet from right that's

220
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,800
if I understand your question well I

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
I wasn't like I said with Mozilla for 17

222
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,480
years and 20 years ago I was at foes dam

223
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,130
which if I remember quickly was old owes

224
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,650
them at the park at the time not not

225
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,360
frozen air because the free part was

226
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,510
only open source natori and richest old

227
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,780
man came and yelled in well of course

228
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,660
and and so it changed was the works

229
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,730
there so yelling worse and and and I was

230
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,170
with a colleague and we had the first

231
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,710
[Music]

232
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,670
mozilla dev room and in after 17 years i

233
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,710
was like now the issue is not so much on

234
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,510
the client side it's also on the server

235
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,990
side this is why I've joined kuzey to

236
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,510
create that and of course I ended up

237
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,620
knowing a lot of people in in Sim things

238
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,920
and and and Julia see then and and I'm

239
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,440
together came and well we know people

240
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,510
that are interested in you know somebody

241
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,750
which is pretty similar tested and is

242
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,250
involved in a DIY ISP bomb is involved

243
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,760
in and why you know host and together

244
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,410
well connect with our projects and we

245
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,930
say yeah let's let's request a room a

246
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,880
dev room and at first them like I did in

247
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,910
Mozilla like 17 years ago and it

248
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,160
happened thank you for them and I hope

249
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,750
says that the first one the next one

250
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,850
there's going to be a lot bigger and

251
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,910
bigger and if you see you know the first

252
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,410
Mozilla at that room was like pretty

253
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,130
much this size and now it's really huge

254
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,339
so so this is this may be this history

255
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,400
you know you will be able to say to your

256
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,810
 alone I was there

257
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,790
[Laughter]

258
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:57,110
trade trade so yeah your question week

259
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,190
is how is is there a chance that we win

260
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,529
with the centralized approach as opposed

261
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,150
to centralized first I think the

262
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,520
Internet is inherently decentralized

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,950
that's one thing it was built to be

264
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,779
surprised a second there are things that

265
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,810
are working for us the smartphone

266
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,690
industry is building power efficient and

267
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,130
powerful chips that are very very

268
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,940
inexpensive think if you if they're the

269
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,130
new tripled a new board called the

270
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,320
orange pie zero which is seven euros and

271
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,760
it's squat core 1 2 gigahertz you know

272
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,140
it really is something so even the

273
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,120
rabbit pie which is inexpensive it's

274
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,850
just the beginning and it thanks to this

275
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,920
learning industry with that staking our

276
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,420
idea

277
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,160
we're actually it's impairing us with

278
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,369
new hardware which is very different so

279
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,540
it doesn't have to be fully

280
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,260
decentralized and there's my personal

281
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,349
opinion I'm a pragmatic pragmatist and I

282
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,829
think that if we start a halfway decent

283
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,939
Erised

284
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,959
and we do surprise

285
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,599
not well we decentralize halfway and

286
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,850
have like I don't know

287
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,870
regional servers it's a lot better than

288
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,710
hanging a worldwide server so we could

289
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,080
use we could leverage the efficiency of

290
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,890
data centers but have more control over

291
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,160
that and just something we're going to

292
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,809
see with the D Google lies your life and

293
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,360
their their approach with FRA myself you

294
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,790
you will see it's very yeah and you read

295
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,550
French do you I encourage you to read a

296
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,620
book because that's what I explained on

297
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:30,140
300 pages basically yes it's it's so I

298
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,960
repeat question is it going to work with

299
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,050
email the email question because of spam

300
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,790
and protection against spam is really

301
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,080
hard but who owns a gmail account here

302
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
in this room raise your hand okay now

303
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,240
this is the problem if you if you

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,720
started removing your email from Google

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,000
to an your ISPs email that would be a

306
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,500
lot of progress not the perfect solution

307
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,250
but progress and you know in really

308
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,090
centralizing the email so yes we can

309
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,790
start with that and and and the world's

310
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,480
can page but giving up you know just buy

311
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,320
your own domain

312
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,690
and use the email servers of your hoster

313
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,850
that's already yet start and these

314
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,190
people know how to run a mail server

315
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,200
that is recognized by Gmail so

316
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,309
[Music]

317
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,760
so what about ordinary users for having

318
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,620
a decentralized internet yeah so if I

319
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,200
may and we have like two more minutes

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,360
I'll give you a very quick example where

321
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,990
we do at Cosi which basically enables

322
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,799
you to connect your data from all your

323
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,929
devices and with connectors or all your

324
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,580
services

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,490
on your personal cloud and this personal

326
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,140
cloud you know it's like personal or

327
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,120
like this Matt phone is personal no user

328
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,820
name it's you just enter the password it

329
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,179
entered and you have access and you it's

330
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,380
just like a smartphone you know you

331
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,870
become buttons they have calendar

332
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,630
contacts and found photos you can import

333
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,440
your data for Google can add connectors

334
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,390
and applications you see your files you

335
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,280
see your contacts and such your calendar

336
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
all of that works and it runs not

337
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,630
necessarily at home it can run on a on

338
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,960
the server that you pay for and so there

339
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,909
is no incentive for the the hosting

340
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,270
company you pay to data on your data

341
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,640
because they already make good money by

342
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
renting you server space so that's

343
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,809
that's what we want to do I'm not saying

344
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,610
it's perfect but it's a good media term

345
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,500
solution it's easy to use and you don't

346
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,090
have to worry about the security because

347
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,610
you have you know professionals that's

348
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,630
managed to manage your server that's I

349
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,370
think we will need to prepare for the

350
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,919
next one you don't have a one last quick

351
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:31,200
question before anybody at some point

352
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,779
I think Snowden attending pack because

353
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,460
it made the front page of the media

354
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,320
that's pretty much it

355
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,139
I think it was better than that but it's

356
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,359
re pretty good

357
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,700
Amy's up we need to prepare for the next

358
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,780
talk thank you very much

359
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:59,910
[Applause]
