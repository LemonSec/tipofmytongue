1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,490
we're closing this now that they were

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,260
frustrated which I understand very much

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,820
and I mean so they think that you know

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,980
we're gonna be living as scavengers of

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,500
whatever hardware platforms others have

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,480
and try find the one that we can somehow

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,110
make use off still and we're gonna you

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,299
know somehow try to work around biggest

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,989
problems there's attempts to somehow you

10
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,530
know get um like you know the management

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,840
engine ripped out or you know flash it

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,879
was something that you know exited

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,519
actually no longer functional there's a

14
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,290
chance to somehow you know find ways to

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,210
make that hardware support what we need

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,580
and guys from wrap to engineering or

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,909
understandably I think frustrated about

18
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,519
that when you have such a better choice

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,820
plus it's not where they three should be

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,030
going and I agree because I don't want

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,899
to be a second-class citizen in a

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,760
forgive me but this one is I cannot

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,550
leave in a u.s. culture dominated world

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,360
I don't think second-class citizen is

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,100
very good status to have in that kind of

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,670
world I think we want an actual world

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,000
where we can get to build things that

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,290
are ahead of the state-of-the-art that

29
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,610
also reflects our value in other words I

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,409
mean usually CEOs tell their staff don't

31
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,610
build stargates in this case I think

32
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,850
should build one I think we should aim

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,030
high I do believe that we as a community

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,050
should understand that there is

35
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,110
currently a turning point when power can

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,100
succeed and it does on some fields high

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,570
performance computing scientific

38
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,860
computing it's actually very successful

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,090
there it can till drift off in areas

40
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,480
that are useless to us it could still

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,030
fail of course although I by this point

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,530
in time the critical mass seems to be

43
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,720
there but the point is will it be our

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,390
ally will it be our platform of the

45
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,049
future and that is something that we get

46
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,739
to determine right I believe that as of

47
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,870
right now all power is our last hope for

48
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,170
an actual strong hot rod form

49
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,990
that we can determine that we can

50
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,590
influence that we can shape and build

51
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,190
and disassemble and rebuild and keep

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,550
doing the things with it we want to do

53
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,620
so here's what I want you to do all

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,060
right I did this with a different font

55
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,120
now this broke um doesn't matter so I

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,370
want you get involved in the whole band

57
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,280
power thing I want you to think about

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,930
that platform when build your software

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,870
in fact I want you to play with it as

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,120
fun with your software there's actual

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,910
programs from IBM which is currently

62
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,250
producing on the chips or mass that you

63
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,040
can actually get access to hardware for

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,830
free soft projects at much much better

65
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,830
conditions if you're interested in that

66
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,200
and I will gladly oq up with the right

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,420
people and make sure that somehow we get

68
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,030
your boxes because I think we should get

69
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,050
involved in this I do want you to help

70
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,670
spread board I mean most in our

71
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,590
community that I've spoken to for the

72
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,530
past year all of this had never heard of

73
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,300
this had ever thought about this and had

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,269
never actually come across this before

75
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,190
they didn't even know it existed for

76
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,900
some reason IBM tries to communicate

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,080
something it ends up being a really well

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,570
kept secret they are horrible at

79
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,910
communication we need to grab this and

80
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,930
make it ours in fact that's what we

81
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,820
started doing I mean we did an event

82
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,950
who's with IBM and read together last

83
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,900
year to go the first actual

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,669
top-to-bottom fully open collaboration

85
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,430
stack right so call up on top as the

86
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,770
earth as your security fully open

87
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,900
solution Retta is a platform in

88
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,750
underneath power first time this is

89
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,460
possible we thought it was exciting we

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,539
said let's tell people about it

91
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,810
and being in Brussels right now here is

92
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,730
something that I've done over the past

93
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,230
month now comic Brussels regularly if

94
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,750
you're involved in any way shape or form

95
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,810
in this group be it as you know somehow

96
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,560
someone who's a staffer or working on a

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,700
tea staff or knowing someone who is see

98
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,430
here's why I think at the Brussels

99
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,060
bubble as it is also lovingly called

100
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,890
something about look at this statement

101
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,770
so I mean I only tore out the parts to

102
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,000
make anonymized so you would be able to

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,230
tell you meeting where this comes from

104
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,370
this is a statement from website so

105
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,320
without a joint program of development

106
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,300
and production work would be left

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,250
trailing awake of the Americans who

108
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,470
dominated industry and look set to

109
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,020
consolidate the supremacy European firms

110
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,460
would become little more than

111
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,310
subcontractors to American actors

112
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,630
hundreds of thousands of jobs could be

113
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,230
at risk

114
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,510
European economy would be dependent on

115
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,960
the United States this is not about the

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,260
art industry

117
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,090
I took this on a website of a pretty

118
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:18,270
well-known law company this one her boss

119
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:25,140
was the European reaction to the

120
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,710
dominance of us in the entire air

121
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,600
transport industry it was Dean

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,360
strategically important enough that we

123
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,580
needed to do this and build a platform

124
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,030
that we could trust that we could work

125
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,630
with that be European that would also

126
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,020
protect our ability to innovate and our

127
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,000
independence as an economy now a Plains

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
and the entire aerospace industry are

129
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,620
undoubtedly extremely vital and

130
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,080
important however I believe information

131
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,520
technology is even more so perhaps Eva

132
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,310
orders of magnitude because frankly

133
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,080
these guys depend on us and whatever is

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,360
true for them is clearly true for us as

135
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,790
well so I leave what we as a region

136
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,770
speaking as a European here should be

137
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,420
doing although I think our regions in

138
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,770
the world might want to consider doing

139
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,740
the exact same thing we should get

140
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,780
involved in the whole open power story

141
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,760
and for building our own you know start

142
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,730
building our own ships again and have a

143
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,830
technology base which we can actually

144
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,230
rely anything that's unrealistic let me

145
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,700
just tell you that's exactly what the

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,539
Chinese have done

147
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,040
um China is now building its own Opower

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,350
chips they're learning the processor

149
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,660
because it is open design what they did

150
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,970
was they took out these that are you a

151
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,690
crypto that they didn't buy trust and

152
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,250
put in their own bits that they

153
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,040
did trust and building those chips for

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,590
themselves because it's the only way

155
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,740
that they understand they can be

156
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,100
sovereign I believe to do the same and

157
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,710
social probably every other major region

158
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,630
I mean not every country will be likely

159
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,740
able to do this

160
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,630
I think regions would get together and

161
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,530
do this let's take back control at that

162
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,339
level too

163
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,769
so this is more or less I want to leave

164
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,490
you with I think for us as a community

165
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,500
it is time to get to work

166
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,350
together because that is what we'd best

167
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,480
we are a community of technical people

168
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,329
that knows how to actually solve very

169
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:18,750
hard problems as a group collectively

170
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,339
because we know that we can do this as a

171
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,829
global community that is the other part

172
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:28,510
I think we need to contribute to this

173
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,269
because you see when you tell European

174
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,070
policymakers about this there's this

175
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,019
tendency that they now have this

176
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,300
fortress Europe idea where everything

177
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,149
must be only European including like all

178
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,760
the designs and everything right I don't

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,450
think that that will ever work no single

180
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,529
company no single region single country

181
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,670
will ever have all the smart brains in

182
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:05,440
the world as a global population of

183
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
human beings we can solve much better

184
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,430
problems we can solve them in much

185
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,430
better ways and for the benefit of all

186
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,060
of us and so I think that is the

187
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,640
approach we should be taking to this

188
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,980
let's work this together as we do for

189
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,459
the sauver

190
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,589
the free software movement is a global

191
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,260
movement based on these principles let's

192
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,570
apply to harder that's on our what I

193
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,520
tell you thank you

194
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:46,130
[Applause]

195
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,260
all right we have a few minutes

196
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,060
questions thoughts comments reactions

197
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,730
yes I think you need the microphone yes

198
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,360
perfect on yes I'm interested in your

199
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,790
answer from all your experience and the

200
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,100
following question whenever there is a

201
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,740
foundation like that openopenopen

202
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,930
there's also a membership attached of

203
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,730
that foundation where you have to pay

204
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,149
several K US dollar to be member of it

205
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,880
and told and to build things so what

206
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,290
would be your answer to the question

207
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,089
what's open about this well so if you

208
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,200
are an individual or in an academic

209
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,750
institution the open for membership is

210
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,529
actually fee

211
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,910
there's no I saw this but you have a

212
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,940
non-voting right I saw it on the website

213
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,010
too so I don't know what it means really

214
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,500
but okay you can't and then academic on

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,160
an associate I saw that but where it's a

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,010
very reduced sort of participation for

217
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,660
example can't vote that's just what I

218
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,000
saw from the website so I was what just

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
be interested in what open about this

220
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,170
Murshid thing that all those forum

221
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,420
didn't have well I mean so the point is

222
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,839
its voting about things like the bylaws

223
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,459
or the membership fees for the in the

224
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,070
industry members the only way you can or

225
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,680
want to influence this I don't

226
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,160
necessarily think so if you are involved

227
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,380
in this professionally some way which is

228
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,980
what most companies are right then

229
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,160
membership fees are a natural part of of

230
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,250
these associations because they organize

231
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,620
events they have staff I think they have

232
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,029
a security or these kind of things

233
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,270
either expenses need to be paid so the

234
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,579
members themselves pay them I agree that

235
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,959
being able to participate more is always

236
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,980
a good thing

237
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,160
[Music]

238
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,279
what I live is that at the end the

239
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,089
ability to engage in the design process

240
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,069
and provide the input is extremely

241
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:10,870
valuable and I never said open power

242
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,730
foundation was as it stands to deck

243
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,449
perfect

244
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,160
I think it can improve which I think has

245
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,529
to improve but the way we improve it is

246
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,629
by getting involved is my experience

247
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:24,550
well do you have to pay for it okay

248
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,569
Jonathan Toews

249
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm just okay but when you have sixty

250
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,339
thousand when you have to pay $60,000 to

251
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,199
be an involved I was just wondering

252
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,810
about that okay thank you well you don't

253
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,479
that's early we don't pay 60,000 go

254
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,740
hi so I run a medium-sized into plow

255
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,199
couple of thousand bores I'm sorry I

256
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,509
runs from medium-sized internal clouds

257
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,819
about a couple of thousand cores and we

258
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,819
went to our spires vendors we have

259
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,220
multiple hardware vendors and ask for

260
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,610
open power harder to test and turns out

261
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,490
that none of them actually advertise

262
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,110
that they're some them and the ones that

263
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,480
do actually sell them you need to start

264
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,189
with some kind of weird violet program

265
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:27,819
you cannot just go and buy some so so

266
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,810
what is your experience that so I don't

267
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,970
know when that was this was like last

268
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,980
one interesting because I know that

269
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,329
they've been trying which country was

270
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:46,329
this the Netherlands okay get in touch

271
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:48,189
with sort that out because I mean I know

272
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:51,300
that that shipping individual boxes

273
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,490
easily I mean I know who didn't know who

274
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,699
spoke to it the problem I mean I can

275
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,430
tell the person I don't know years for

276
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,500
instance Avnet affecting as a global

277
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,160
distributor for power hardware they

278
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,889
usually I have to actually provide boxes

279
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,060
through that program as well

280
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,030
we need a microphone

281
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,520
can you fix my desktop this it's using

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,529
Intel I want to use for eight or nine

283
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,460
and since so tell us workstation failed

284
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,910
either any possibility for us to get

285
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,310
four computers or is it me for cloud

286
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,250
computing what so you can get chips the

287
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,260
problems you need them everything else

288
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,029
goes with them right like you know the

289
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,399
actual motherboard all that kind of

290
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,339
stuff so Talos was trying to do just

291
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,120
that unfortunately they didn't succeed I

292
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,950
hope they were they or someone else will

293
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,459
try again because I also warned that

294
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:13,060
kind of machine as myself it would have

295
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,680
been very very important for us for them

296
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,980
to succeed they didn't but I don't think

297
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,080
we should let that stop us hi thank you

298
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,100
for the talk when will the x86 patents

299
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,529
acquire I mean surely must expire at

300
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,950
some point in the distant future and - I

301
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,140
don't think the Talos project failed

302
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,440
I think the ground for crowd funding

303
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,180
mechanism failed because why should

304
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,270
there be a time limit on crowdfunding

305
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,770
why don't we why don't we just consider

306
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,830
it an investment and then when the funds

307
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,260
reached the second arid point that is

308
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,500
needed for the product and it goes off

309
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
running it's a stupid thing to have the

310
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,320
term limits I it's too arbitrary I agree

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,939
I I think I'm doing it in the way that

312
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,770
it was done including with a time limit

313
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,599
was perhaps not the best way of going

314
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,059
about it for them of course it means

315
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,309
because it failed they got absolutely no

316
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:19,839
money out of this so there and they seem

317
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,209
to be asking themselves off right now

318
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,679
from from what I can see in terms of

319
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,080
communication and kind of try to figure

320
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,809
out what to do I think if we set them a

321
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:33,970
strong message of can you please now

322
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,740
find a way to do this because we want

323
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,240
maybe we can convince them to come back

324
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,850
do the turtles not the hair

325
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,060
slow and steady duds and what about the

326
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,460
pants the x86 happens surely at some

327
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,170
distant point in the future we can build

328
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,520
our own xa6 I mean I mean in 2,000 years

329
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,310
in a billion years the pants must expire

330
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,210
right sure or do they have like magic

331
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,220
tricks to maintain the patterns forever

332
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,500
well first of all they're usually quite

333
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,240
good stacking patterns on pants right I

334
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,730
mean they don't stop filing for new ones

335
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,020
so you will be able to I don't know you

336
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,700
might be able to build to 86 at some

337
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,970
point but the question is will he want

338
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,980
to and you know we're we're looking at

339
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,710
games of speed and scale with these

340
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,190
things and that's I mean that's

341
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,360
something you have to learn the hard way

342
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,210
I guess sometimes that scale actually

343
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,830
mirrors a lot so oh thank you for the

344
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,530
dog and I actually have two questions

345
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,490
for questions first question is well by

346
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,970
which patents and India you are bound in

347
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,520
case you want to build your own open or

348
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,900
impairment age and the second question

349
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,320
is more specific what will you do in

350
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,740
order to replace PCI Express which is

351
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,910
heavily bound by well a lot of my piece

352
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,900
and the patterns gospel PCI Express is

353
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,510
current industry standards for

354
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:23,800
comparison quiesce peripherals and there

355
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,190
is dependence part but the transport is

356
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,190
mostly dead but and there is nothing

357
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,290
else which can be used in order to build

358
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,950
truly open platform okay I had problems

359
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,320
understanding full question but so first

360
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,380
of all the the patent question though

361
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,270
the way that I'm gonna set this up is

362
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,910
effectively a you get the right to you

363
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,010
that's all but the

364
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,020
a certain level of non assertion in the

365
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,910
sense of you're not attacking anyone and

366
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,440
you're not using them aggressively and

367
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,540
and you know you you're essentially

368
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,580
saying play nice with each other which

369
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,340
actually a way it is stone reminds me a

370
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,200
lot of the way that the oh I and a set

371
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,080
up as any way to small work around the

372
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
pet problem to make it you know it I

373
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,620
mean we all know patents are an issue

374
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,630
but that's at least a way of trying to

375
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,910
live with the problem so you can if if

376
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,100
if you become a member there you can

377
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,510
definitely amuse the technology if

378
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,620
you're not one I'm I still believe you

379
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,960
could get non assertion guarantees

380
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,700
because the interest is not in asserting

381
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,140
the patents that the interest in

382
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,320
actually making technology take off and

383
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,030
there's things like the open copy

384
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,890
standard and so on which are building

385
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,500
interface standards that are lot wise

386
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,670
open because a lot of the industry even

387
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,440
the very big players have gone to

388
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,490
understand that the parent monopoly

389
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,460
follows from sir patents creates issues

390
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,360
for them that are much worse than the

391
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,630
benefits are from holding maybe a patent

392
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
or they're on certain technologies

393
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,970
themselves iBM has understood that if

394
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,860
they were to try to assert all the

395
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,470
patents on the power of that form then

396
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,960
the perform would be dead they they have

397
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,760
no way to get people engaged with this

398
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,890
no one would want to make them so

399
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,610
subject to that kind of litigation so

400
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,540
from it was a clear decision we want to

401
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,880
give this out to the point that I know

402
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,160
some companies have asked even for

403
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,200
exclusive rights regional exclusive

404
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,800
rights on building port chips and IBM

405
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,810
sets alright no can do we don't have

406
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,430
those rights in or there in the front

407
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,860
eight so interpretation is not gonna

408
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,390
give this to you I don't have a question

409
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,440
by have some answers to dr questions so

410
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,690
for the paid membership know there is an

411
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,570
exception as an open source company you

412
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,130
can get free membership

413
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,080
which gives you voting rights okay it's

414
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,030
really limited but you still have voting

415
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,330
rights as for getting hardware boxes you

416
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,280
can contact collab or you can contact me

417
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,070
I have actually boxes from IBM which I

418
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,140
got to do development and I'm doing

419
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,780
development on them you can actually

420
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,669
build everything from the beginning from

421
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:30,190
the firmware till the end whatever you

422
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,520
want

423
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,870
thank you okay

424
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,190
we're still a couple of minutes maybe

425
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,169
one question but but it's actually

426
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:43,770
completely done

427
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,910
[Music]

428
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,470
yeah hello so I assume you do

429
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,270
collaborative hardware development also

430
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,360
so my question is how low-level is this

431
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,460
harder development because I also work

432
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,860
in the hardware see and how do you deal

433
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,600
with the cost associated with producing

434
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,980
this hardware then well I mean if you

435
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,320
desire to eventually to build there

436
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,330
there's I mean if you wanna use it

437
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,510
anyway and will involve cost however

438
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,400
what you will find in an association

439
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,950
such as of the open power foundation you

440
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,130
will find others who may have interest

441
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,170
in sharing those costs with you if they

442
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,670
have an interest in neutral platform

443
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,070
that is what I believe in since Google

444
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,420
and Rackspace are done with their

445
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,460
platform they've together developed a

446
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,280
platform that they both warned and so

447
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,740
then share some of the cost right so you

448
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,930
can actually come together to solve

449
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,570
those issues or try to find one of the

450
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,490
other hardware and lecturers in there

451
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,920
and work with them to organise access

452
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,190
tribution

453
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,770
[Music]

454
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,480
well it is as low as you want to go I

455
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,010
mean it starts from the chip right Tom

456
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,500
is the inside the chip there's also a

457
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,290
lot of different components like this

458
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,080
memory component so you all look at the

459
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,910
even at that level yeah I mean the power

460
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,090
9 chip changes the way it does its whole

461
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,070
core design and sense of like how the

462
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,140
different parallel cores are working and

463
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,210
how they are in fact set up and

464
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,570
configured they've changed that to be

465
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,780
even more useful for the use cases

466
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,880
people who are running on this in their

467
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,840
data centers so power 9 actually

468
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,610
reflects that change the local question

469
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,650
you'd like to know others could relate

470
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,990
to Open Compute Project and you have you

471
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,030
thought about sharing

472
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,300
with visible I think that aptly what

473
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,010
should happen

474
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,470
I warned all the old hardware projects

475
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,450
the Open Compute Project and so on I

476
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,670
want this to start working together

477
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,960
because we can design it but we also

478
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,120
need way to build it to distribute it to

479
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,030
scale it to later service it and so we

480
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,130
need an ecosystem it infrastructure

481
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,430
around this so let's use the one that

482
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,040
exists and I'm out of time thank you

483
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:34,540
[Applause]
