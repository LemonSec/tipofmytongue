1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,500
speaker will be vestment talking about

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,169
ethics in internet measurements hi

3
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:20,490
everyone I'm Vesna and I'm an techno

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,710
addict so as Community Builder

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,509
at ripe ncc and as a hacker I'm

6
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,080
committed to questioning the values that

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,070
we built into our communities and into

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:49,100
our technologies technical is political

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,010
technology is not politically neutral

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,589
every time when we make a technical

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,769
decision for design of our software of

12
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,140
our systems of our Hardware those

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,470
decisions have consequences

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,450
they have social consequences because

15
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,409
they influence the distribution of power

16
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,179
and privilege in the society and the

17
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,820
values and the points of view that we

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,299
that we have that we use in making those

19
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,929
decisions reflect our ethics as hackers

20
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,109
we used to be on the margins of the

21
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,219
society but since the Internet has

22
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,859
become more important in the life of a

23
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,520
lot of people users normal people

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,240
everyday people now we as hackers also

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,630
have gained much more considerable power

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,179
and now we have the responsibility to

27
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,770
use that power for good

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,990
but what is good so as as a young

29
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,699
scientist as a young engineer as a young

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,670
hacker I used to believe that the

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,210
Internet is making the world a better

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,720
place and now 20 years later I'm afraid

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,980
that the Internet is actually helping to

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,980
destroy the world so I have been kind of

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,970
thorn between this bright side of the

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,810
symbol where I've been thinking about

37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,200
the Utopia that we are going to bring to

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,710
the world and had this technology missed

39
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,970
point of view and the more dystopian

40
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,420
visions and the more techno pessimistic

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,120
point of view as of recently and then I

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,459
started studying ethics which is this

43
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,010
area in the middle it's this gray line

44
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,700
is this gray area on the edges of these

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,830
decisions and the edges of these areas

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,590
and this is how I try to help to

47
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,440
visualize it to myself and try to

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,930
present it to you in this talk so this

49
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,690
talk is going to have three parts first

50
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,540
of all I'm going to introduce the ethics

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,770
and the dilemmas in the science and with

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,260
which areas of the sciences had to deal

53
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,630
with these moral dilemmas in the past

54
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,570
and currently then I'm going to explain

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,170
on the example of ripe Atlas how we have

56
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,180
dealt with these ethical dilemmas and

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,070
then finally I'm going to talk about the

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,590
predictions for the future or advice and

59
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,550
tips for how we can go beyond technology

60
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,110
and only the one of these parts is

61
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,140
actually what I do for my work so the

62
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,490
first part and the last part are more

63
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,440
thing that I'm passionate about in my

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,750
free time so we will also see the

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,120
difference between the quality in the

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,940
preparedness and the fact that I have

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,850
for this talk but I have been studying

68
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,030
these other areas a lot and a lot of

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,950
material is available to you in the

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,640
notes the definition of ethics is a

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,550
branch of philosophy which is studying

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,970
what is good and what is evil so this is

73
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,780
actually very important for for my way

74
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,090
of thinking of how can we approach the

75
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,160
the Internet and the development of the

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,370
technologies and so since I'm not a

77
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,640
social scientist I went and read the

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,890
paper by by a group of people who went

79
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,860
into a workshop which was then produced

80
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,310
results called philosophy meets Internet

81
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,980
engineering and a lot of these

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,110
conclusions are based on on such a paper

83
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,330
and this is very good my introduction to

84
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,210
the practical ethics and so in this

85
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,920
paper it says there are three major ways

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,540
of looking into ethical considerations

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,490
consequentialism the ontology and virtue

88
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,020
ethics and translated to kind of a

89
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,370
five-year-old language is the first one

90
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,800
it means the first one is the ends

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
justify the means

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,510
so if the the consequences are good then

93
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,280
it's okay it's fine we are doing fine

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,640
the ontology is the opposite it says the

95
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,830
means should be good the means should be

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,990
moral and then the consequences don't

97
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,540
really matter we can kind of disregard

98
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,240
what the actual effects are and the

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,500
third one says if the actors are good if

100
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,830
you are a good person then whatever you

101
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,840
do whichever means you use of whatever

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,320
the consequences are are going to be

103
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,900
okay because they

104
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,960
have been created by a good person so

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,610
you only have to make sure that you're a

106
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,800
virtuous person now all of these

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,080
approaches have their pros and cons and

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,900
it's kind of difficult to implement them

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,330
in practice so there are three ways to

110
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,389
combine them the principle is implore

111
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,949
ilysm and casuistry and the principle

112
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,160
ISM is mostly used with research of the

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,500
human subjects and it says well make

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,440
sure that you are respecting these major

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,919
principles the pluralism says use

116
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,039
multiple of these methods and combine

117
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,240
them and try to get the best of both of

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,660
all three and three says well let's look

119
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,580
at the things in case to case basis less

120
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,590
than B so theoretical as just look at

121
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,510
these examples that we have and maybe

122
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,880
the similar examples from the past and

123
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,000
make decisions in case to case basis so

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,880
all of these can be applied to the

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,740
internet research if we look at the

126
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,070
science from the neutral point of view

127
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,410
then we can look at these categories of

128
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,889
sciences and we get the life sciences

129
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,770
and the formal and physical and so on

130
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,169
and then there is applied sciences which

131
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,909
is mostly the technology that we are

132
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,330
concerned with like engineering computer

133
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,360
science and all of them have ways of

134
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,190
looking at them from the techni up

135
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,590
Tamizh and techno pessimist point of

136
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,289
view so the optimists say science is

137
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,409
wonderful it's improving our lives it's

138
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:07,000
progress it's bringing the advantages to

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,060
all of us while the pessimists look at

140
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,520
the darker sides and so they're always

141
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,099
in all of them dilemmas that people had

142
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,970
to deal with for example nuclear

143
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,050
scientists they had to ask themselves

144
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,880
should we take part in developing the

145
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
atomic bomb

146
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,889
we think that nuclear energy is

147
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,980
beneficial or other more dangers and how

148
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,340
do we balance this the similar thing for

149
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,260
the medical science is of course their

150
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,400
advantages but you there has been a lot

151
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,810
of ethical and moral dilemmas for the

152
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,880
medical practitioners and then there is

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
environmental movement that brought up

154
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
ethics ethical questions in the usages

155
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,430
of pesticides and fertilizers and so

156
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,120
these are some of the examples and some

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,580
now we come to the examples closer to us

158
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,089
from the Computer Sciences so then there

159
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,580
is cryptography and artificial

160
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,339
intelligence where the robots can

161
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,760
actually bring us a lot of help but they

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,570
can also kill people you can get

163
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,120
cryptography for enhancing the privacy

164
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,030
or there it can be used for surveillance

165
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,120
and then you can use the databases to

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,520
track people based on certain categories

167
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,339
and then the networking so I will talk

168
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,490
mostly about networking in the the next

169
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,450
slide and there is also a programming

170
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,570
side of the Computer Sciences so here I

171
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,540
don't really have to tell you and force

172
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,940
them about the free software but I had

173
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,530
to include it into the slides for the

174
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,500
completeness so you could use the

175
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,230
programming for freedom or you can use

176
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,040
it for profit

177
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,400
and this also expresses your ethical

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,950
values and it also embeds the ethical

179
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,950
values in the software and how can it be

180
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,900
used further so in this way the the code

181
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,069
is politics

182
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,230
and now for hackers

183
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,230
so the hackers has been seen as those

184
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,399
people who are using technology in the

185
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,489
unconventional way so in the playful way

186
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,529
in the creative way or even in the

187
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,139
disruptive way so in that sense the

188
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:39,499
hackers have a very dialectic

189
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:42,199
relationship with the technology on one

190
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:47,989
hand the more tech the more material for

191
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:50,629
the hackers to hack and to play with on

192
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,420
the other hand since they try to break

193
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,069
it and try to use it for the

194
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,329
unconventional purposes they discover

195
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,489
vulnerabilities they discover the holes

196
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,499
they discover different ways in which

197
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,470
technology can be used but then that

198
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,720
gets incorporated into the mainstream

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
technology again and then it gets used

200
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,839
for the mainstream goals the ones that

201
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,790
hackers didn't intend it to so there is

202
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,519
always this kind of power struggle

203
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,919
between the hackers and the mainstream

204
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,269
scientists and the technologists and the

205
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,730
ethical side of the hacking has been

206
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,819
documented very well

207
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,009
this is just one of the examples there

208
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,290
are other ways to look at it so the

209
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,079
sharing and openness and freedom have

210
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:45,339
been embedded into the ethics of hackers

211
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,029
and still this is a very positive istic

212
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,970
view so in the last part of the of this

213
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,709
presentation I will come back to this

214
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,369
and see how how these hackers ethics can

215
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,249
actually be used on itself to question

216
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:06,230
its own premises so the hackers ethics

217
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,540
is very much connected with the early

218
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,059
days of the internet where the internet

219
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,220
was also supposed to bring us all the

220
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,649
freedom and to connect us to each other

221
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,579
to enable communication so that people

222
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,559
are going to get greater understanding

223
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,260
of each other and so the

224
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,060
conflicts can be avoided if we would all

225
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,550
be able to talk to to each other it's

226
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,110
going to bring the freedom and the

227
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,930
democracy and to liberate us all this is

228
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,400
a very technical acquaint view but in

229
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,510
the recent years there have been other

230
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,210
sides of Internet technologies revealed

231
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,730
and what do the techno pessimists sieve

232
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,770
and they look at the internet nowadays

233
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,650
well there is the huge usage of energy

234
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,180
which also includes the usage of fossil

235
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,550
fuels and all the consequences that come

236
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,230
from that there is the exploitation of

237
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,250
the people who are creating and building

238
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,560
the Internet so the people who have to

239
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,930
mine for the resources to build all of

240
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,300
the equipment and the people who

241
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,700
actually build our equipment and then

242
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,990
there is the pollution of the

243
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:28,170
environment the Internet can help us to

244
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,420
delete our differences but it actually

245
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,870
also increases the differences and

246
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,760
deepens the digital divide while if the

247
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,670
first world gets the clouds and the

248
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,470
shiny data centers the third world

249
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,030
children have to work in the mines and

250
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,970
have to pick through our electronic

251
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,490
waste so this is another way to look at

252
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,100
the effects of the technology then there

253
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,080
is surveillance I won't even go into

254
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,130
this because this has actually been kind

255
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,260
of predicted by the philosophers of

256
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,070
Technology in the 80s where they said

257
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,180
that if a government would ask us to

258
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,810
carry a device which can reveal our

259
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,430
location at all times and it can listen

260
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,620
to our conversations it can take

261
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,420
photographs and then share them with

262
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,100
authorities we would refuse that we

263
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,900
would even revolt against such an idea

264
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,630
if it would have been brought from the

265
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,710
on the political grounds but if it is

266
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,470
presented to us as technical innovation

267
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,960
well we all have mobile phones nowadays

268
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,610
so this is also something to think about

269
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,029
how else is the political connected with

270
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,900
the Internet

271
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,960
well there is Internet governance but

272
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,779
this is much larger topic I can talk

273
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,480
about this for for an hour and you will

274
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,460
probably have to come to shot to the

275
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,740
next Dutch hackers came to hear me talk

276
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,400
about this so Internet in order to

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,610
determine how the internet functions we

278
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,910
need to perform the measurements now we

279
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,160
attack is via engineers of course we can

280
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,430
do measurements we know how to do this

281
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,160
but the measurements on the Internet are

282
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,290
not only a technical problem anymore

283
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,310
because the Internet has become this

284
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,290
whole social technical system we do have

285
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,930
to consider other things when conducting

286
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,959
internet measurements now and so this is

287
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,029
why now the internet engineers and the

288
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,400
software developers and the researchers

289
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,650
have to busied themselves with studying

290
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,959
things like ethics so since we are more

291
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,410
knowledgeable than the users that we are

292
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,290
conducting these experiments on we have

293
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,870
the responsibilities towards them so we

294
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,380
have to explain to them what information

295
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,560
are they sharing with us what kind of

296
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,670
impact can debt have and we have to get

297
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,150
their consent but not just for them to

298
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,670
click on the terms of services we have

299
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,790
to get their meaningful informed consent

300
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,200
they have to understand what they are

301
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,839
signing if there if they are agreeing to

302
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,589
that so that's one thing so we have to

303
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,990
deal with with people and even when

304
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,820
designing the experiments we have to

305
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,600
wait the Ben

306
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,660
it's for us and the costs that are

307
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,180
probably not going to be borne by us but

308
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,790
by somebody else so for this we have to

309
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,290
consider all these ethical

310
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,600
considerations that have been talking

311
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,690
about and there is a helpful graph for

312
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,209
this so if you are going to do the the

313
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,730
measurements on the Internet the papers

314
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,020
that are referenced in my slides

315
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,929
actually cover this this is one of the

316
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,609
diagrams that you can that you can

317
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,020
follow okay so this was kind of the

318
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,449
preparation for the example now how many

319
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:27,750
of you have heard about ripe ncc great

320
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,970
how many of you have heard about ripe

321
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,730
apples before it's kind of the same

322
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,059
people and it's almost two thirds but I

323
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,559
have to do this very short introduction

324
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,960
so ripe ncc is one of the internet

325
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,789
registries regional internet registry

326
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,169
for europe middle east and former Soviet

327
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,780
republics so this yellow part on the on

328
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,210
the slide and there is four more

329
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,130
regional internet registries and so we

330
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,950
embed the ethics in our work in a way

331
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,840
that we are all not-for-profit

332
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,559
organizations we are all open and

333
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,650
transparent via neutral and we are

334
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,190
governed by the communities by our

335
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,250
members and we are accountable to these

336
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,039
members to these communities one of the

337
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,679
main jobs of the regional internet

338
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,830
registry and reppin cc2 is to distribute

339
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,549
IP addresses so we distribute them in

340
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,860
the hierarchical fashion we get them

341
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,059
from Ayana

342
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,419
and then we pass them on to local

343
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,070
internet registries which are mostly

344
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,400
Internet service providers corporations

345
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,320
banks governments so large or

346
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,990
that need a lot of addresses and then

347
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,820
they give them further to their

348
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,730
customers to the end users and I'm only

349
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,120
talking about ipv6 addresses because you

350
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,510
all know that this is the current

351
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,460
internet protocol and the other one is a

352
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,480
legacy one because there isn't any ipv4

353
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:23,540
left and yeah good so there are small

354
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,490
bits and pieces that you can still get

355
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,710
so there is one last block for every

356
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,350
member of the ripe NCC and that's it so

357
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,800
move on and get ipv6 I have to say this

358
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,890
it's not part of my talk so ripe Atlas

359
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,350
apart from from distributing these IP

360
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,050
addresses as a neutral organization ripe

361
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,210
NCC is also performing internet

362
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,330
measurements so we have this platform

363
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,770
for mapping the health of the Internet

364
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,570
and we do that by distributing small

365
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,700
hardware devices that are hosted by

366
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,360
volunteers these hardware devices

367
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,850
continuously do the ping traceroute and

368
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,740
DNS measurements towards critical

369
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,480
Internet infrastructure the root

370
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,230
nameservers

371
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,500
we can collect that information publish

372
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,070
it so it's all open data and we

373
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,200
visualize it as maps so that's why Atlas

374
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,300
so it's like a collection of maps about

375
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,660
the reach ability of critical

376
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,480
infrastructure on the Internet

377
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,770
so these devices perform measurements

378
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,680
for us and for the Internet community

379
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,790
but they also can perform the

380
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,450
measurements for the other users of the

381
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,390
ripe Atlas system and so this is where

382
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,850
part of our ethical considerations come

383
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,730
into place because if you have one of

384
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,300
these things at home you allow 10,000

385
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,830
other people to do the measurements from

386
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,149
how's and you don't know them they are

387
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,230
not your friends

388
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,450
they are actually connected to you only

389
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,090
through through this platform so this is

390
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,039
what we had to have in mind when we were

391
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,179
designing the right path was the main

392
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:23,519
goal is to measure the health of the

393
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,350
infrastructure and to do the

394
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,970
troubleshooting and monitoring of your

395
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,970
own network but some people have been

396
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,049
using it for looking at for the

397
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,450
detection of the network interference

398
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,340
because that's also what happens like

399
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,580
some people block parts of the internet

400
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,049
deliberately sometimes there are outages

401
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:45,720
and so on so although that was not the

402
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,970
intended purpose for iPod plus some

403
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,710
researchers are actually using it for

404
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,130
that and they have taken into

405
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,990
consideration the fact that it wasn't

406
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,529
meant for that and in their paper they

407
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,260
actually have a large section about

408
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,389
ethical considerations so if you're

409
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,649
curious take a look at that one so how

410
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,370
did we actually build all this into into

411
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,720
the design of the system at the

412
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
beginning so we have decided to not

413
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,179
measure bandwidth so we don't really

414
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,389
look at your normal traffic we only

415
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,240
generate extra traffic like pings and

416
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,130
trace routes and that is so that we can

417
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,950
claim that we don't have any access to

418
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,840
the users traffic that actually makes

419
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,909
the value of the measurements and of the

420
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:42,600
platform for certain purposes smaller

421
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,909
because people actually want the

422
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,760
bandwidth to be measured because they

423
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,789
don't realize that if you measure their

424
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,320
actual traffic you are going to

425
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,850
interfere with that you're going to make

426
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,250
it slower and you can actually look into

427
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,860
what is there so we decided not to do

428
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,549
that so that's one thing we only do

429
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,070
active measurements then all the data

430
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,340
that we collect is made public and it's

431
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,050
freely available

432
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,610
the api's that we use are also

433
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,070
documented and freely available there so

434
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,040
the source code of the measurements on

435
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,340
the probe is there on github and then

436
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,590
the tools that we provide and the tower

437
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,020
users right are also free software and

438
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,880
the the last thing that I want to

439
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,170
mention because then there are more

440
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,090
things they are all published already

441
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,440
under on the FOSDEM interview page the

442
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,930
measurements that those probes do are

443
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,420
not freely configurable so you can only

444
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,830
do the measurements that are already

445
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,410
there which is paying traceroute dns as

446
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,330
a cell and so on you can't tell - the

447
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,390
probe or go and do this that that won't

448
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,510
work so we had deliberately limited the

449
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,790
number of features so that the dangers

450
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,740
to the users would be less we don't know

451
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,480
all those users but some of them have

452
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
cats and we really don't want to any

453
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,340
harm to come to those cats and this is

454
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,890
the auto photo of the of the probe

455
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,440
itself so you can see the the probe and

456
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,900
you can also get the mandatory cat

457
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,220
picture in a presentation

458
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,809
[Applause]

459
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,629
so once we have come up with a system

460
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:35,850
well it wasn't over we had to deal with

461
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,799
all kinds of questions later on

462
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,139
especially because we have a very

463
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:43,710
critical community like you guys and so

464
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,980
people kept saying wait a minute what do

465
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,460
you mean you have to trust the code

466
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,559
which is on that probe you want me to

467
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
put a probe in my house but I can't

468
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,639
actually see what it does so yeah we had

469
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,919
to release the source code there was a

470
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,850
talk about that last year it was them

471
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,049
then we wanted to make our life easier

472
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,169
and to say okay all the measurements are

473
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,559
public so we don't have to put a lot of

474
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,350
work in protecting the data that people

475
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,129
consider not public measurements and so

476
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,350
we suggested that our community and they

477
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,799
didn't like it so we decided to actually

478
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,309
keep the feature of non public

479
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:32,070
measurements and so that that's still

480
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,919
there so if you are deploying some new

481
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,019
part of the data center whatever and you

482
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:38,519
want to do the measurements to that

483
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,109
equipment but you don't want everybody

484
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,720
to know immediately what the performance

485
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,730
is or whatever some of those

486
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,580
measurements can still be marked

487
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,489
non-public and they will be not easy to

488
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,499
find through the Atmos system but that's

489
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:55,919
why we don't call them private because

490
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,720
they're actually never going to be

491
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,220
private private then in 2015 we

492
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,149
introduced HTTP measurements but we also

493
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,789
kept them very limited they only can be

494
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:14,399
done towards so-called ripe Atlas

495
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,019
anchors which are part of our

496
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,090
infrastructure and are controlled by us

497
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,700
so they cannot be performed by users to

498
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,769
random web sites on the Internet

499
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:25,019
this is a way to protect the users

500
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,909
especially in the countries with

501
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:29,609
oppressive regimes where if you would go

502
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,429
to a forbidden website then there would

503
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:34,859
be really harsh consequences for your

504
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,740
life in real life

505
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,909
so this is another way to deal with

506
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:45,169
these dilemmas and then we also perform

507
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,090
the security audit and the results are

508
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,380
published on our website on this URL

509
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,240
because our community is partially

510
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,580
hackers and hackers are going to hack so

511
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,190
we got a lot of reports of people

512
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,960
opening The probe's like oh yeah let's

513
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,140
just see what it actually does and yeah

514
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,080
it actually does what we say but sure go

515
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,460
and check it out and so they they were

516
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,110
very nice to actually follow the

517
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,909
responsible disclosure procedure first

518
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:19,429
tell us what they have discovered and

519
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,440
there were some bugs there's always bugs

520
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,440
so we fixed them and then we publish you

521
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,760
know the the report there yeah that's

522
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,960
what you get with the critical community

523
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,640
so we also have a lot of probes at

524
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,450
hacker spaces

525
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,090
if your hacker space doesn't have one I

526
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,980
will have some probes with me tomorrow

527
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,049
or you can also just request them and

528
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,470
then we will ship them to you so if you

529
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,320
want to take part in England's day we

530
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,720
already had four and there is another

531
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,740
one coming up in Amsterdam or if you are

532
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,309
a student or a researcher you can get

533
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,429
help to present your work at the

534
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,799
conferences that we organized the so

535
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:07,700
called drive meetings you can apply if

536
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,340
you are researching some of these topics

537
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,179
or if you want to write a report about

538
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,460
some project and so on and reach the

539
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,980
right community we have a platform for

540
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,840
right labs where you can publish that

541
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,850
research do we take questions only at

542
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,960
the end or now how are we doing with

543
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,090
that now we move on okay

544
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,859
so this was the end of the official part

545
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:44,299
and from now on the the rest is just my

546
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,179
opinions they're not opinions of my

547
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:56,649
employer this is all on video hi boss

548
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:03,409
so what I want to to explore here is how

549
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,779
do we go beyond the technological

550
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:13,429
optimism and and some of the advices

551
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,729
that I kind of summarize from all the

552
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:18,649
literature that I read preparing for

553
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:22,959
this talk is question everything

554
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:26,509
embrace alternatives embrace diversity

555
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:31,759
and build systems or take part in

556
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,909
systems that support diversity inclusion

557
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:43,479
and protection of the users and of life

558
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:50,330
on earth so very inspirational paper

559
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,279
that I read was actually a transcript

560
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,269
from a talk from a woman who who hacked

561
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:00,229
the hackers ethic so she said well let's

562
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:03,679
replace the hackers ethics with the set

563
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,389
of questions and they are really

564
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,570
interesting questions like how do you

565
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,919
ensure that the computers that access to

566
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,629
the computer should be unlimited in

567
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:24,349
total well to whom who gets to use your

568
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:27,440
technology who doesn't get to use your

569
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,539
technology how is what you are making

570
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,299
making the access for some people more

571
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,139
difficult or easier how is the

572
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:43,570
information free which data are using

573
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,970
whose labor went into

574
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,549
getting the data where it is and so on

575
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,919
so all these questions are really really

576
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,429
interesting and I encourage you to

577
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,080
contemplate on them when you're deciding

578
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,500
about which project to take part in and

579
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,100
what are the consequences of your

580
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:09,299
project and your software for example

581
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,700
how open and inclusive is the hackers

582
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,230
movement and if our community is very

583
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,769
homogeneous as we can see actually even

584
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,659
at looking at this room

585
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:26,559
then how is the technology that we are

586
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,870
making going to be inclusive and

587
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,809
actually help everybody so to that

588
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,620
extent this is a this is a small web

589
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,570
interface where you can change some

590
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,549
parameters to create a different picture

591
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:42,970
which stays on the screen but as a

592
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,289
larger message to all of you I say let's

593
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:50,040
hack patriarchy

594
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:57,770
[Applause]

595
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,560
here are some other questions to use for

596
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,510
conducting your network research on the

597
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,040
internet so there is a lot of

598
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,440
information here I won't let you read

599
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,770
this I will let you read this one

600
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,290
because it's big letters and it's easy

601
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,740
to read

602
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:27,190
so this is from a paper that was very

603
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,190
very inspirational for me from Philly

604
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,789
Broadway its moral considerations of

605
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,570
cryptographic work and it's a very long

606
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,119
paper and then he comes up with with a

607
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,549
lot of advices I have summarized them

608
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:44,710
here for you and then there is like

609
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,789
three that I want to stress take into

610
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:50,979
consideration the ordinary people and

611
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:53,979
their needs when you are developing your

612
00:32:53,979 --> 00:33:00,879
technology get the systems view the

613
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,789
large view they'll get a big picture and

614
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:11,049
contribute to the Commons now again here

615
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:11,739
at FOSDEM

616
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,479
I don't have to really tell you about

617
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:17,349
the Commons you know all about it but I

618
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,269
like this picture because it also has

619
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,399
the yin and yang sign so there you go

620
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,259
and there's a lot of information in the

621
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:28,869
notes now the other thing to consider is

622
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:32,080
how would the internet look like if it

623
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,200
would be built on the feminist ethics on

624
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
the feminist principles and actually

625
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,090
some of the technologists and the

626
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,129
scientists and the engineers the the

627
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:44,739
female technologies scientists and

628
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,690
engineers got together a few years ago

629
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,570
and came up with this document which is

630
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,659
called the feminist internet and so

631
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,940
again in the notes you can see the the

632
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,399
references to this and the logo is quite

633
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:01,539
beautiful too and then there are all

634
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,249
kinds of other movements and other

635
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,679
alternatives that you can consider which

636
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,460
have very similar principles and ethics

637
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,029
to the hackers ethics so there is

638
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:17,589
anarchism there is permaculture there is

639
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,969
the ecological movement Buddhism hippies

640
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,210
so all of these subcultures and ethics

641
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,020
are influencing or could be influencing

642
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,869
our development of the technology

643
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:37,069
and this is the quote from the paper

644
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:39,469
that I just mentioned but then he quotes

645
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,460
the Nobel Prize winner and and his

646
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,909
reception of the of his Nobel Prize he

647
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,909
is a nuclear scientist and and he has

648
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,569
been calling out to his fellow

649
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,449
scientists to take the responsibility

650
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,759
for the not destroying the world and not

651
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:04,369
destroying all the other humans and I

652
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,069
say well since we are there let's also

653
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,960
make sure that we don't destroy

654
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,390
squirrels because maybe our internet is

655
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,479
not the only internet maybe there is

656
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:24,079
also an Internet of trees or the

657
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:34,099
Internet of mycelia and our way of

658
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,289
looking at things doesn't have to be

659
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:38,719
like this doesn't have to be the

660
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,289
hierarchical way but it can be the

661
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,960
decentralized way the way how the nature

662
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,769
is the cyclic oh and so that we are not

663
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,200
at the top of the hierarchy of life

664
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,809
between a part of life on this planet

665
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:58,190
and so our technologies can be so

666
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,880
inclusive that are also not harming and

667
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,279
maybe even contributing to the life on

668
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:10,009
this planet and so this is the message

669
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,829
that I want to leave you with question

670
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:13,869
everything

671
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:19,160
embrace alternatives and contribute to

672
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,110
the life on Earth thank you

673
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:41,550
[Applause]

674
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,690
okay question everything starts with

675
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,620
questioning me

676
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:06,119
[Applause]

677
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,869
okay perfect

678
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:11,230
I'm a thank you for your talk I mean as

679
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:16,000
a community or Packers developers I a

680
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,359
I'm a scientist okay in computational

681
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,790
chemistry it it looks like an oxymoron

682
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,800
but it exists I think at some point of

683
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,440
your talk you trap pass soffit similar

684
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,440
the difference between optimistic and

685
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,280
pessimistic views or of the world and I

686
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,930
can agree with you I mean it's not a

687
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,359
matter of optimistic pessimistic views

688
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,020
and similar responsibilities the

689
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,050
community how we interact each other's

690
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,400
each other how we distribute our

691
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,240
knowledge that's a very big problem too

692
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,460
vigor eyes I will say that it's it does

693
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,869
not mean to make our stuff stupid for

694
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:07,599
people who are not in our field it means

695
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,059
how to communicate to them and my

696
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:19,859
question is do you feel the hacker

697
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:26,260
scientist developer communities though

698
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,240
do they

699
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,329
question do they question so much the

700
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:35,910
authority do they seek for power to

701
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,030
change this world and not made so ugly

702
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,950
something similar or do they go more and

703
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,609
more kind of individualistic I mean I I

704
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,910
looked up a very few groups that

705
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,839
question authority a collective way and

706
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,960
not anyone with ease or air or star own

707
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,280
ethics okay that's that's a very good

708
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,630
question and I think that you already

709
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,089
answered it yourself so there are

710
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:14,920
hackers that do and but they do actually

711
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,010
question authority

712
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:22,420
and work into enabling other ways of

713
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,730
distribution of power empowering those

714
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:30,970
that are weak but I'm afraid that

715
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,859
majority of hackers do not even think

716
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:35,000
about that

717
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,080
majority of hackers are more like

718
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,390
technological thinkers they like to play

719
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,820
with technology and do not like to think

720
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,070
about how is this technology used to for

721
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,570
political purposes and that my can be

722
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,960
dangerous because then all the advances

723
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,550
that they make through their work

724
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,740
through their tinkering can be then

725
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,900
abused by those in power to get even

726
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,190
more power and one of the positive one

727
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,470
of the examples that actually do have

728
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,869
that vision is a group that gave a

729
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,960
presentation few years ago at CCC

730
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,840
Congress which is a group called the

731
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,820
invisible committee and they have now a

732
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,600
book called to our friends which covers

733
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,180
a lot of these questions and I would

734
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,600
recommend that to you any other

735
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,950
questions thank you very much for the

736
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,720
talk let's be practical and so I'm

737
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,760
maintaining an open source project what

738
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,670
can I do practically to make sure that

739
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,619
everything is epic ethical in this

740
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,420
project are there some guidelines is

741
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:00,710
there manifesto or whatever do you know

742
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,520
of a series of guidelines or a manifesto

743
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,690
something clear that can make me so I

744
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,070
can be sure that I do everything I can

745
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,790
ethically for my projects yes so there

746
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,210
are a lot of references in the notes of

747
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,390
my slides and in the paper that we have

748
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,980
published about the ethic

749
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,350
in ripe Atlas measurements that is also

750
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,510
referenced from the force them talk

751
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,480
there is not one paper you will have to

752
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,350
read let's say ten papers to see which

753
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,270
one is relevant for your field of work

754
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,710
and if if it would be that easy to just

755
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,290
put it in one paper we wouldn't have

756
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,520
such a conference so there is a lot of

757
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,130
thinking to be done and questioning so

758
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,070
if you are concerned about something go

759
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,500
deeper and deeper and ask questions of

760
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,070
yourself of your colleagues of your

761
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,470
bigger field until you are happy that

762
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,600
you are actually doing the most ethical

763
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:12,170
work possible so so you mentioned the

764
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,670
ipv6 earlier of course it's a sorry yeah

765
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,730
it's the new standard and everything so

766
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,840
I dig a little bit in the standard

767
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,850
itself recently for developing purpose

768
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,940
and so on and I discovered well I knew

769
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,130
it partly but that it doesn't have

770
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,460
nothing masquerading so basically you

771
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,859
have a very huge number of IP addresses

772
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:40,730
and you'll end up probably having each

773
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,720
device having an ipv6 like maker for mac

774
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,880
addresses so how does the ripe or you

775
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,359
know the Jana Jana like justify that

776
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,090
like because that's actually the

777
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,790
tracking device yes

778
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:02,380
so there is an RFC that actually

779
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,859
describes how can you implement the

780
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:09,830
security extensions for the ipv6 so you

781
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,800
do not have to record the MAC address in

782
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,770
the ipv6 address you can have the

783
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:19,700
pseudo-random number that hide your MAC

784
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,790
address so then your ipv6 address is

785
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,570
your identifier but not your MAC address

786
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,350
is not visible

787
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,490
indeed your comment is you're still

788
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,720
trackable by the IP well that can be

789
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,790
solved by using some other security

790
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,190
privacy whatever measures which I'm not

791
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,300
an expert in but from the ethical point

792
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,410
of view and I already had this

793
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,690
discussion over lunch with somebody we

794
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,330
can actually try to find all kinds of

795
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,840
ways to go around the Big Brother or we

796
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,190
can get rid of the Big Brother

797
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:09,119
[Applause]

798
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,839
hi first thanks for your target was very

799
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,259
interesting I have two questions for you

800
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:36,259
and then I'd like to have a short

801
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:40,430
position on that the first thing is auto

802
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,460
updating the Atmos Pro if you enable all

803
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:49,089
the updates you're in the opportunity to

804
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:51,440
penetrate a private network just by

805
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,609
pushing a backdoor if you're not you are

806
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,269
not able to fix a critical security

807
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:02,150
vulnerability and the second thing I'd

808
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,969
like to hear position is the freedom of

809
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,759
use and open source software it usually

810
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:10,460
includes military use and I don't like

811
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,069
this and this is my biggest problem at

812
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:16,460
open source software so can you explain

813
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,799
your position on these two issues please

814
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,680
so the first one that it was do we have

815
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,009
the automatic updates and how for the

816
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:37,029
right what was firmware so they are

817
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,599
pushed by us so that's the only way of

818
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,579
updating so the the probe tell the probe

819
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,410
only connects to the centralized

820
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,380
infrastructure by ripe NCC and when we

821
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,710
decide that there has to be an update

822
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,410
then we let the probe update itself so

823
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,930
in the meantime if their vulnerabilities

824
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,269
then they avail I mean they are

825
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:04,099
available there the probe is not not

826
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,499
updated so in that dilemma that you

827
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:09,170
presented we have we have chosen one

828
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,849
certain way and the other question is I

829
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:16,969
think discussed very much as a topic at

830
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:17,569
FOSDEM

831
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,789
and I'm sure you can find people who are

832
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:23,329
more knowledgeable than me but if you

833
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,400
want my personal opinion then we can do

834
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:32,150
that over a beer okay if it's okay to

835
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,130
the presenter I have a short reply to

836
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,650
the second question

837
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,960
sure but we have to hurry I know it's

838
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,830
Charlene it's basically it's your your

839
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,190
ethics that decides that it's not okay

840
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,240
so you're asking for contributing giving

841
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,060
to everyone except the bad guys but

842
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,830
you're the one deciding who the bad guys

843
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,080
are and well they should present the

844
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,170
problem to you because yeah it's

845
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,300
subjective always okay you can also have

846
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,040
a conversation over a beer there is a

847
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,290
question over there and let's can we

848
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,820
make that a last one okay I am active in

849
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,430

layer level and so Internet is not made

851
