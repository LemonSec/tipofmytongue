74
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,980
Java Script framework every Tuesday

75
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,040

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,380
did not exist yet

79
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,230
but then when actually existing would

80
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,310
break the Camelot

81
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,480

prime I know coming it is known for his

86
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,480
happiness so you have to use past six

87
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,670
but that you know I don't know how to do

88
