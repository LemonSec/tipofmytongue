1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,589
Azari from the course f team

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,450
talk a little bit about our object

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,010
storage the ratos gateway insect hello

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,350
thank you for coming so early on Sunday

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,619
I know it's hard

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,109
I'm on it I'm part of the safety a mean

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,410
way that and I work on cloud of storage

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,740
set and today we're going to explain

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:33,700
what what cloud objects toys is how

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,489
different regular search types a little

11
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:44,470
bit of a fresh suppose music much we did

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:55,240
no hands so explain provide cloud

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:03,010
storage interface for few questions so

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,860
in then I put for people to ask

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,500
questions during the presentation so if

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,840
someone needs a question just raise your

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,380
hand so let's start working with this

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,640
cloud object sort so we have a black

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,880
shirt anybody

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,000
Google Website although first fold is

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,770
divided into those fixed blocks

22
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,780
depending on the device metadata related

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,180
to the data just write the data

24
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,690
somewhere and device of circular and

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,440
application need to manage to know what

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,870
that we tweaked and their wealth within

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,340
you can have several devices but it's

28
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,140
really fast for storage and today this

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,610
protocol private Janus cars a satire I

30
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,190
study and some people even use fiber

31
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,450
Java of a 10-8 method of using black

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,360
stars really hard applications a bank

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:32,360
loan assistant for this data file

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,480
conveys in any place you can overwrite

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,090
it in the middle and allocate on demand

36
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,810
it's much easier for application through

37
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,520
the search but it's rather block lots of

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:57,980
elements sometimes system people not all

39
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,440
five systems with many have sharing

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:14,590
semantics to the same of the same time

41
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,360
we have like a five system protocol like

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
exit for XFS and so hard and we also

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,230
have network protocol like in the first

44
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,150
an SMB and SP the apple protocol by the

45
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:43,750
day it was the cloud

46
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,849
[Music]

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,479
[Music]

48
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,060
[Music]

49
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,779
[Music]

50
00:04:39,130 --> 00:05:49,100
like complex systems have is really hard

51
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,590
so just two levels we have these buckets

52
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,680
switch Gordon containers reports

53
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,500
so just container of objects is Terrell

54
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,800
to organize your objective to groups and

55
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,920
maybe add some properties for that

56
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,740
so that's bucket and inside the bucket

57
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,650
or of those objects and I'm doctor not

58
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,370
just Delta you the body you can add them

59
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,580
all sort of metadata summer fix that

60
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,310
some you can decide on your own so you

61
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,170
can learn let's find the right now

62
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,770
what's the data in them your views wells

63
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,980
and tenants which is like an abaya for

64
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,030
user to share the same data between them

65
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,700
you have authentication and ownership

66
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,030
access control list and we talked about

67
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:48,010
large objects really large so that means

68
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,700
you need lots of storage become very

69
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,160
large object mutable object are

70
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,720
immutable that means you're either

71
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,140
months if you decide to change them we

72
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,420
need to actually override all the

73
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,790
objects you cannot write in between and

74
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,100
it's much more efficient for those large

75
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,700
objects to be immutable and it's

76
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,360
simplified to allocation save the

77
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,930
particles today the most common one is

78
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,660
valid on XP it's beautiful and even

79
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,600
though scale hours on edge balancer it's

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,350
huge I can't imagine how much search HP

81
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,000
has kept in stock we have Swift and the

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:48,710
Google Cloud Storage put rights and

83
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,099
observe

84
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,060
was in hell you can believe about that

85
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,650
we're to an object that it's not a

86
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,409
symbol of collaboration

87
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,689
this is such a simplification because

88
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:22,229
this is service so it's all sort of

89
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,710
metadata or maybe make the potion more

90
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:34,769
complex so we talked about really large

91
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:51,779
objects we can get to giggles sighs so

92
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,660
these it can be really hard so for that

93
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,100
we have removed apart you want to upload

94
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,600
an object but you want to maybe stop it

95
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
maybe we try so total big objects you

96
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,050
divide it to small parts and each part

97
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,019
is been uploaded or downloaded parallel

98
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,730
so you can handle network problems and

99
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,920
don't know me and it you can continue

100
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,279
where you stopped and you can step start

101
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,760
upload download and also it's good for

102
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,040
streaming for example when you don't

103
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,690
know the size of the objects you're

104
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,740
actually going to upload the download

105
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:46,380
but the smell it's hard for the storage

106
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,360
because I'm

107
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,980
your uploads we burn at the object will

108
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,470
be every caffeinated so we need to start

109
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,300
on the temporary parts and sometimes we

110
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,190
start again

111
00:10:03,190 --> 00:11:28,149
so when you switch value differently so

112
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,779
sorry user password Samuels lose user

113
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,649
and a security key and a secret

114
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,380
everything is really different so the

115
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,279
question is complex object lifecycle for

116
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,740
example we can separate an object and

117
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,380
when

118
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,500
so that base of the preparation website

119
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,380
can be deleted automatically or move to

120
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,020
cold storage and lots of good features

121
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:06,470
any personnel custard let's talk about

122
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,530
safe

123
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,550
so staff is soaked up with cephalopod

124
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,770
which is the family about to process in

125
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,450
school so our version occurs of one

126
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,450
animal that name so the latest stable

127
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,760
version a Joe I think that's funny to

128
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,850
you if I remember so sorry weapon sauce

129
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,210
this is where I give up we serve all

130
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,050
under is over South quad it's not a nice

131
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,540
truck we have our own testing for

132
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,320
multiple challenges Ross open and

133
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,420
additional tests like restful path but

134
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,760
this is free compatibility we have other

135
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,800
component of safe society represents we

136
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,770
are in for them so it's applesauce LGPL

137
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,590
it's such a different stage where we are

138
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,290
in the software if I schedule that means

139
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,190
it can run on many kind of platforms you

140
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,280
can configure an adaptive to different

141
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:23,480
parodies and scale it disabilities thing

142
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,750
and like and I will have anything good

143
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,850
for the favor when you have a large

144
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,370
number of nodes you cannot handle the

145
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,590
single point of failure you because they

146
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,620
assume everything will not scale means

147
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,320
failure happens it's massively scalable

148
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,960
it was built to be not scared

149
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,560
so we can be free nodes but the minimum

150
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,350
is five and I actually recommend more

151
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,570
it's a large-scale system not for

152
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
according to be more efficient space

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,890
because we assume they don't have good

154
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,420
left so we need more copies so lied

155
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,230
system very happen so you want safe here

156
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,180
in because you cannot handle the

157
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,880
struggles Vanilli everything should

158
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,510
happen automatically and we have unified

159
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,230
access rather sacrifice is the name it's

160
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,050
the file system access it's a positive

161
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,780
time file system we can use our client

162
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,740
kids or our camera client and there is

163
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,630
introversion to oppos'd at Manila and

164
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,460
you can use any first Ganesha with it

165
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,450
for an FSO samba simba I believe the

166
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,750
black route affects many nodes for water

167
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,640
stop it's suitable control with qmu so

168
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,060
you can use it with kimi o 4 n oq k vm

169
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,430
and you can use the caret right if you

170
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,450
want you're on the device and web

171
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,820
spectral width which is the component of

172
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,030
the right cloud object storage

173
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,570
underneath we solve the earth brothers

174
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,410
and I'm going to batters the distributed

175
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,650
object storage so we see in phenom

176
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,580
dacoits which is interesting so once

177
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,660
that started it

178
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,430
let's build a very fast

179
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,720
I system and the star would read us to

180
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,110
be lever which objects oil but you can

181
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:06,130
build up a system on it really wet

182
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,110
working with the beauty fascism is never

183
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,660
simple even if you have used to build

184
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,250
object storage underneath

185
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,220
and in the movie I will put to the web

186
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,880
so fast the style BB and others great

187
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,210
life and now we have such a fascist

188
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,770
production so are this bar Travis does

189
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,660
it does all the distributor so it's does

190
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,480
all the application and recording it's a

191
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,470
slight object constants and we call we

192
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,390
have a pair of object and we can

193
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:53,530
configure it for that could be available

194
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,320
to be butchered application to be free

195
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,340
role could be Reza codes that would

196
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,319
strongly consistent system and it's up

197
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,020
to define that minutes is the word tulo

198
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,109
infrastructure and the topology and it

199
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,829
matches two different archetypes turbine

200
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,980
systems for placement

201
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,800
we have a house based algorithm with no

202
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,880
lookup called crush anyone performance

203
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:54,140
so we serve to the but it's not very

204
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,030
efficient in large-scale it's a

205
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,270
bottleneck surprise seven choir may look

206
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,359
up it is

207
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,850
so that's men you can actually put in

208
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,070
crowd I can say this is where Rick and I

209
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,350
want don't want to place two copies of

210
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,830
the same work so you choose no just are

211
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,549
not at the same way you can configure

212
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,690
the application and if you do wait and

213
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,559
it should be fast calculation

214
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,970
deterministic and it's evenly

215
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,789
distributed that were called so the

216
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:34,609
wander because that way we can benefit

217
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:44,200
from all notes so so far this cluster as

218
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,210
two kinds of not the first one all of

219
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,289
the objects storage device those we have

220
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:58,909
lots of those nodes demons tends to ten

221
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:59,690
thousands

222
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,269
I think they followed it out maybe but

223
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,509
[Music]

224
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:17,210
it's because we do occasionally know

225
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,489
we're going to do additional replication

226
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:24,830
in the storage layer and its main for

227
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,080
about a third object to the user it's

228
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,019
smart storage node that's mini that's

229
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,169
tearing and in case of a failure without

230
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,950
the other two dollars days after

231
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,690
community each other and we'll work with

232
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,809
coordinated that are all communal comes

233
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:50,379
it will be balanced the storage

234
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,720
[Music]

235
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
they are called of no diem is the

236
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,270
monitor notes verse says the old

237
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,809
clustering logic they maintained

238
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,380
improper memberships of noise default

239
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,330
monitors with an obstruction because

240
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,730
it's very notice that there is not

241
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,980
responding and it will notify the

242
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,679
monitors failure and then the monitor

243
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,000
will spirit to the otherwise doing and

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,210
when you add in our food same way we

245
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,190
have a small number of birds five so on

246
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,059
they do reach taxes

247
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,549
it doesn't step any Delta to the usual

248
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,970
just for the clock just remember ships

249
00:20:46,970 --> 00:21:01,309
they are cluster we want actually sorry

250
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:10,940
the group Redis and and it will need a

251
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,710
lot of performance and you are willing

252
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:20,299
to actually interact with actually some

253
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,950
user use the brothers because dining to

254
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,320
super party there will be Python I don't

255
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,240
remember

256
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,409
probably more and it's very cheap I it's

257
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:43,789
not the sweet web map so inside one

258
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,860
object you have a key value store and

259
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,710
you can use this to serve example the

260
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,200
first upstairs

261
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,450
the director-general map a rubber skirt

262
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,200
by the bucket index

263
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,690
is map its support atomic single object

264
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,480
operations you can update attributes and

265
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,330
keys and gautama see in our objective

266
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,380
one operation it has snapshots per

267
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,090
object its objective notable that mean

268
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,340
you can actually pass you overwrite

269
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,909
object and we will discuss clusters of

270
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,919
very similar to start procedures and a

271
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,940
database you can actually write code

272
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,350
that will run directly on the earth

273
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,620
given an object's changed truly strong

274
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,529
feature it allows lots of performance we

275
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:43,470
around the surface and we have a watch

276
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,000
naughty file server circle webiste an

277
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,010
object and when the object chains will

278
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,990
get a notification across the cluster

279
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,529
everyone ready says verification so it's

280
00:22:55,529 --> 00:23:31,799
a very strong API but it's okay plasmid

281
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,070
web self and as we already need to

282
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,720
replicate one another one can be the

283
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,269
bastard some case it's other cases thus

284
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:44,789
we a replica so we talk with each other

285
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:47,309
and they can be text with this folder

286
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,010
because to meet it up in chatter then if

287
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,639
they get all that they notify the

288
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:57,149
monitors and then the cluster start to

289
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:00,630
under that case so you need that do that

290
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,830
failed

291
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,710
- marketers help but then it's fall you

292
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,650
know all the bad open things need to be

293
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,980
replicated traverses so then they do it

294
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:34,230
automatically the side of the object

295
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,340
maximum size of objecting there are this

296
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,590
is for mega for mega would be it that's

297
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,320
a reverse apricots of yours develop

298
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,780
those for mega if the object is larger

299
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,139
than

300
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,970
no no yeah you need one to read yeah

301
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,809
- right you need food that's dope even

302
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,880
fit freeways you need free copies

303
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,909
without full-time with the preview radio

304
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:38,059
would need one copy yes many if that's

305
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:46,909
the same only high quality machines the

306
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:54,620
more you can do large-scale now we're

307
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,530
going to register that more about for

308
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,419
this paper which is the component in

309
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,250
fact that provides the crowd of the

310
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,620
search select always important for the

311
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,530
structure uses no borders to communicate

312
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,270
through the artists cluster so we have

313
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,809
discussed avoid these Americas and

314
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,510
that's where the work I'll start another

315
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,960
straightway is a service built on top of

316
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,830
that so weather is object storage so

317
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,039
that scale should be simple we can

318
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,460
actually start so it's not just to

319
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,970
provide the API and matching with the

320
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,970
API we have when we look at our

321
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,780
objective for abuse or a biscotti way or

322
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,440
crowd we see some difference so first is

323
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,250
the big five every object is four mega

324
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,620
and we talk in our cloud so we talk

325
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,500
about pretty large object so we need

326
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,650
somewhere

327
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,960
bigger objects and divided to those four

328
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,570
mega sized objects so what is objective

329
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,180
neutral ball-bearing cloud we talk about

330
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,140
immutable objects the hardest part is

331
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,990
that the poles inside of others are not

332
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,930
indexed but we want to list all the

333
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,210
objects in the bucket sorted by name

334
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,050
that means we need to add some indexing

335
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,380
for the bucket to allow those listing

336
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:41,130
and suppose like a bucket but we need a

337
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:51,210
sales per object so to implement the

338
00:27:51,210 --> 00:28:08,820
cloud the research top of it so in case

339
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,720
you see that you have lots of actions or

340
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,570
an equation and the audits way is

341
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,940
whether you can just one another

342
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,790
instance of water circulate on the same

343
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,420
set crafter and both can work together

344
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,100
and continue and that's why we can scale

345
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:38,400
up so again this is object storage we

346
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:50,430
have usual antennas with metadata which

347
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,490
is really complex because we support

348
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,190
several protocols to very support to our

349
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,850
private protocol as fluent switched in

350
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,180
many cases you can use back in the same

351
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,540
time

352

353
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,929
[Music]

354
00:29:41,250 --> 00:30:12,269
okay to allow that

355
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:19,840
and also if you have won the credit

356
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,029
application there's no reason that's

357
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:28,289
very basic stuff then you can use it but

358
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,690
so you try to be ready Scott very

359
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:49,570
possible that everyone can access all

360
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,289
the time

361
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,879
I'll go bit about those so first we have

362
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:58,419
the front-end content is not provide the

363
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:01,960
rest API actually so it's helped us we

364
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,070
need HTTP so today the forces the old

365
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,879
and under commanded way so we support

366
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,560
absolutely di

367
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,170
the party and the other web service

368
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,090
there in a snapIt remembered is because

369
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,660
Casa di is lots of security issues so

370
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,230
but some sometimes if you already have

371
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,770
your old Apache you handle the security

372
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,730
issue with a CGI it can be an option

373
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:37,500
today from hammer action I don't

374
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,130
remember

375
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,770
we have seen that web channel various

376
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,870
web server inside of the web escape way

377
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,430
we then we go to the west where it's

378
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,380
actually below that converts from the

379
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,570
dialect between the protocol so it

380
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,770
passes as free Swifton AR API then goes

381
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:42,680
to execution which we also

382
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:00,999
sometimes you need to abdicate again so

383
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:24,309
we support the OWS for about four to six

384
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:30,159
times so it will move to election in the

385
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,609
background

388
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,960
the bucket sorted by name but when we

389
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,060
talk about club ever spirits were

390
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,790
careful that one bucket contain millions

391
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,480
of objects and then the bucket in looks

392
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,790
is also a bottleneck for performance and

393
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,030
also because it's in the end starting

394
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,440
and all that weather subject if you pass

395
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,250
one object line it also inefficient so

396
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,680
first thing if you have lots of lateral

397
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,780
but the staff members up to rather okay

398
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,310
object with one bucket in it that's fine

399
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,890
if you have one more than one under case

400
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,370
then you need to use shaadi we track the

401
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,980
bucket in depth and split to several

402
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,210
object depending on the number of

403
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,580
objects you decide whenever of charge

404
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,760
you want we have that support for of

405
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:26,840
Seshadri and it's in and we're trying to

406
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,450
work on the elevation in battle you will

407
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,430
need to offering the bucket as the pilot

408
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:40,540
rate can do it with IO skip that

409
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,690
so I thought I'd be able to build system

410
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,590
object can be written for many many

411
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,730
places several rebus gateways we need

412
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,430
farewell to coordinate the quota so we

413
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:00,020
the subject plus objects to do that so

414
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,150
when you actually write objects

415
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,480
embarrass do we update the quarter the

416
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,850
thing the quota is not completely

417
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,310
consistent with something looks a bit

418
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,400
but I think resistance have the same

419
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,070
issue we dot we were the middle of the

420
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,980
class and we use watch notify 200 that

421
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,040
but mainly in case whether the change

422
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,900
the other were discovered retina

423
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,210
fication and then can involve that at

424
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,070
entry from the cache so notice so we

425
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,460
take in our cloud but cloud is never one

426
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,850
data center many times we want several

427
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,750
data centers anyone to a disaster

428
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,200
recovery you actually wanna use all of

429
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,950
them for that well notified of your

430
00:37:53,950 --> 00:38:00,490
application so you can take perfect

431
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:06,230
clusters and configure them and there

432
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,780
will be a super-racer professional rub

433
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,350
each other

434
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:18,279
it could be active operation which is

435
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,100
metadata alterations are suppose because

436
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,560
they are really important staff and we

437
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,400
cannot have a difference in those so we

438
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,930
have a mega master and in Calcifer CD to

439
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,030
do fell over and configure you make a

440
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,060
pastor but the data is completely a

441
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,640
secret that means all the different

442
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,530
the object and there will be replicated

443
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,110
or Tomatoes thematically to the aisle

444

00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,450
same that eyes a different object we

449

have a crucial occasion

450
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,850
thanks to Von Teese so the power cube

451
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,340
shape we have compassion also we want it

452
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,360
work with support and we have started

00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,340
website through anyone wants to use

454
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:38,990
static website which you can be exported

455
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:43,010
out our to elastic search and you can

456
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,580
search the metadata and we're working

457
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,279
about doing a linebacker to Charlotte
