1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,380
okay just

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,010
guess we should start my name is no god

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,460
I'm a software engineer at Oracle I work

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,510
on do your spatial data in MySQL and in

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,940
my school 5:7 we started really

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,390
improving the GIS support and we're

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,430
continuing in mice white mice called

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,570
five seven we were able to replace a lot

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,270
of the old we actually place the entire

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,190
computational engine for 4g is much

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,190
great we are extending the support so i

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,079
wanted to talk about next version my

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,129
scroll i I can't promise anything I know

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,710
what's what we want to do what we plan

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,089
to do but I can't really promise that

16
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,249
this will be in the final product or all

17
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:53,640
it I can say the generally some of this

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,999
will be in the product but kind we won't

19
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,069
delay the release a nice great because

20
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,429
we're missing a DRS function so if we

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,060
miss deadlines on that we can't will

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,020
deliver whatever we can so I'm going to

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,909
talk about about the goals for my school

24
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,329
AIDS or GIS in MySQL in general what we

25
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,130
will do in my school ates

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,990
how we will extend our support I'll talk

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,619
a bit about the choice of library for

28
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,130
for ghio computations say something

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,340
about our view on static compliance and

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,710
then this all boils down to a few

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,600
decisions around for instance access or

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,649
and data types so real chain is you will

33
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,170
see in a difference between MySQL and

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,259
some other systems because of these

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,700
principles I'll talk about first so our

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,090
goals ease of use we want Michael to be

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,630
easy to use one of those things is to

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,960
act to follow the standards another

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,909
thing is that it should be built-in not

40
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,009
like some other open source database

41
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,530
management systems that have TS as an

42
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,508
add-on this will be built in first-class

43
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,370
citizens it should be really easy to to

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,030
start using GS if you have G data you

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,860
don't need to add an extension just to

46
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,680
store your coordinates and you do

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,640
computations on them we are already the

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,940
most popular DBMS for web apps if you've

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,190
been to our stand down downstairs it

50
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,370
says five of the five most popular web

51
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,030
apps are using my scores on their ad and

52
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,260
web maps are the real new things so we

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,790
want to support that as well yeah you

54
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,069
already have a great market for web apps

55
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,250
we want web maps as well which means

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,090
global later this is not kind of

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,489
scientist sitting working on Norway for

58
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,320
instance they're working on these web

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,730
maps are global usually it means data

60
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,230
import and export that is suitable for

61
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,790
the web for instance Jason export and we

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,760
want to care for mobile devices I have

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,320
one here somewhere we all have GPSS well

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,989
some of these apps are now being backed

65
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,430
by web technologies so some of this

66
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,130
applies to web mobile devices as well

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,560
people start tracking where they go we

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,660
have people come to me to talk about

69
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,690
vehicle tracking in my school so we want

70
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,150
to cater for that as well maybe routing

71
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,150
at some points it's not on the bald knob

72
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,110
at moments but kind of supporting some

73
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,480
kind of a fleet tracking fleet

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,019
management thing is definitely something

75
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,160
we would like to see in my school so

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,410
what we'll do we will do geography

77
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,920
geography and geography my school 5 7

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,420
and earlier only supports Cartesian math

79
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,310
you can specify an S or D but like

80
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,480
post-race it will ignore it with the

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,269
jump types so we are adding the entire

82
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,010
framework for supporting spatial

83
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,550
reference systems it's already in the

84
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,310
first developer milestone of my slate

85
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,800
it's hidden in there we haven't talked

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
much about it because we haven't really

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,639
expose it to user Jets but the framework

88
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,310
is starting to appear and we are

89
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,530
planning to geographically enable as

90
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,300
many functions as possible we're not

91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,770
adding as many functions as possible we

92
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,990
are taking those functions we have for

93
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,020
cartesian data and starting to make them

94
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,180
work on geographical data longitudinal

95
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,830
attitude we are using boost geometry as

96
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,300
a library for for GIS and that means

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,740
that we first have add that

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,199
functionality to boost and then we can

99
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,389
start using in my school we prefer not

100
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,069
to add special mathematical functions to

101
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,289
MySQL we want Adam to boost first and

102
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,190
then we wait for boost to be released

103
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,830
and we will do some things to make the

104
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,529
upgrade easier because my school already

105
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,440
supports SR IDs but it doesn't

106
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,719
understand them so you can set an ester

107
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,729
ID that's geographical but it will still

108
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,860
do Cartesian computations this is kind

109
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,110
of an upgrade story for us that doesn't

110
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,409
look too good whistlin development we

111
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,449
can do a lot of things we really like

112
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,000
your feedback so we had a mouse on

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
release in September October there's one

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,440
coming up soon so I think in the next

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,860
one you'll see some of these GIS work so

116
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,690
test it and give us feedback we are

117
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,509
really looking for feedback on our

118
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:03,270
decisions and solutions so we had to

119
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,770
pick a library we did that in my school

120
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,659
5/7 we didn't want to maintain all this

121
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,879
alone we can help maintain it

122
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,710
sure but we don't want to do it alone we

123
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,650
want something that is there already

124
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,050
exist that we can expand on we're happy

125
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,529
to contribute we are maybe the single

126
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,449
biggest contributor to boost geometry at

127
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,229
moments we have the two next guys are

128
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:33,060
from Oracle as well they are working

129
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,099
with exclusively with extending boost

130
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,039
geometry and we're happy that they can

131
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,839
actually contribute that back instead of

132
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,990
doing only in my school we need a lot

133
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,850
before CC plus high schoolers

134
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,920
Plus us and we want something that holds

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,620
the OGC standards because we do that and

136
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,300
we want something that is kind of fits

137
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,300
with with that solution and we want one

138
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,160
library that handles Cartesian

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,390
accommodations and Geographic

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,570
computations we don't want to use two

141
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,730
different libraries and and adapted to

142
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,180
libraries because we have to adapt with

143
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,720
boost we have well there are properties

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,640
of that library that makes it that

145
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,030
requires changes in my scroll to - to

146
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,100
use the library for instance they're

147
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,560
very into type trades and that kind of

148
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,820
thing which means we actually have a

149
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,130
different point type for Cartesian and

150
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,560
one geographical data because it's a

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,600
trait of that data type which

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,500
computations you get so that affects

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,240
some of our design decisions in the

154
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,110
server we started with boost 155 a

155
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,590
couple years ago and we're upgrading

156
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,400
every version we're not one 163 in

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,320
development but as soon as we release so

158
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,610
my second five seven is the stable

159
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,940
release we froze that on boost 159 so

160
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,580
boost geometry is I had wrong the

161
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,080
library so it's compiling there's no

162
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,210
runtime linking at all so the reason

163
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,550
freeze is that we are doing so much work

164
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,640
contributing new stuff that we can't

165
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,430
really upgrade and have a stable

166
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,640
behavior of that magical version so we

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,950
we need to freeze to be sure that we

168
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,770
have the same behavior that means that

169
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,660
we have to maintain some patches in case

170
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,120
you find bugs that we need fix we will

171
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,080
have to make patches for for boosts or

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,830
separate header files to work around

173
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,840
these issues so we both extend boost and

174
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,120
we do some patching if we find the need

175
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,680
for that in our release so my school 5/7

176
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,850
was released and was it two years ago or

177
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,770
something and we're going to support

178
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,400
that for I guess until like eight years

179
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,150
so this

180
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,589
why number of years to support one boost

181
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,720
version but we only have the support of

182
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,240
personality that we are using so we have

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,970
to bug fix that we want to be Santa

184
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,370
client as close as possible to these

185
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,230
centers but they disagree a bit

186
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,080
sometimes some things are not well

187
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,529
defined we spend quite quite some time

188
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,120
digging these designs trying to figure

189
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,880
out exactly what does this mean

190
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,410
something is just stupid if you look at

191
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,570
gear Jason the RFC that came out the

192
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,820
interpretation of a line segment that's

193
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,910
just stupid it's it's not the shortest

194
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,070
line it has to be on the globe but it's

195
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,350
a linear interpolation in the Cartesian

196
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,390
system it just doesn't make sense

197
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,890
so we decided not do that and the

198
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,720
standards are usually object-oriented

199
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,910
like you would see in my school seek in

200
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,390
Microsoft sequel server but MySQL and

201
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,520
positives are not so we have different

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,820
dialect to things and some things are

203
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,220
not standardized the SQL standards care

204
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,190
about how you insert update delete and

205
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,459
queer data but it has nothing to say

206
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,959
about how you create a spatial reference

207
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,760
system how create your own how do you

208
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,420
find it that's not defined at all so

209
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,520
that's something we have to make up or

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,100
look at how our competitors are doing it

211
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,000
and copy them this is where we are we're

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,360
at fifty point eight one and four point

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,339
38 which means we are in Brussels or

214
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,220
outside the coast of Somalia it depends

215
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,770
on whether it's latitude longitude or

216
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,550
longitude latitude I had beer here and

217
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,400
not Indian Ocean waters so I think we're

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,970
in Brussels but this has been argued for

219
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,150
a long time and we want to be signed a

220
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,820
compliant and this is what the OGC said

221
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,270
nine years ago

222
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,950
going forward always followed the order

223
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,020
of axis specified in spatial reference

224
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,420
system so my school uses the EPS D

225
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,740
datasets

226
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,760
we currently import like almost 5,000

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,330
kroner systems from from that that's all

228
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,190
the types that we support there's also

229
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,970
either projections or 2d geographical

230
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,710
systems and EPS V uses latitude

231
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,380
longitude which means my school is

232
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,460
latitude longitude

233
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,550
I remember Microsoft tried to use

234
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,700
latitude longitude when I add a GI

235
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,510
support they had so much complaints that

236
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,580
they backed out of it and switch to long

237
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,330
as you'd like it

238
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,500
so here we go again I know pass basis is

239
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,190
Lange longitude latitude always but we

240
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,500
have something that Microsoft didn't

241
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,120
have we have extended the Sun a little

242
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,460
bit we allow for a separate parameter

243
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,500
where you can say that my data is

244
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,120
longitude latitude no matter what this

245
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,450
this epsg code says this is longitude

246
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,580
latitude for this import for this export

247
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,860
use longitude latitude you can override

248
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,940
the defaults that is for all our systems

249
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,350
largely longitude if you create your own

250
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,240
you can create a long large in system no

251
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,550
problem but all those that come with my

252
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,180
school are largely longitude so we

253
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,830
believe that the best thing is to follow

254
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,240
the standards and this is where it led

255
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,280
us maybe not what we expected but that's

256
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,330
the way it turned out on the other hand

257
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,580
we store it as long as you latitude but

258
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,350
that's on its own so from it don't care

259
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,890
about that

260
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,750
that's a historical decision and

261
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,050
probably good one I don't complain about

262
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,890
that but this is for import-export how

263
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,540
we stored internally doesn't matter to

264
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,210
our users this is just something we need

265
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,310
to do but it matters in the upgrade we

266
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,590
have coming but but not for for the user

267
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,500
of all moscow nuts after the upgrade at

268
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,140
least another decision we made because

269
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,230
of the standards is that we use the same

270
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,160
data types for cartesian and geographic

271
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,820
data so it's GM from texts both for as

272
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,270
right

273
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,800
zero which is kind of the abstract

274
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,280
infinite plane and for geographical data

275
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,100
in in wgs84 so if you come from postage

276
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,320
world you see GOG from text here because

277
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,140
geometry and geography are different

278
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,120
things in in some systems but not in my

279
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,620
school because this is the standard

280
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,090
compliant way of doing it this is what

281
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,650
the oldest he has said all the way so

282
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,160
cartesian between kind of this is

283
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,070
latitude longitude and it's in cartesian

284
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,600
so it doesn't really make sense the

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,540
output you have but the this is actually

286
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,070
run on on my working tree for for

287
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,210
geographical distance so this actually

288
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,490
soft mat my school will hopefully

289
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,150
provide when i'm allowed to push that

290
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,640
but of course you can query my school to

291
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,470
do to think spiritually for instance so

292
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,240
even if it's a sorry to 0 we have

293
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,370
functions that will curse this into

294
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,870
being a geographical computation the

295
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,370
reason these are different is that the

296
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,620
default this is a sphere this is

297
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:44,620
spheroid but yeah so we had we are made

298
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,670
some decisions

299
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,420
the vein wants to hold the standards and

300
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,240
to use boost that led us to having

301
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,080
internal struck with differences between

302
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,310
geographical and Cartesian data but

303
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,680
because of standards we try to merge it

304
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
and and present it as as one data type

305
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,800
to the user but then you have these

306
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,780
decisions and these consequences lead to

307
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,280
the interesting upgrade story we're

308
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,230
upgrading from the previous my scroll to

309
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,510
the current to the next - call it's

310
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,510
going to be interesting if you use

311
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,940
something else than s or ad 0 because

312
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,330
you might be saying that i have largely

313
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,150
longitude or long as latitude data but

314
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,040
your computations in in the previous

315
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
module where cartesian anyways

316
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,290
so we'll have some interesting effects

317
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,170
they're also the latitude/longitude

318
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,960
longitude/latitude swept it sport

319
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,060
swapping that was introduced is

320
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,340
introduced in my school eights so the

321
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,750
old my school doesn't really understand

322
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,860
what you're doing so that will it will

323
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,850
all say X first then Y so you will

324
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,340
always in in all my school

325
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,430
you were always so longitude first which

326
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,780
means you have to change your

327
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,420
import/export statements when upgrading

328
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,600
so this is going to be fun all these

329
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
users changing the data and the queries

330
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,580
at the same time as they are operating

331
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,740
but we are trying to prepare users by

332
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,540
saying switch so as already zero now

333
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,100
because that's actually what you're

334
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,140
doing whatever you claim you're doing

335
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,580
today with long as you nodded your you

336
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,850
not its Cartesian so just tell my school

337
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,320
let you bring that and everything will

338
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,640
be the same when you upgrade would

339
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,390
simply wrong so yeah that's kind of

340
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,600
perhaps one of the most interesting

341
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,040
conclusions we arrived at when when

342
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,650
starting on this that we will going to

343
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,870
breaks quite a few things when when

344
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,180
upgrading so this is still ongoing

345
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,600
I showed you some work on distance

346
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,890
between geographical points hope that

347
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,890
can get in we are have all the other

348
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,020
functions we need to do graphic B enable

349
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,670
as well but we will talk about this as

350
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,060
it happens we will try to announce as

351
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,040
much as possible because this is that

352
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,900
this will break things so will try to be

353
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,839
very active on on telling users this is

354
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,339
what we're doing this is how you should

355
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,480
prepare now to be forward compatible and

356
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,290
I have a feeling that in the end we will

357
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,870
be more standard compatible than the

358
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,800
alternatives which is an interesting

359
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,170
thing to see that my school suddenly the

360
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,100
most standard compliant one but it helps

361
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,830
sometimes to to come late to the party

362
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,910
because all the other ones have made the

363
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,080
mistakes and you can learn from them

364
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,419
so I do have time for a few questions

365
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,370
before next one I setup we have three

366
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,490
sessions with with no break between so I

367
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,820
can take I think a few questions before

368
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:22,380
we continue if Ronnie yeah so yeah

369
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,780
you're from the evil side or the good

370
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,900
side from Posterous the other side yeah

371
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,950
so you're asking a about performance we

372
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,650
don't have any performance numbers yet

373
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,289
this is still in development so I

374
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:40,020
haven't really gotten around to doing

375
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,620
that but I guess we'll start seeing it

376
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,210
when when we actually release a

377
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,760
development version that can someone

378
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,140
that has two eyes functionality that

379
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,179
people will start comparing it it will

380
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,600
be interesting to see and also I think

381
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,780
we could look at correctness I think

382
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,110
I've seen a few things in imposters that

383
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,200
looks a bit weird in computations so the

384
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,179
double things we saw that when operating

385
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,950
to from five six two five seven that

386
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,409
people complain oh it's so much slower

387
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:15,090
but then we said yeah but now we get

388
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,650
correct answer so what do you want so

389
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,500
but but the matter of accuracy versus

390
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,210
speed that is definitely a thing we

391
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,610
think about and we may have at the

392
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,090
moment

393
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,270
fail on the side of being too accurate

394
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,740
and too slow

395
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,690
maybe in our relation we can adjust that

396
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,789
afterwards whose is really flexible on

397
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,470
that we have who's developers here they

398
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,539
know that we can adjust the strategies

399
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:46,700
and and the algorithms quickly okay yeah

400
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,160
estimates regarding ga-oh my scroll so

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,860
notice a release well I think it's been

402
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,559
like two years since the previous one so

403
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,980
we typically release two or three years

404
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,900
off his previous one so so yeah it's

405
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,240
it's forthcoming I don't have a date yet

406
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:15,130
I'm sorry yes could be a hint yeah

407
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,070
special indexes are not yet from boost

408
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,840
no our special indices are our homegrown

409
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,409
or trees I don't think there are plans

410
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,360
to you or I know there aren't aren't any

411
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,760
plans to replace that I'm not sure we

412
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:42,530
could I'm not sure if the the boost our

413
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,539
trees would would work in that setting

414
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,210
because it's so ingrained into nodb and

415
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,309
the way in DB works so it's it's more

416
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,740
similar to energy BB three stand to

417
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,220
boost our trees I think we have to do it

418
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,080
the next one offline because I'm one

419
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,850
minute over my time here okay we are

420
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,390
focusing on you know the DB only my item

421
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,539
is seems to be dying that's just a hint

422
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,890
okay thank you

423
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,209
[Applause]
