1
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,600
so one of the things that I consider

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,360
myself is an open-source aficionado I do

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,400
a few things at various open source

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,300
communities

5
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,180
I'm also an IT student from Rochester

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,630
New York

7
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm involved with a free and open source

8
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,949
software initiative there and I'm also a

9
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,810
fedora contributor and some of the

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,729
things that I do the Dorner magazine

11
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,649
editor energy will be team native the

12
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,810
community operations team and a

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,909
marketing team member ambassador and

14
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,159
there's a few other things I can don't

15
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,950
want to talk about but what I really do

16
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,350
into the Dora take away all the titles

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,509
the kind of work that I'm doing is in

18
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,880
mostly non-technical field in a very

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,119
technical project and the best way I

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,819
kind of describe that is I came into the

21
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,889
open-source community in a very deep way

22
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,719
where I didn't really come in doing the

23
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,819
technical contributions and I kind of

24
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,320
look

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,470
firstly the community side of fedoras

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,040
and I think the best way to describe and

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,920
what I do is I'm kind of discovering and

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,140
contributing in this never-ending novel

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,530
of what is the Dora what are the goals

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,380
and objectives that we're trying to do

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,369
I'll get to that

32
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,130
so was the top Kaiser just collect baby

33
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,810
like let's live what's the connection

34
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,540
here it is their magic and open source

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,979
is that where it is but it's not exactly

36
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,250
so

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,489
JK Rowling has a very comedic ability of

38
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,489
telling stories she has a way where she

39
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,830
can captivate people with her books with

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,420
her always ready for the next chapter

41
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,310
and they're always looking to paint

42
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,930
because they want to know what's next

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,910
what the next what the next part of the

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,739
story and it's a patron so a lot of work

45
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,680
isn't just unique to literature it's

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,110
uncommon but it's vital for technical

47
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,880
work and I think especially for open

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,230
source communities but how exactly is

49
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,720
storytelling of our development doors so

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,610
in a world of code and connects the

51
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,920
software where does storytelling really

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,610
fit in and the objective here is that

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,739
every piece of software that we work on

54
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,990
is meeting a goal or

55
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,480
phrasing scratching an inch when you sat

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
down to weaken Sydney to some kind of

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
software or work on a project or start a

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,500
project you had it mean that you wanted

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,960
to stall you had an objective that you

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,900
knew that something else wasn't quite

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,430
there or you thought you could do it

62
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,610
yourself so your software is committed

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,730
to solving a specific need or specific

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,210
set of needs so the idea is that

65
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,160
storytelling fits into open source

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,110
because you have to communicate what

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,350
kind of unique problems your software is

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,080
trying to solve with both your users but

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,980
also your contributor community so why

70
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,410
are you have two different audiences

71
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,440
that you're communicating the story of

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
the open source project for users is

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,120
pretty straightforward your users want

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,740
to know about what your software does

75
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,780
they want to know how I can solve their

76
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,880
problems and you as the project

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,550
maintainer or community help communicate

78
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,830
that and persuade this pretentious that

79
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,140
of users about why their software is the

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,840
best solution or the best one to use or

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,420
whatever problems are trying to address

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,590
so that one is kind of a little

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,810
intuitive but for contributors by a

84
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,070
storytelling important for your

85
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,620
contributor to it's important because

86
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,019
it's difficult to know multiple sides of

87
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,940
a community without being in all these

88
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,399
different places at the same time that's

89
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,140
definitely a little bit true for larger

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,880
open source

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,370
like Linux distributions and the

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,080
important step is we need to try to have

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,000
everyone on the same page so we have

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,980
these different teams or maybe the

95
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,320
groups working on different tasks so at

96
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,700
the end of the day they're all working

97
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,530
towards the same end objective you're

98
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,180
all reaching here in the same project

99
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,560
community working towards the same

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,320
general goals every one of the same page

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,580
about what's happening in these

102
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,160
different parts of the community the

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,900
best way I can describe it is you have

104
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,460
two houses next to each other a

105
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,960
neighborhood the neighborhood is your

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,370
open source project and it's like

107
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,470
opening the window better communicate

108
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,000
with the people who are in community

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,610
with your neighbors then a really great

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,930
example I think of this that we've

111
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,670
recently done into the Dora and we have

112
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,250
the Fedora love's Python campaign for

113
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,870
the you service it's a very it's kind of

114
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,760
an easy way to describing how we're

115
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,530
telling story because we're trying to

116
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,330
target the Python community and show

117
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,130
them why Fedora is great for the

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,750
battling with Python and why do you

119
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:24,620
target sin means the distribution for we

120
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,480
started this get started in the

121
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,410
marketing and operations and give up how

122
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,210
to proceed with this one forward and

123
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,770
then we reached out through the Python

124
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,810
see about what they thought was

125
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,860
something that we would want to

126
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,000
highlight for and it wasn't just like a

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,950
we're going to ask you why should we get

128
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,830
an answer and we're going to work on

129
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,720
this idea more there's a very constant

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,330
communication was very happy it wasn't

131
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,140
like we were going back and forth

132
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,320
was an active part of this and then once

133
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,000
you have the ideas who went into design

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,650
team to work on things like a brochure

135
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,140
and and like the design my teacher

136
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,390
stickers and heat for that process we

137
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,220
kind of Python developers and the

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,440
marketing Nina from very active and

139
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,470
engaging the entire process so it wasn't

140
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,030
just like the design team is doing and

141
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,480
everything

142
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,670
the architect even doing anything in the

143
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,070
Python community will absolutely need it

144
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,950
was a very active and a navy process of

145
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
all the different groups and in the

146
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,480
reason why I was successful was because

147
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,800
communication for the entire process was

148
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,350
very open and transparent when we

149
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,330
started the process marketing we

150
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,740
immediately reached out and tried to

151
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,450
involve and engage the Python community

152
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,660
about this entire campaign and finding

153
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,640
getting their input on it wasn't like we

154
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,950
surprised them with it Mihai or you do

155
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,380
this and one for the photos this is an

156
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,300
idea that we want to work together on we

157
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,000
wanted to buy invest so we can I don't

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,820
know what our project is doing well and

159
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,550
how we can share that with our users so

160
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,130
not way Tori Kelly is very important for

161
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,380
your users you know maybe why I want to

162
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,730
meet your software but also your

163
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,010
contributors so they know what is

164
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,750
happening to the Parsi community so how

165
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,940
he tell is open sort of story in your

166
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,090
own community the second way of saying

167
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,580
is there's a using the best practices

168
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,520
and using certain tools can help better

169
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,980
extract the story improve visibility of

170
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,870
various parts of your project community

171
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,930
and fair 180 be looking for some kind

172
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,360
like a secret tool tool or a ground

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,699
that's when you saw all the needs of

174
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,289
your project to make your contributor

175
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:37,169
community pride and do better the desert

176
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,400
is no see there's no big secret tool or

177
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,280
method rather it's using the things you

178
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,680
already have to go to maximum potential

179
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,020
and this is a set of ideas I have a few

180
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,419
examples that are ordered problem least

181
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,310
frequent that you want to use to the

182
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,439
most regions but it is not the manager

183
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,530
of the portals so firstly the reason

184
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,449
your project overview depending on your

185
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,150
project size is the front door and the

186
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,400
first impression you may find users and

187
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,990
it's the first everything for anyone

188
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,610
that comes in your body together they

189
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,460
want to know about what the project is

190
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,020
smaller the project on capability read

191
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,479
me and I was trying to see what the that

192
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,310
you're trying to do or what is your top

193
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,599
I would love this software I want to try

194
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,710
to do something to make it better

195
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,620
because I have this idea you need to

196
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,159
help provide them away seven stepping

197
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,620
stones to get to the place that you know

198
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,589
you need to arrive so in the regard for

199
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,240
users who want to most clearly

200
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,390
communicate what your project objectives

201
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,269
is are and how to solve them you want to

202
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,579
make it clear why your project is the

203
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,170
best solution and for whatever you're

204
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,199
doing for a solid project you read mean

205
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,670
if they give you clear like what is it

206
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,740
software what are you trying to do what

207
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,890
they suspected for the purpose of your

208
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,370
goals and also you want to include how

209
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,110
to get involved like tickets and

210
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,740
in a minute about ideas that you want to

211
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,290
communicate and then the larger projects

212
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,480
like which pain or that it's an overview

213
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,370
of your project like an epidural kind of

214
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,860
a an overview of the Tor project your

215
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,620
wiki that goes into things like what is

216
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,370
this fedora

217
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,649
what acid or Linux and what is our

218
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,760
community one of what are all the

219
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,440
different parts of the Fedora community

220
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,510
and what their government is one of

221
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,760
those blank but also how doing the sort

222
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,589
of project which then leaves due to

223
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,060
various some of the resources that we

224
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,970
have in projects of community if you

225
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,290
think you need your members you have one

226
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,660
shot so maybe come and you can

227
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,390
prioritize the integration watch and

228
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,519
yosity of organized we don't want to

229
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,260
overwhelm them with too much information

230
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,970
because then another suppose page

231
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,709
hierarch is what's most important things

232
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,320
to include in your in here your front

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,779
door your project it makes you organize

234
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,870
it in a way that makes sense

235
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,850
so another 22news announcement of

236
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,579
Manliness for negative item size but

237
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,410
it's understandable where I've seen too

238
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,810
many emails to announce the project list

239
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,880
but the thing that I also see sometimes

240
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,910
that people are afraid easy because we

241
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,940
don't want to send too many emails to

242
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,800
the private goodnight to the people who

243
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,050
are on live which is understandable but

244
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,140
keep in mind that these people have

245
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,300
absolutely made the choice to subscribe

246
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,110
to your announcements and they wanted to

247
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,620
be included

248
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,280
[Music]

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,179
[Music]

250
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,750
and thanks for the Mars project is

251
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,100
really key to centralise where

252
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,500
contributors are writing their like

253
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,630
updates on projects it's a larger

254
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,150
community sometimes we use planets for

255
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,390
me to install a lot of post or planet

256
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,940
where anyone who's into Jupiter can take

257
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,800
their blog up and then their blog post

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,839
and planet sometimes it was really

259
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,510
awesome posts on there that is writing

260
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,010
so many amazing things that are

261
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,630
happening in just one part of the newer

262
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,040
that you would never realize

263
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,170
let's read under bottommost sometimes

264
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,820
it's already about how someone learned

265
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,640
to swim over the summer it's not really

266
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,820
relevant at the private community but

267
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,260
that they have we tried doing in Sonora

268
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,750
around number 2015 was begin initiatives

269
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,959
or even any law and this is a tiny yeah

270
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,150
you give - you want to know what's

271
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,650
happening in the Fedora providers your

272
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,330
community you can go to the community

273
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,880
wall and you can see what's happening in

274
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,770
fedoras saying what's happening for this

275
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,750
week and if you disorder by category

276
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,100
installers ever dissever project

277
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,180
documentation

278
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,540
many operations design development the

279
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,810
Fedora Council so

280
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,960
and probably not is that there's no need

281
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,880
to fight a navigator this senior

282
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,890
contributor applause to figure out

283
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,600
what's really going on in your project

284
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
community so people who are active in

285
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,460
your private in the community can't go

286
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,140
here and see what's going on these are

287
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,060
part of a community and people who are

288
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,550
teachers or just in your community they

289
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,130
came into the project by going here in

290
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,080
seeing the convoy I'm kind of interested

291
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,970
in the design team I want to get

292
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,590
involved with design what's going on

293
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,520
here

294
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,120
for smaller project so if you're just a

295
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,830
story or maybe it's a small handful of

296
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,840
very active contributors we should have

297
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,460
solid eight and know where you're

298
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,970
writing constant or small project you

299
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,620
might have it here and read me or the

300
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,390
private overview about here's where

301
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,300
we're writing posts about privately the

302
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,580
project in you can follow here to figure

303
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,100
out what's going on so on and so forth

304
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,230
but the key thing here and then it

305
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,060
shouldn't become too much to absorb

306
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,250
you want to go to sort of sweet and

307
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,080
instead of going long and then you're

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,470
writing a thousand words so you need it

309
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,270
actually ends up story month by another

310
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,890
two people were actually reading your

311
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,350
articles when there's a shorter anymore

312
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,400
to the point

313
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,890
so the general the importance of writing

314
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,510
blog is you're trying to communicate

315
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,100
what's happening you've invited the

316
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,250
community and a larger more rod moment

317
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,920
announcements quite frequently this is I

318
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,449
mean people are really actually

319
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,560
so it's a really great way to

320
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,600
communicate these bigger ideas like

321
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,920
maybe you're having Maya so you're

322
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,770
working for it so you want to play a

323
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,399
monthly update you want these issues

324
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,560
about sucked here or we have these

325
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,029
really cool things that are coming into

326
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,890
your future and wanted to promote better

327
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,800
and the next release of the software or

328
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,760
the idea is it right hand logging with

329
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,430
really great way to give people a better

330
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,110
insight into some of the development of

331
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,360
the project and better understand what's

332
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,610
happening in the community so for a

333
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,160
larger project that makes sense to be

334
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,750
centralized and have a single place off

335
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,730
of the site information for a smaller

336
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,980
project just more clearly communicate

337
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,850
where people can go for news or updates

338
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,810
privately and lastly lastly think about

339
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,630
social media so it's supposed to be

340
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,459
short sweet to the point if you've been

341
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,140
doing something sweet in your project

342
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,890
plate you work for this issue and post

343
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,660
something so people are engaged if you

344
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,040
want to social media to console your

345
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,140
project if you have one can follow you

346
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,880
that way it doesn't have to be something

347
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,790
it's like okay sit down and write a

348
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,310
tweet 140 characters we did something

349
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,470
you want to sleep put anything does that

350
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,970
way people we can see that your private

351
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,740
exactly there's things happening in your

352
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,720
private community you don't have to try

353
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,430
to figure out like how do i do you make

354
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,589
of these really cool things that we're

355
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,750
doing more visible just do these smaller

356
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,150
things and people who are interested you

357
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,770
know they're probably out

358
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,060
I don't know whether there really got to

359
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,180
do great old to be in DC and he wanted

360
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,950
to meet or even in for a very harder

361
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,399
private out to idiot name but that's a

362
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,050
really great way people to see that your

363
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,339
project was moving in these are

364
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,440
happening and they Diwali one of those

365
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,240
last forms and it's very very way to

366
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,089
engage with again either current

367
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:38,720
executors

368
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
for a larger project might not have an

369
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,290
idea what's happening needs to be

370
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,450
written silently project but also people

371
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,089
more interested in using or contributing

372
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,330
to your software so once you do all of

373
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,700
these things how do you make efforts

374
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,470
like how do you make me actually if I

375
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,910
really put in all this work that I've

376
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,920
been doing how do I know what is pain

377
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,720
like what's the how do we know is

378
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,510
actuality didn't have so I want to give

379
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,429
a specific example of what we have in

380
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,230
store which is this really cool thing

381
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,679
called fed back messages tiny it's a

382
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,470
it's a big bus that emits a notification

383
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,119
every animal being every time you submit

384
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:26,240
to a package posit or a bill later and

385
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,760
some label run say in the comments acid

386
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,890
or questions that it's all on and it is

387
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,160
just really good way to kind of see what

388
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
is happening in this module resume this

389
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,580
exact second and you've read over the

390
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,590
channel but they already have a message

391
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,300
which is just kind of like that aspire

392
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,760
knows of all these notifications all the

393
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,320
ones and if you don't they don't need to

394
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,410
get in your channel your file

395
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,460
so tell hundreds of mine just how many

396
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,860
coming up a meter how do I create or

397
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,800
interpret this but the way that ace is

398
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,230
really cold is when we more fighting a

399
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,420
little down what we're looking at we

400
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,910
don't for it into making connections

401
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,680
with certain things that we're doing in

402
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,470
the private equity and we make a

403
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,860
comparison do we have a really good

404
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,140
example that has for Fossum being

405
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,020
relevant there was really in case that a

406
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,650
distributor or any tactical door at

407
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,520
awesome

408
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,460
so the idea was we haven't moved out of

409
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,080
our communities and every year there's

410
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,540
bags to be able to clean - and you were

411
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,300
previously so these people were thinking

412
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,960
about do they do anything I got really

413
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,990
do anything what impact are we doing

414
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,870
anything that's worth highlighting and

415
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,030
like one thing I looked at was like

416
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,230
who's saying hello to us for the first

417
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,120
time who are people who are any out of

418
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,100
the door at home and you can just sign

419
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,120
up the weekend bottle and this one you

420
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,130
see that we have for the most part is

421
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,200
people reading on the fedora now who are

422
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,670
they active contributors complaining

423
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:58,970
about

424
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,310
but in to the door attractive find it

425
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,250
and then I don't think it important in

426
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,810
the Praetorian I'm involved it's not

427
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,990
worth it for us to pay travel travel

428
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,600
here's all the conclusions of the data

429
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,889
was well

430
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,600
18 2014 18 of them increase and their

431
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,179
monitoring activity after balsam and

432
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,280
they jumped up into a higher activity

433
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,130
group in a six-month period and looked

434
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,370
at before and after false making those

435
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,799
people starting to do anymore and a long

436
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
term view after the offset and then it

437
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,289
was three back to the decrease and that

438
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,809
message is a really amazing way for us

439
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:53,150
to better understand my positive

440
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,010
community to see whatever we do at the

441
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,260
moment it doesn't is exclusive to event

442
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,090
to see whether there's things like tying

443
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,460
the promotes translation games where we

444
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,960
might have caught those on the Fedora

445
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,940
community blog about hey where do we

446
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,100
kind of the translation spring you want

447
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,090
me to help out

448
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,220
we can try it'll bring the Fed message

449
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,380
and we're seeing for translations and in

450
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,360
correspondence to the promotion and

451
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,429
marketing or or what we're doing to try

452
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,409
and make it a bit more visible to the

453
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,230
wider community so it really is rate of

454
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:30,380
happiness and they're saying is it goes

455
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,090
much deeper than any time problem but so

456
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,500
how do you lead results if you don't

457
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,659
have something like that not everyone is

458
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:41,750
so lucky to have what have something

459
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,870
fancy but there's still patterns that

460
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,240
you can use to understand your subsets

461
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,880
so the penny on what kind of resources

462
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,890
you have in your private community if

463
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,659
you're trying to promote like this is it

464
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,039
an issue where you've got to send us

465
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,720
something you're trying to mange or

466
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
contributors or wider audience you can

467
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,059
try to manage the Commission issues for

468
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,320
requests that are coming into your

469
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,939
repository or Santa

470
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,750
a mostly Romanian project see if there's

471
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,640
an increase in the number of calibrate

472
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,430
ranges under on your councils of your

473
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,630
project for conference and medication

474
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,880
see if there's an increase in the number

475
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,190
of issues before quest after you have a

476
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,270
precedent you can also have a

477
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,210
localization see if there's increase the

478
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,400
number of transmitted streams or a new

479
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,460
language started appearing for it

480
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,340
actually but the point is that even if

481
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,000
you don't have a lot of advanced tools

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,370
you can still cut it down to something

483
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,940
it's very simple and it's really in the

484
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,870
universal in any open source project and

485
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,820
look at a more simple way you can you

486
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,560
try and make you some clues on your own

487
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,940
regardless of what resources the tools

488
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,620
but the way there is soaring or private

489
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,470
and community one person saw world

490

authority and

494
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
