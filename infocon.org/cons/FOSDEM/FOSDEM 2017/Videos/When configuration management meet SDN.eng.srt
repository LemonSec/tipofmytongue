I like to refer to as well so it is in

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,430
Seville and to build its own

4
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,470
orchestration tool position can be used

5
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,910
by a network engineer or anything or any

6
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,330

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:47,330
using SSH to just clean you want to shut

10
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,620
down production

11
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,400
you just type that and that's it because

12

[Music]

13
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,380
sometimes just one code is not enough

14
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,459
sometimes itself I mean

15
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,020

that's different because it's nice

19
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,590
description sir ginger I know people are

20
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,900
using Python but gingers you can play

21
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,439
King wrong with one out of completing

22
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,419
words in Python this is a national

23
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,909
support for Python code l5 for

24
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,840
expression and everything because just

25
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,370
adding step one by one is not

26
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:26,309

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,620
it's actually like your own Cisco

37
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,280
switches we decided to go to Japan

38

[Music]

45
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,740
because that's quite complete because

46
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,930
the one I plan to read later and I'm

47
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,490
sysadmin if I need to read documentation

48
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,340
so I think it has to be answer useful

49
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,920
later so I can spend more time on IRC

50
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,870
and discussing about systems in the

51
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,230
Quran

52
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,919
[Music]

53
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:52,649
to connect to anything and write on a

54
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,610
paper and that's it

55
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,759
since the last slide is running the

56
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,319
switching so you still need to execute

57
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:16,679
interface when you go to config file

58
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,779
it's something a line oriented so you

59
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,490
can say well for that configuration I

60
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,209
want to get from camp no DHCP for that

61
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,709
switches I want to go to DHCP snooping

62
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,449
on that port and everything so part is

63
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,740
quite interesting because suddenly you

64
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,290
can read some confusion in one part of

65
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,329
the playbook some confusion in the park

66
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,759
without fixing if you don't look like

67
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,370
this because I want to convert anything

68
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,170
there is another solution which is using

69
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,509
a template you just give a template file

70
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,080
you want wizard ginger if it's

71
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,540
for people to use it should be a

72
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,380
Louisiana for

73
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,660
something sometimes they do stand-up

74
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,210
which is a line and template for example

75
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,390
for journals and I've made Biogen is not

76
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,880
yet back up completely you can come back

77
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,010
at the previous step which is again I

78
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,190
mean make mistake but some people do so

79
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,690
it's for them to do more than just

80
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,940
getting faults and configure step such

81
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,290
as executing code

82
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,590
so as an ending surprise execute command

83
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,230
and returns output I don't want to know

84
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,310
what is the current status of

85
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,410
disconnecting like this well you can use

86
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:06,040
that it's interface I want to it's that

87
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,850
sort of command that's it you get three

88
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,010
that you need to pass by yourself and

89
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,380
that's why we start to regret using

90
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,490
unstable and not a Python script now if

91
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,240
you want to get more is a service model

92
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,500
each of them are specific to each family

93
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,640
so they're Israel

97
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,149
[Music]

98
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:44,439
I think the network you just want to

99
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:55,119
have one single operation in which and

100
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,790
have to pay for open second one thousand

101
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,829
people needed to maintain you can do and

102
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:08,489
I think that question you can ask

103
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,369
[Music]

104
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:36,070
and again if you approach and I decide

105
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,660
to approach friend for 10 minutes it's

106
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:54,150
good for yes

107
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,800
yeah so the question is on three buddies

108
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,760
using SSH what else is a possibility so

109
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,089
this for example you can connect using

110
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,899
the funk which is a method which is a

111
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,790
remote execution tool you can use a salt

112
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,250
so a system where you can connect using

113
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,560
a stage foot it's not SSH

114
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,839
it's a connecting locally but um it's

115
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,190
kind of the same you can actually get a

116
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,920
route you can connect to the car image

117
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,080
there is something to use our guest fish

118
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,540
to connect to a VM which is not running

119
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,850
there is no J's that it would be fun but

120
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,800
I could not find internet server to test

121
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,050
it but yeah you can

122
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,300
[Applause]

123
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,670
but they need simple done for people to

124
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,190
know that there is a rock and I get that

125
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,400
rock

126
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,230
or whatever the connection were using

127
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,329
that can just send our command get out

128
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,650
yeah so it's not a question but I would

129
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,760
sit with it so no gentlemen just at the

130
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,710
first row said that you can also use a

131
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,350
model called Rho which basically to

132
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,120
execute command without title

133
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,580
I did use that for talking stuff and

134
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,339
methods it was using on Sybil to do a to

135
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,010
jump post and then starting to agree put

136
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,470
something on the table so we can also do

137
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,810
that but then it's equivalent to using

138
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,830
expect which is not very algorithm I

139
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,670
should have done that it should have

140
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,230
been like one or two side more but

141
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,520
question I'm trying to

142
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,398
[Music]

143
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
because

144
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,839
[Music]

145
00:17:39,230 --> 00:18:06,840
you can to the to config that is using

146
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,450
patent and NC clients and come on the

147
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,330
client-side its own ansible ducks

148
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,690
[Music]

149
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,740
which I don't

150
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,010
[Music]

151
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,870
so the question is at what scale can we

152
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:58,240
use that it's a good question I'm not

153
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,100
planning to use that at a large scale

154
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,410
because my job is mostly maintaining a

155
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,440
lot of small project I know that I found

156
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,260
them on network stuff there is web space

157
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,510
managing that world cloud using unstable

158
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,000
I know that they have some bad cheese

159
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,860
and maybe somewhere specific where like

160
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,900
starting so rather unstable controller

161
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,390
to deploy everything I know that

162
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,150
OpenStack is using ansible for the world

163
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,070
she is someone somewhere else what can

164
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,080
explain for the can explain that to you

165
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,470
I gave that for something like 100 it

166
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,020
should be fine maybe more - then I have

167
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,480
no clue and we don't even can decide to

168
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,760
start multiple process at the same time

169
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,890
you just need to connect to something

170
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,760
using the regular API so it's not gonna

171
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,690
be a huge bottleneck so I do not see any

172
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,520
limitation beside the CPU

173
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,020
because that's in Python it's not

174
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,090
exactly the fastest language in the

175
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,210
world I'm not sure there is some

176
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,690
limitation regarding regarding network

177
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,400
so it should not be a problem there

178
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,040
there is no disc issue it should work

179
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,770
fine and I guess you will likely get

180
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,650
some limitation regarding the expression

181
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,870
of what you want to do like so then you

182
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,730
want to configure one advantage maybe

183
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,230
that means that you need to get 1

184
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,330
million IP address in a file and I'm

185
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,980
pretty sure we are not testing that and

186
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,270
I'm pretty sure it's not the right

187
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,070
approach and you need something more

188
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,740
either well my thought is Melanie's

189
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,809
seasoned mill and networks are doing

190
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,940
stuff in the traditional way but

191
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,140
depending where completed the

192
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,260
installation is a huge effort so maybe

193
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,840
start to get people comfortable with the

194
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,120
idea of doing your script and deployment

195
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,550
and automation can be a small step

196
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,170
because you're something that's wrong

197
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,600
you can still go back you try to fix

198
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,130
stuff from the system is fixing your

199
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,540
pics that's great my rescale is mostly

200
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,400
to be able to delegate to adapt with a

201
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,240
git commit and let the developer from

202
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,910
the community to drag their stuff into

203
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,940
me breaking stuff for them and I think

204
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,520
someone having another efficient

205
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:43,890
can you speak over there so the question

206
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,410
was everybody on 12 it's what you say

207
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,250
okay perfect

208
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,020
I'm not sure to know what you mean but

209
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:58,880
it says well now I would burn so that's

210
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,480
the question is isn't very similar to

211
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,410
Sdn controller

212
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,059

213
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:57,139
which is because which is if you want to

214
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,940
test the lab you do not need anything

215
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,779
but a laptop and we have to do something

216
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,019
and fix it we want to run it where you

217
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,759
want you want to set up a Raspberry Pi

218
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,980
it's running if you want to set up and

219
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,509
Ruby it's running

220
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,379
I mean I've been doing this I think I

221
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,080
have no time for questions so again if

222
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,220
you want to contact me I will

223
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,700
