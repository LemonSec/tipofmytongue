[Music]

2
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,000
okay audio test one two one two one two

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,109
[Music]

4
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,110
okay so hi I'm Conrad Bebbington I'm

5
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,780
here from focus right we make audio

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
interfaces and various other kinds of

7
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,820
audio equipment and I'm talking about

8
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,870
AES 67 a standard for networking in pro

9
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,729
audio industry so just to set the scene

10
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,320
what we're looking at the industry

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,670
itself is is studio audio live sound

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,149
also things like broadcast and also

13
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,880
theatres house worship all those kinds

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,590
of things that have sound systems and

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,680
audio groups handling

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,660
so traditionally audio has been done

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,789
over analog there's been a move to

18
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,680
digital and more recently there's been a

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,470
move to networked audio so the type of

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,310
devices we're looking at here range from

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,229
microphones preamplifiers so getting

22
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,660
your audio in mixes and effects to

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,660
process your audio interfaces to connect

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,369
it up to different things all the way

25
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,039
out to umpires and speakers so you can

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:54,509
actually hear it so here's just for

27
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,119
example a typical live sound setup this

28
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,369
is the kind of thing we have so we have

29
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,179
microphone inputs here and various sound

30
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,130
sources which get fed into the audio

31
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,220
network this will be taken via the

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,280
ethernet over to mixing console perhaps

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,610
perhaps to a computer so you can record

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,239
and the audio is processed here and then

35
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,400
sent back out over the network to our

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,739
output system which will be for

37
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,930
monitoring on the stage and for

38
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,910
front-of-house sound for so the audience

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,459
can hear it so that's a pretty typical

40
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,989
setup so in an audio network we have

41
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,510
specific requirements we're only dealing

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,190
with local area networks we're not

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,060
putting audio over the Internet and that

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,990
frees us up from a loss

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,290
of variability with traffic levels and

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,310
congestion we want low latency we want

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,140
high quality and most importantly lots

48
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,240
of channels and we cannot have lost the

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,460
compression in these systems we want

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,050
good quality quality audio so the

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,210
existing technologies there's already

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,810
stopped serving this market and they are

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,030
various kind of proprietary technologies

54
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,480
and so they're just various brands there

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,970
and we can have a look at them in some

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,570
detail and so there's various levels of

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,940
protocol and various solutions within

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,340
those levels for all of our different

59
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,460
proprietary audio technologies and as

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,560
you can see on this chart there's a lot

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,810
of proprietary stuff in in these systems

62
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,720
so that actually hurts our Interop us

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,880
you know connecting these audio systems

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,030
together is actually quite difficult so

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,290
and that's both a limitation that

66
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,140
impacts convenience it is in flats

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,410
future proofing which can be quite an

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,980
issue a lot of equipment is expensive so

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,600
so being able to knowing that you can

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,880
use it in the future is quite important

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,760
and there's a particular pain point in

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,029
the broadcast industry especially with a

73
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,100
lot of live sound in studio you can just

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,930
be careful what you buy and put into

75
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,100
your system and how it be compatible

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,610
with broadcasts they want to go to other

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,410
people's events they want to take their

78
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,960
OB truck their outside broadcast truck

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,750
take it to the stadium this is from

80
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,570
Wimbledon and they want to plug into the

81
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,910
audio systems and the video systems on

82
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,640
that Stadium and get feeds of what's

83
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,630
going on so they can broadcast so so we

84
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,190
can't deal with bad Interop here

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,640
so a s67 is a standard developed by the

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,970
Audio Engineering Society aiming to

87
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,310
bridge these format these technologies

88
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,510
together it specifies various levels of

89
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,890
the system but it specifically excludes

90
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,860
device discovery and control because

91
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,340
that's not so necessary for transporting

92
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,760
the audio pursuing systems and it was

93
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,740
seen as better to get some level of

94
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,650
standardization rather than developing

95
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,990
into kind of a big discussion that goes

96
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,710
nowhere

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,880
so those areas were excluded the

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,180
technology is in AES 67 are actually all

99
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,570
fairly standard existing IT technologies

100
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,520
in the audio industry it's relatively

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,030
small group of companies compared to say

102
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,100
your googles or your Amazons or whatever

103
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,680
so they don't necessarily have huge

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,970
amounts of engineers to put it the

105
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,910
problem so anywhere they can reuse an

106
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,920
existing technology is a benefit so yeah

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,980
this is a s6 so I'm just breaking that

108
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,070
they're sitting Hajis on IP and here's

109
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,460
an overview of what's in it so at the

110
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,200
very bottom layer we have our audio

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,870
format we just use PCM nothing fancy

112
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,890
that

113
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,330
we use our TPD packetization we use a

114
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,850
precision time protocol that's an I

115
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,910
Triple E standard and then for session

116
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,220
description and connection management we

117
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,320
actually borrow from kind of the voice

118
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:38,200
over IP world and we use STP and sip so

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,780
yeah so I'm going to just take through

120
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,330
each layer now and at the bottom layer

121
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,840
is the audio format we standardized on

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,230
linear PCM there are two formats that

123
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,980
are mandated by the standard those are

124
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,440
the 48 kilohertz sample frequency

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,800
formats and then the optional formats

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
the lowest quality is CD quality

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,820
a higher quality is 96 kilohertz 24-bit

128
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,810
and the standard leaves it open that you

129
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,540
can implement over formats but these are

130
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,670
the standard ones so once we've got our

131
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,550
audio we put it into packets we use RTP

132
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,620
for this and for simplicity the AES 67

133
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,610
standard actually specifies that you

134
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,190
cannot use c.src so you can't use

135
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,350
contributing sources and you can't use

136
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,500
header extensions a lot of the audio

137
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,960
processing happens on embedded hardware

138
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,930
devices so keeping things simple is

139
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,690
important here we the the standard

140
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,370
mandates eight channels per stream and

141
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,310
has short packet times that's the amount

142
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,710
of audio time voice you put in a packet

143
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,990
so there that's short to keep the

144
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,810
latency down and yeah multicast is

145
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,860
optional now in order to make an audio

146
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,460
network work there's synchronization

147
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,460
this is kind of the magic thing which

148
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,100
differentiates an audio network from a

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,250
typical media setting in a in a typical

150
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,410
setting there is some tolerance for

151
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,650
things like a sample glitch or or a

152
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,630
slight delay or those kinds of things

153
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,970
and some jitter buffers in an audio

154
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,680
network there is less tolerance for this

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,979
a sample glitch and being amplified up

156
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,090
on a massive sound system a is quite

157
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,469
harsh on these she would say so so to do

158
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,780
this muse and I Triple E standard the

159
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,880
one five AP this uses a consensus

160
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,690
election system to select a master clock

161
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,170
and then periodically between kind of

162
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,790
four times a second and ten times a

163
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,770
second the master clock initiates

164
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,240
synchronization with all the slave

165
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,780
devices and that me and over a time

166
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,860
period those clocks converge and once we

167
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,290
have this network clock as it's called

168
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,779
we derive a media clock by a simple more

169
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,560
application so in a typical case women

170
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
get 48 kilohertz sample frequency it's

171
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,810
just defined that one second of network

172
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,949
clock has 48,000 sometimes a sample time

173
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:31,290
that's in it and that's just simple

174
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,089
multiplication so the sick the

175
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:40,800
synchronization process is is done in

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,759
two stages

177
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,720
first is the clock sync where the master

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,389
sends a sync packet and then notifies

179
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,999
the receiving slave of what time

180
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:55,290
something that hot once that's done the

181
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,100
slave can initiate a delay request where

182
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,180
it goes I think the time is this that

183
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,470
goes back to the master the master

184
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,370
measures what the time is and it sends

185
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,120
back what it's time loss and using this

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,660
we can measure the network delay and

187
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,850
after a few cycles the clocks will

188
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,680
converge because we will know our

189
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,000
network delay we'll know where our

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,230
master is and we can compare our clocks

191
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,089
it typically takes a couple of seconds

192
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,350
for a clock to converge in most

193
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,660
situations so once we've got our audio

194
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,579
we've privatized it I mean we've

195
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,149
synchronized we need a way to tell our

196
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:41,610
different devices what our audio streams

197
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,050
are and this is where session

198
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,500
description comes in it mostly used the

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,680
SDP standard there are a couple of

200
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,730
additional header items they call head

201
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,079
of attributes sorry in in in our SDP

202
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,179
these specify what packet time we're

203
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,050
using and what are what our clock

204
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,709
sources are and how to map payloads the

205
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,790
rest of it is standard SDP so if you've

206
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,089
seen their CP before yeah it was

207
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,889
something like this so in this case

208
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,480
we're sending a channels of audio at

209
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,990
eight kilohertz there's a 250 micro

210
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,880
second packet time so we're sending

211
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,310
quite short bursts of audio quite often

212
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,579
that keeps latency down and here we

213
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:43,269
specify a precision time protocol clock

214
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,940
domain which is our synchronization

215
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,740
mechanism and then we just offsets the

216
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,800
the media clock from that time to me so

217
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,170
now to connect things together we have

218
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,610
the connection measurement

219
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,160
this is sip again a very standard

220
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,810
protocol used widely in

221
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,110
videoconferencing voice over IP various

222
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,440
other industries

223
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,339
it's your is based on your ice and in

224
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,630
80's 67 the standard recommends actually

225
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,720
using service mode so sip allows you to

226
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,220
put a lots of infrastructure in your

227
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,399
network and for transforming sip

228
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,550
requests routing them to places and

229
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,230
that's kind of not recommended for this

230
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,630
use case it's it's over complicates

231
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,139
things

232
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,459
so so in a s67 service mode is used and

233
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,139
you just have direct connect connections

234
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,910
between your audio devices so there's a

235
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,339
simple succession this is as simple as

236
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,410
it gets

237
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:55,810
is is device a just invites if device we

238
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,910
can receive the media device we just

239
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,480
says yeah okay media flows and then to

240
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,699
tear the connection down there's a buy

241
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,779
packet and and okay it that's the

242
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,120
simplest case and if you look up sitting

243
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,670
you can see this various lot more

244
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,819
complicated cases available the other

245
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,209
connection management we have is IGMP

246
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,350
this is for multicast so it's possible

247
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,440
to have a network device put out the

248
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,480
audio onto the network and to a

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,949
multicast feed and in this case we just

250
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,290
use the standard idmp which tells the

251
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,790
network reuters

252
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,700
where where this audio is required

253
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,860
there's no direct connection between the

254
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,260
sending device and the receiving device

255
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,280
as far as its concerned it's just

256
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,680
putting audio onto the network and

257
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,150
whatever needs it will just pick it up

258
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,720
and so that simplifies our stack and you

259
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,310
know it has all the usual advantages

260
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,590
bandwidth usage water etcetera so that's

261
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,130
what's in the standard so who who's the

262
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,670
organization's well there's two of them

263
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,680
there's the AES the audio engineer

264
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,070
Society they're handling the

265
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,870
standardization and the technical

266
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,510
discussion around the standard and then

267
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,310
there's the media networking Alliance

268
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,430
who are more involved in the actual

269
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,480
promotion of the standard and some of

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,370
the more informal discussion around what

271
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,690
she's going and how to do it so there

272
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,790
are a number of members of the media

273
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,370
networking Alliance as focus right there

274
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,000
there's Yamaha as Harlan was Bosch

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,150
security and there's also associate

276
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,390
members beast tend to be less equipment

277
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,730
manufacturers and more like natural

278
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,150
media companies so for example I believe

279
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,390
Swedish radio is an associate made

280
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,710
member as is the BBC and I think Disney

281
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,440
Imagineering that those kinds of

282
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,070
companies are all associate members so

283
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,600
so the things I want to get across here

284
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,590
are we've are the a of 67 is

285
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,610
standardization and that improves

286
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,850
interrupts it's bridging a gap that said

287
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,610
risk was previously couldn't just

288
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,610
couldn't connect devices together and it

289
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,040
shows the reefs of general purpose

290
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,470
technology in a specific environment in

291
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,800
this case for audio and it's also

292
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,440
showing kind of the growing interaction

293
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,940
between the technology industry and the

294
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,720
pro audio industry previously there's

295
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,600
some interaction but with the growth of

296
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,160
audio networks there's a lot more in net

297
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,399
in general and and there's a lot more

298
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,990
overlap now so for more information

299
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,720
there's the media networking alliance

300
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,709
and you can go to the AES for actual

301
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,240
copies of the standards documents

302
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,910
they're pretty long I'm going to deepen

303
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,939
as you expect from those so I think

304
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,689
that's it for now

305
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,650
[Music]

306
00:17:52,170 --> 00:18:14,320
you can ethics or so okay okay so the

307
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,890
question roughly is around well there is

308
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,980
certainly lacking open source code for

309
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,990
this standard and there is a certain

310
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,140
amount of dominance around ordinates and

311
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,730
their path and their patents so I'd say

312
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,920
that in terms of opening up having the

313
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,840
open standard the humming of standard is

314
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,920
kind of probably the first step and I

315
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,320
yes admits that there is a long way to

316
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,250
go between with interaction between say

317
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,180
pro audio and the open source community

318
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,660
so I Eve use having standard as a first

319
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,330
step on quite long path

320
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,470
okay so that's the point that's the is

321
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:16,670
did you say okay

322
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:17,149
yeah do you have anything to suggest to

323
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,950
the colonel people about how they can

324
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:28,279
make okay so this is a question around

325
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,369
sound development in Linux and how we

326
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,859
might make Elsa and better for the

327
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,399
professional case that's a that's a

328
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:51,169
tough one yeah you need real word i this

329
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,479
is a tough one because personally and

330
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,629
being in audio more I haven't been on

331
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:03,679
Linux all that much recently yeah I

332
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,509
