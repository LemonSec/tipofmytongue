1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:05,299
okay our next speaker is Mars Court

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,940
corrupt corporate talking about mixed

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,830
places false projects unintended

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,740
consequences work examples and best

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,940
practices yes yes thanks for coming I

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,500
hope this will be an interesting talk

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,130
I'm gonna cover topics such as how come

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,680
in the how pond is that the project's

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,410
Amex license license itself the

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,750
challenges around mixed managing mixed

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,380
license projects stuff people generally

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,820
or contributors generally don't think

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,280
about and their consequences and I'm

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,170
gonna kind of put this in make this a

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,590
bit real through some water stories from

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,960
the exam project and then I'll conclude

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,050
with best practice at the end a little

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,539
bit about me

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,309
you see a few pictures there I love to

20
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,090
travel to weird places so and I'm trying

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,820
to use some of my holiday snaps you know

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,809
in the in the presentation and where it

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,780
makes sense I was a contributor to not

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,409
numerous projects I worked in a lot of

25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,290
different industry segments from

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,659
parallel computing tools to mobile and

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,960
now virtualization I'm essentially the

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,689
community guy for accent project I get

29
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,610
paid by Citrix but I'm essentially

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,630
accountable to the community and I put

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,189
this talk together because I led a

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,700
number of different licensing related

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,680
activities last year on behalf of the

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,860
project but also within Citrix so just

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,259
at the scene I really wanted to sort of

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,310
look at the question of how many

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,009
open-source projects which claim that

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,439
mix you know single license are actually

39
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,299
single license so so let's just start

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,979
out you know I just started out with a

41
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,189
random number of projects which I tend

42
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,149
to work with I did this for more of them

43
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,250
but you know it's you know if we can do

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,620
end

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,560
this so just pick four so Linux says

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,950
it's gplv2 GMU says it's gplv2

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,400
then you know we said we're gplv2 - you

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,840
know FreeBSD s BSD and you know you can

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,340
make an endless list of those right so

50
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,819
then I kind of asked myself you know

51
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,129
what is actually the percentage of files

52
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,620
you know which are in a let's call it

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,030
native license you know of that project

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,060
now you may have seen you know like you

55
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,450
see an a like you know a picture of sand

56
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,310
the idea there is that you know like you

57
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,930
know if you look at a heap of sand from

58
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,500
afar it looks very pure and you know if

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,620
you look close up it's less pure and so

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,879
there's a little bit of an idea of

61
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,030
entropy you know going on there and that

62
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,590
sort of becomes a little bit of a scene

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,159
throughout the presentation so let's

64
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,140
look look back at those four projects

65
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:18,069
right so what I did there is I ran scan

66
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,870
code because that's easy and quick to

67
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,480
run run it's not entirely accurate it's

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,060
not very accurate over the code bases of

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,780
those four projects and came up with an

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,760
estimate of how much of it is actually

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,500
the license it claims to be

72
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,560
I did put an upper bound in place

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,530
because there are lots of files in those

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,239
projects which actually have no

75
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,030
copyright headers at all and you know

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,150
the assumption there is that most of the

77
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,220
time that's the native license but then

78
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,319
there might be some directories which

79
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,449
are entirely of a different license so

80
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,340
that means that it's basically just an

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,440
upper bound and estimation but what's

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,139
interesting now is that actually a quite

83
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,660
a significant proportion within those

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,250
projects are actually of different

85
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,269
licenses and you know I didn't just do

86
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,660
this exercise for those four projects I

87
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,449
did this for a few more and I kind of

88
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,240
actually led me to believe that most

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,260
projects or many projects maybe

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,630
most you know of those who claim their

91
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,670
single license projects are aren't in

92
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,170
fact signore license and then I wanted

93
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,670
to look at some of the reasons you know

94
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,550
why do projects you know allow licenses

95
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,120
artists and one estate into into the

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,670
codebase so there may be lots of

97
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,650
different reasons you might want to

98
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,900
interface you know with another project

99
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,420
of another license so you know if your

100
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,300
gplv2 you and your header files are GPL

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,400
v2 obviously that's a project a problem

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,710
you know if you want to use it in a you

103
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,980
know in another project you may want to

104
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,490
allow other projects to interface with

105
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,530
you so the same issue quite frequently

106
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,270
you may want to import code from other

107
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,130
projects and then coming back to this

108
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,860
whole idea of entropy is you may not

109
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,070
have clear rules that govern license

110
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,230
except accept exceptions within your

111
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,780
project and if you don't have clear

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,020
rules that just means people assume that

113
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,700
it's okay to add code with another

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,580
compatible license to your project which

115
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,380
comes back to this whole idea of entropy

116
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,700
you know if you don't have clear rules

117
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,850
then people will just add stuff and you

118
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,580
will get increasingly you know mixed

119
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,220
license over time so the point is all

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,260
these you know reasons are actually good

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,390
and valid reasons for license exceptions

122
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,160
right there's no problem really with

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,190
this the problem comes if you don't if

124
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
you do that and you don't have any

125
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,100
guidance you don't have any best

126
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,020
practice and you don't have any tooling

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,690
or but you know processes in place to

128
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,890
really enforce you know a set of rules

129
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,920
around what you want to achieve and you

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,870
know if you don't have that you may

131
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,400
expose yourself to a number of

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,270
unintended consequences and you know

133
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,340
some of them could potentially be quite

134
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,790
significant and that's where we get into

135
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,920
the war stories from from

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,800
and project so we looked at a number of

137
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,320
examples where we tripped over this last

138
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,140
year so there were three major

139
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,080
storylines the first one will be around

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,070
a major contributor fundamentally trying

141
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,150
to looking at our code base to get you

142
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,530
know their employees agreement to

143
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,510
contribute to our project so that's

144
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,910
quite similar to the talk we had you

145
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,750
know beforehand around clas and some of

146
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,820
the challenges vendors you know face and

147
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,490
so there's an element of making is

148
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,870
easier for a project we are going to

149
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,460
look at a worked example of realizing a

150
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,340
component and you know how this kind of

151
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,840
works in practice and kind of some of

152
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,510
the challenges you might trip over and

153
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,280
how maybe you can avoid that in the

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,610
first place and then a really

155
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,470
interesting one which is around gplv2

156
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,680
what vx you know only and gplv2 VX or

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,460
later where there's quite a few which is

158
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,590
not very well understood generally in

159
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,420
the community and I must admit I didn't

160
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,610
understand this very well either

161
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,280
until I tripped over it so but before

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:07,120
that what is 6m project well we develop

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
open source virtualization technology

164
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,980
and we've been around since 2003 we have

165
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,740
a number of sub projects the hypervisor

166
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,060
pool stacks

167
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,910
Niraj away as drivers and so on and so

168
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,550
forth so the steps I quoted earlier they

169
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,020
just relate to the hypervisor itself and

170
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,460
we're Linux Foundation collaborative

171
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,970
project with a number of big commercial

172
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,030
backers behind it which helped you know

173
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,299
was infrastructure blah blah blah so

174
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,059
what are our reasons you know for

175
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,690
license exceptions in the codebase

176
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,699
now in many ways they're actually

177
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,910
exactly the same ones as as I listed

178
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,319
earlier they're just a little bit more

179
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:57,190
specialized so we want to enable guest

180
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,290
operating systems we want to enable

181
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,540
guest operating systems which are GPL

182
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,730
right so we want to be able to run those

183
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,860
operating systems on top of our

184
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,870
hypervisor and it means you know we have

185
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,579
to provide some kind of interfaces to do

186
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,480
that and we do that through making most

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,790
of our public headers you know BSD or

188
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,790
MIT licenses we won't make it possible

189
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,819
for such operating systems to have send

190
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,990
support to use them as control domain

191
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,730
and again you know some of the common

192
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,069
code for that reason is BSD style or

193
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:38,889
some of it is duly licensed we also you

194
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,579
know have a big ecosystem around our

195
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,689
code base so we want to be able to have

196
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:49,240
libraries you know being linked into sir

197
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,459
party tools even proprietary ones and so

198
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,759
some key licenses we reuse LGPL for that

199
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,529
reason

200
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,110
oops I want to be able to import code

201
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,689
from other projects particularly you

202
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,000
know Linux and so on some stuff we have

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,439
to just import now we didn't have any

204
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,810
codified you know witness at the

205
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,579
beginning of last year we didn't have

206
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,860
any codified rules around licensing

207
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,449
exceptions you know but there were some

208
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,550
practices and how people in the

209
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,130
community operated but fundamentally you

210
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,050
know we just assumed we were single

211
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,509
aizen's project right and we were sort

212
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,130
of totally oblivious to the fact that

213
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,170
actually does lots of other licenses in

214
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,740
the codebase and the first story line is

215
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,120
really around the perils you know of not

216
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,180
having licensing information easily

217
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,120
consumable by lawyers who might look at

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,860
your codebase and who might make

219
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,439
decisions about whether it's okay for

220
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,569
their company you know to contribute to

221
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,519
your project so I don't want to name

222
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,259
companies so what I'm going to do there

223
00:10:59,259 --> 00:10:59,870
is

224
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,820
for each company I'm going to use the

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,240
codename and I'm using code names from

226
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,420
basically from plant life so that what

227
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,580
you see here is a dragon blood tree and

228
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,860
so you know in 2015 we had a large

229
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,770
vendor we called him dragon blood who

230
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,650
was reviewing the project with of you to

231
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,690
allow their employees to contribute to

232
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,930
our project so you know this was around

233
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,690
October or so 2015 Dragon block company

234
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,000
they put an IP lawyer you know onto our

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,570
project and I started an IP and patent

236
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,960
review and the IP lawyer was very very

237
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:50,840
sorrow so they evaluated license looked

238
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,150
at all the copying files came across

239
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,040
some inconsistencies sort of started

240
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,230
running for Saleh G you know on our code

241
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,660
base and then I started to you know

242
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,030
contact the Linux Foundation and later

243
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,850
me and started to ask lots of questions

244
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,490
right so they picked that number picked

245
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,950
up a number of mismatches between what

246
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,900
some of the copying files said and what

247
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,730
was in some of the code you know in some

248
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,380
of the code these were all just

249
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,630
relatively minor issues so in one case

250
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,240
you know the copying files said well you

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,130
know our you know our public headers use

252
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,010
bsd-style licenses and then a few files

253
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,100
were MIT license right and then the

254
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,530
lawyer picked this up and then he wanted

255
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,300
you know and and then it started you

256
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,460
know lots of presidents started they

257
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,610
also picked up all these licensing

258
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,710
exceptions for the facility review and

259
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,740
basically wanted to know you know why we

260
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,080
used another license right and then all

261
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,470
these questions came to me and while

262
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,050
this whole process happened they

263
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,670
wouldn't allow their staff to contribute

264
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,500
to our project right they want to have

265
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,490
all the answers first

266
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,470
I don't know how common this is right

267
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,100
whether this is an unusual case but

268
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,390
that's what kind of happened and that's

269
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,600
what might happen to other projects too

270
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,710
so

271
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,020
I ended up doing a lot of code

272
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,990
archaeology to basically answer you know

273
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,170
all of their questions to make sure that

274
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,150
you know it's a big company such that I

275
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,620
would contribute to the project because

276
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,800
I didn't want them not to having them on

277
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,650
board would have been an asset so I had

278
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,630
to look at you know I black like you

279
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,960
know a long list of questions and it

280
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,940
typically fell into two classes of

281
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,700
questions you know why was a specific

282
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,770
you know component license in a specific

283
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,460
way and you know what was the rationale

284
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,080
why a piece of code from elsewhere was

285
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,090
imported and where did it come from and

286
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,870
so on and so forth and after you know

287
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,380
after six months of you know email

288
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,540
exchanges between me and the lawyer

289
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,580
eventually they agreed stuff to

290
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,240
contribute to the project so first

291
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,460
question is why did this take so long

292
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,430
right

293
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,250
well from my perspective there was you

294
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,230
know all the information which was

295
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,900
needed was actually there

296
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,030
it was just wasn't easily consumable

297
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,990
right so you know we we had you know

298
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,030
like all the information when we

299
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,770
imported code you know all this kind of

300
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,570
stuff was there but sometimes it was in

301
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,090
commit logs sometimes it was in header

302
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,480
files you know sometimes it was in

303
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,690
another file somewhere in a tree

304
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,090
sometimes in a copying file sometimes in

305
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,400
what you know in an email which some of

306
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,380
these files referred to you right so

307
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,840
that took a very long time to actually

308
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,130
pull together and you know as a lawyer

309
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,360
obviously if you look at this you're

310
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,470
just gonna look at this all the

311
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,060
information isn't there they're not

312
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,580
following good practice that's not my

313
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,400
problem you know they're you know have

314
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,260
the community manager deal with this

315
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,050
right because there were some

316
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,410
inconsistencies basically out of

317
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,840
relationship and conversation with the

318
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
lawyer basically started off the wrong

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,210
foot as well you know they came across

320
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,950
things like wait said one thing but the

321
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,570
reality was others so that didn't

322
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,760
immediately build trust either

323
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,070
and so I had to work quite hard to

324
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,889
eventually build that trust and by being

325
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,820
responsive and of course you know

326
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,019
lawyers tend to work on multiple

327
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,199
projects so in every single time there

328
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,060
was an email exchange that be like two

329
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,370
weeks of silence and you know the whole

330
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,889
process would take a long very long

331
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:51,779
elapsed time so while this was going on

332
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,279
basically our project decided that

333
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,250
really you know we must address this you

334
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,380
know for the future we're going through

335
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,449
this once we're actually doing all this

336
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:04,000
you know all this archeology right now

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,060
we may as well present the information

338
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,180
in a way which makes it easier in the

339
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,980
future for a lawyer I just looked to

340
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,649
look at this right and and make some

341
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,750
decisions so this is what we do did it

342
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,320
wasn't actually that much work in the

343
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,870
codebase to them basically fix that and

344
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,430
because I had to dig out all the

345
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,079
information in the first place to get

346
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,760
that one contributor on board so we we

347
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,160
actually documented you know our rules

348
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,680
and conventions around license

349
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
exceptions and we added this you know

350
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,510
and into the code base entry so for

351
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,899
example now you know each company each

352
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,660
tree which isn't gplv2 basically has a

353
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,350
copying file in it it explains you know

354
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,990
the rationale and some of the reasons

355
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,050
why we're using a specific license you

356
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,240
know higher up we have copying files

357
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,399
which kind of explain you know the

358
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,510
information architecture we're using and

359
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,459
and some of the general guidance but

360
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,880
some of that is kind of described in a

361
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,400
very way you know we're basically you

362
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,530
know we're not saying well our public

363
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,530
headers are BST only if maybe there's

364
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,839
some other stuff in there such that we

365
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,230
don't get this kind of issue around you

366
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,579
know where we say one thing and then

367
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,290
when you do it dig into it it's not

368
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,780
quite accurate which can build mistrust

369
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,820
right then for every source file you

370
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,559
know for every piece of code we impor

371
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,190
from somewhere else we you know we

372
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,080
basically have a readme dot source file

373
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,210
record for you know smaller directories

374
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,340
we kind of have one file and here we

375
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,690
just keep a record for every code import

376
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,970
we have from another project and even

377
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,389
for code which is also GPL v2 so if you

378
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,789
import the codes you know a file or a

379
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,620
piece of code somewhere from Linux we

380
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,350
kind of record that in that file and it

381
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,990
file contains information such as you

382
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,879
know why do we imported where's it from

383
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,309
you know and other meta information so

384
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,139
she can follow that up at some point in

385
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,139
the future and we fix some of the

386
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,190
inconsistencies in our documentation

387
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,710
such that you know when a lawyer looks

388
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,409
at it they can't point out what you say

389
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,029
one thing but actually that's not quite

390
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:33,399
a truce so so we fixed that so that kind

391
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:40,860
of was the first story the second one is

392
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,100
it's basically about realizing a key

393
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,350
component within the project so there

394
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,539
I'm gonna look at now the general

395
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,610
workflow and some of the challenges we

396
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:01,210
find found around doing this so the the

397
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,200
component in question and you can then

398
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,929
look that up is Apache areas called

399
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,970
make the ACPI build available to

400
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,090
components other than h vm loader that

401
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,649
sounds pretty you know well o pack if

402
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:20,409
you want so but actually behind behind

403
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,749
you know this is a major change which

404
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:24,669
are not enables a major new piece of

405
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,220
functionality and actually all we wanted

406
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,529
to do is we had to move you know a

407
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,419
component around the stack somewhere

408
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:31,899
else

409
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,249
but because of that we don't have to

410
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,679
make a license change to kind of explain

411
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,429
this i want to talk a introduce a bit of

412
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,080
terminology and taxonomy such that that

413
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,970
whole thing becomes a little bit clearer

414
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,529
this is an orchid here by the way around

415
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:50,809
a weird one which i

416
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,360
found on in Costa Rica when I was

417
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:02,429
traveling there but yeah so so very

418
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,890
brief introduction over architecture and

419
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,419
and I'm we're gonna be like that to

420
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,200
licensing so you know at the bottom you

421
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,429
have to hardware then you have a

422
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,010
hypervisor fills with things like

423
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,080
configuration is scheduling memory all

424
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,900
those kind of things then we have you

425
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,390
know a virtual machine which we the

426
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,919
first virtual machine which is started

427
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,140
up in the system is called on 0 of the M

428
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,080
0 that contains you know a kernel Linux

429
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,780
or BSD or some other operating system

430
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,380
and that has drivers in it and we

431
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,200
obviously we have a guest VMs with a

432
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,370
guest OS and applications and they also

433
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,140
have drivers in it which talk to the

434
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,630
drivers in non zero and then talk to the

435
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,540
hardware and indeed interesting and

436
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,299
missing piece where where the changes is

437
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,059
a single tool stack which basically

438
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,610
controls the entire system and has some

439
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,830
third party at a console or graphical

440
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,990
tool on it which talks to this and then

441
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,520
the whole thing is sort of replicated

442
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,970
across the board and licensing terms

443
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,240
right basically most of the hypervisor

444
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,020
lower-level stuff is is basically gplv2

445
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,270
most of our drivers are GPL v2 as well

446
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,130
but some of them are other licenses for

447
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,080
example you know windows drivers

448
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,460
obviously can't be GPL and then you know

449
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,530
I was mentioning earlier some of our

450
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,590
utility libraries like libet's excel and

451
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:41,790
let's see there LGPL so and that's here

452
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,040
you see the if you want to check that

453
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,910
afterwards you can basically look at

454
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,309
those slides in a bit more detail so

455
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,010
what does this mean for the ACPI builder

456
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,990
change i was mentioning earlier so

457
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,940
basically just gotta take everything out

458
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,370
of this diagram which isn't really

459
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,230
relevant and there we have you know the

460
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,149
atrium uploader which is used

461
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:06,419
the hypervisor and the a CPI builder is

462
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,849
used by the atrium loader and to make

463
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,089
this change we basically had to

464
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,450
introduce a new relationships where the

465
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,109
LGPL code you know had to use you know

466
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,450
we wanted to be able to use it in the da

467
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,070
CPI builder in the bad cell now what

468
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,349
were our options at this you know stage

469
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:31,979
well we could reimplementation

470
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:35,279
and make it you know an integrated into

471
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,809
the top library but to do that you know

472
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,669
we would have to really technically do

473
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,399
every clean room implementation and that

474
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,679
would have been really hard and probably

475
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,529
not really been doable because you know

476
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,029
the same people who wrote this stuff

477
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:52,769
originally would have had to write a new

478
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,859
thing in the again or we could just say

479
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:58,259
well actually what you've got a link

480
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,839
that you know gplv2 library into that

481
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,820
LGPL one button if you link the two

482
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,979
together then basically the whole thing

483
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:08,070
becomes you know GPL and then you know

484
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,229
that would create some that would have

485
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,820
been too disruptive for everybody who

486
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,389
uses this library or you know we could

487
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,739
just realize of it

488
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,629
and it seems relatively straightforward

489
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,489
there was not much code now probably

490
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,639
about 30 files or so you know probably

491
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:25,889
about 30 contributors didn't really

492
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:30,929
sound so bad so we decided to realizes

493
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,139
to sing from gplv3 tree LGPL so first

494
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,690
there's an observation that actually

495
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,779
refactoring an ongoing development you

496
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,279
know might lead might require

497
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,399
unanticipated license changes if your

498
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,950
project you know has multiple licenses

499
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,690
you know if everything's the same

500
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,219
license obviously does never gonna

501
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:56,219
happen and maybe this could have been

502
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,989
avoided with a bit more foresight and

503
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:01,019
planning so I guess you know when you

504
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,179
when you architect your system and

505
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,549
really you know introduce new components

506
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,979
maybe it makes sense to think a little

507
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,869
bit forward about you know where might

508
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:11,729
this actually see erratically be used at

509
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,289
some point in the future and then choose

510
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,290
the license accordingly

511
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,240
probably in our case saw that wouldn't

512
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,550
maybe you know like that component was

513
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,560
introduced more than ten years ago you

514
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,180
know we probably you know at that time

515
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,090
wouldn't have really anticipated we you

516
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,890
know that we may need to be able to use

517
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,690
that thing further up the stack so let's

518
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,870
look at the workflow of relicensing a

519
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,970
component so the first step is really

520
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,090
identifying or the copyright holders and

521
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,780
you know how do you do that well you

522
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,130
you're gonna look at the copyright

523
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,200
header headers of your files you're

524
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,150
gonna look at the get logs you know at

525
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,540
the author's if you have a DCO or

526
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,430
something similar you're going to look

527
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,480
at order a sign of tax and you may also

528
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,010
have to look at the code import history

529
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,040
and in just you know piece the logs from

530
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,020
different projects together so if you

531
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,020
don't to make sure you really get all

532
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,760
the copyright holders in our case we did

533
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,590
all of this but then it turned out you

534
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,180
know that the list of names was the same

535
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,560
as just the ones s came from the DCO and

536
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,350
which is what we would have expected in

537
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,830
the first place which is a good thing so

538
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,240
then you get the list of copyright

539
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,740
holders and typically what I did is I

540
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,960
kind of then you know divided that list

541
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,990
up into individuals who aren't the

542
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,600
copyright and companies because to get

543
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,690
the approval you would you know you what

544
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,040
you would handle this differently for

545
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,840
individuals than for companies and I'll

546
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,220
get to just a little bit later so

547
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,450
identifying copyright holders is really

548
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,790
easy right well maybe not so you could

549
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,550
trip over to league issues so you know

550
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,810
our repository refers to use mercurial

551
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,940
and we can convert it into the entire

552
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,040
tree to get at some point you know like

553
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,120
six or seven years ago

554
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,720
and mercurial doesn't do code motions

555
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,470
very well so you know when you track the

556
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,810
history and then you convert it you know

557
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,670
like when you move files around your

558
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,340
history kind of sort of stops right so

559
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,810
we had to done manually stitch this

560
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,910
together the same can also happen and

561
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,980
get you know if you do if you do your

562
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,710
mock up motions wrong so there's some

563
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,600
technical issues which you could trip

564
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,290
over where you have to be careful about

565
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,840
another I guess well actually what's the

566
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,730
code you know you want to realize this

567
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,800
or some of it imported from elsewhere

568
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,500
right now if you keep good records you

569
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,380
may you know you may have all that data

570
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,820
and may be able to stitch that all

571
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,340
together but probably it's safest to run

572
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,560
surface ology are not a tool over it and

573
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,630
I'm basically kind of establish an

574
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,180
entire chain of where that code came

575
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,060
from now if yes you know if it was

576
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,160
imported from elsewhere then obviously

577
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,740
your list of contributors and a list of

578
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,990
people who might get you need to get

579
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,250
approval from grows and gets bigger in

580
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,530
our case the code was originally

581
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,290
imported from Linux and we nearly missed

582
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,060
that they also could potentially be

583
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,930
issues with clas you know if some of the

584
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,670
code you imported has a CLA then

585
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,470
obviously you may have to ask some other

586
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,410
people like a foundation to get approval

587
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,960
as well another thing which was

588
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,330
interesting was we had some issues

589
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,770
around the use of private email

590
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,110
addresses like company employees and you

591
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,870
know and so we so even so we knew that

592
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,410
some people during a time you know had

593
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,210
worked for a company they used the

594
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,340
private email address so we had to ask

595
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,710
them privately and the company because

596
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,780
we didn't know whatever change was made

597
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,080
on company time or not right so probably

598
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,110
you want to have a policy around that

599
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,380
within the project as well just in case

600
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,180
you know you have to read license a

601
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,840
component at some point so back at the

602
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,200
workflow right so what did we do then

603
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,140
the individuals we count

604
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,230
the nor by emails for the company

605
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,560
contributions basically are trying to

606
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,450
find reps in that company to make a

607
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,430
decision on behalf of the entire company

608
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,830
that was quite easy for us because most

609
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,910
the companies who contribute on our

610
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,430
probe on our project are basically

611
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,050
actively engaging with it's we are

612
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,850
advisory board so I could do this

613
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,650
relatively easy other projects might

614
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,550
find that quite difficult and then it

615
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,720
was a lot of chasing because individual

616
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,060
emails addresses my change you know

617
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,220
people change jobs and so on so I had to

618
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,590
sometimes you know go via LinkedIn and

619
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,690
track people down and so on and so forth

620
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,940
now companies can be a bit of a problem

621
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,900
if if you lose a relationship with so

622
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,580
how do you get you know approval from

623
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,710
somebody were a team which originally

624
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,490
you know introduced a change how do you

625
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,230
know if that X team doesn't exist

626
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,240
anymore and maybe hasn't existed anymore

627
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,660
for like seven or eight years anyway so

628
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,820
if you get the approval right then you

629
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,950
can do the commit you you know keep

630
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,510
records and everything and if not you

631
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,330
need to work find a workaround well in

632
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,720
our case this is a picture of an orchid

633
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,610
I didn't Roby on so we have another code

634
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,890
name come up

635
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,140
we had a contra der that's called me XYZ

636
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,670
who worked for that vendor called

637
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,730
Dendrobium and we couldn't track him

638
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,950
down and we come get his approval he did

639
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,990
this under corporate address but you

640
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,690
know first we thought well let's find

641
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:19,000
out you know whether that guy basically

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,790
still works for that company that failed

643
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,190
because you know like the person was

644
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,170
working was based in China LinkedIn

645
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,270
doesn't work in China you know and we

646
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,280
just couldn't track that person down but

647
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,040
fortunately we have a lot of Chinese

648
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,050
companies we work with so they asked

649
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,850
around so eventually we managed to track

650
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,370
down that person but that didn't really

651
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,950
help us because basically then it turned

652
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,350
out the team didn't exist anymore you

653
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,160
know

654
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,780
none of the people who originally worked

655
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,920
on that stuff worked for that company

656
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,000
anymore and you know so we saw that

657
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,050
didn't actually lead us anyway Denisov

658
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,000
started thinking well actually maybe I

659
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,710
can search for some other open source

660
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,660
contributions from the company to other

661
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,480
projects and you know get to somebody

662
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,100
who cares about open source in that

663
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,910
company well as it turned out there's no

664
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,110
you know there were no recent

665
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,060
contributions from that company to any

666
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,470
project and then I just started

667
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,150
searching for you know on LinkedIn

668
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,610
generally for you know open source staff

669
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,070
and CTO office staff and so on and so

670
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,170
forth and eventually I got a hit and

671
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,330
they got back to me but at that point we

672
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,890
kind of saw probably this is gonna lead

673
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,370
any to anywhere you know we're never

674
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,990
gonna get approval from the company

675
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,270
let's look at a back-up plan but luckily

676
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,520
we did get that approval it just took

677
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,070
some time until I basically decided what

678
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,600
to do with that contribution that was

679
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,890
around 15 lines of code really right so

680
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,030
we made a contingency plan and we used

681
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,820
the fact that binaries and not source

682
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,340
code a licensed right so we took the a

683
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,130
CPI loader codebase and build two

684
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,610
variants of it from it one which had you

685
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,710
know which was used in a lower level

686
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,930
where we needed everything which was you

687
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:15,010
know GPL and the other variant would

688
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,790
just you know use part of it and was

689
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:24,040
LGPL we were initially we were looking

690
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,630
at what can we just you know take that

691
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,850
code sort of out but that was just -

692
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,550
that would have been too complicated to

693
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,440
do because it happens of so far in the

694
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,050
past so we built it built these two

695
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,300
variants and we made sure that you know

696
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,090
all the gplv2 croud was clearly

697
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,830
separated such that we could maintain

698
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,080
that going in going forward in a future

699
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,390
but actually this would have been really

700
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,940
ugly not easily not easily maintainable

701
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,760
and so on and so forth so so we're

702
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,140
really lucky that we could actually

703
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,440
track down

704
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,140
that company got the approval and didn't

705
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,640
actually have to go for the workaround

706
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,950
so what were our work to put pain points

707
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,210
around this whole process

708
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,910
well tooling right you have to be really

709
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,610
careful you know around particularly

710
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,680
code motions you know if you don't do

711
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,630
this right then you might lose some part

712
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,740
of your history documentation we also

713
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,290
tripped over the fact that we didn't

714
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,470
have a record for some code imports from

715
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,900
Linux in a suite needed source file

716
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,750
pattern and we nearly missed that

717
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,640
dependency right which would have meant

718
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,800
we would have possibly missed some

719
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,810
copyright holders whose approvals we

720
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:45,060
needed this wasn't so much an issue with

721
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,580
with this particular relicensing but

722
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,980
I've had other ones where this has come

723
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,400
up a lot is sign of some company times

724
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,830
or you know where people use private

725
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,150
email addresses so you probably want to

726
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,960
have a policy around this in particular

727
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,270
if your project allows a Lea you know

728
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,250
like many projects is like the Linux

729
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,760
kernel gives contributors kernel.org

730
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,230
aliases we do have the same we have

731
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,449
accent project or work alias well

732
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,580
actually what does it mean if somebody

733
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,030
signs you know with that alias right is

734
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,949
that a personal contribution is it a

735
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,960
company contribution and so on and so

736
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,790
forth and then you know the whole

737
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,690
process around getting the approval that

738
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:36,190
was rather painful as well so you know

739
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,960
there we implemented a backup but

740
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,460
ultimately it wasn't in it that leads me

741
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,399
to the third story which is all around

742
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,880
unintended consequences of mixing well

743
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,080
I'm not going to read this out I'm just

744
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,260
going to talk about GPL and you know use

745
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,200
it as a synonym for GPL or NL GPL

746
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,020
version X only you know which means that

747
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,630
you take the license and you remove the

748
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,450
and or later in brackets and specify a

749
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,380
specific license and you know the

750
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,310
variant of the GPL very leave this in so

751
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,170
you remember that dragon blood blood

752
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,510
tree and a company well part of that

753
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,630
whole approval process meant you know

754
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,340
besides the lysis reviewed added a

755
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,760
patent review as well and the company

756
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,820
was rather sensitive towards patents and

757
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,950
gplv3 and basically they said well if

758
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,470
you have any gplv3 code in your code

759
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,940
base we're not going to contribute to

760
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,000
you full stop but then I discovered that

761
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,980
we had a number of files which were

762
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,300
marked GPL v3 or later in a project and

763
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,700
and because you can take those files and

764
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,260
copy it into another GPL v3 project that

765
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,330
basically said well that may mean that

766
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,860
we can't actually contribute to your

767
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,020
project right and I didn't really

768
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,550
understand this very well you know this

769
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,170
was something which was relatively new

770
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,220
to me and I was really surprised that we

771
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,230
had you know files like this in the code

772
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,480
base as well so I kinda was asking why

773
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,690
did we actually have GPL v2 cup plus you

774
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,360
know what GPL B 2 or later code in our

775
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,400
code base was it a conscious decision

776
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,970
you know how much is there and actually

777
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,640
turned out that this was purely

778
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,670
accidental because people would just go

779
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,760
to the FSF website right and copy the

780
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,070
license template and at license a

781
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,010
template says GPL v2 in brackets or

782
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,120
later right

783
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,470
and then I copied that into the code

784
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,200
base and you know we had no mechanism in

785
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,090
place to really prevent that or look at

786
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,790
it you know it was just something which

787
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,520
happened and actually then I asked

788
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,660
myself is to specific to us right do

789
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,790
other projects also trip over this and

790
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,190
you know as for projects I listed

791
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,690
earlier they all have GPL v2 code so I

792
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,270
was asking the question how much GPL v2

793
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,180
or later code do they have so what is

794
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,340
the proportion of their GPL v2 car

795
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,250
which is actually mark gplv2 or later

796
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,000
and you know the next 14% QB 9 7 project

797
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,380
10 you know FreeBSD 32 so that really

798
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,870
implies that there's actually you know

799
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,760
there's not a lot of knowledge about

800
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,460
that and not a lot of what this might

801
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,760
actually mean right so what did we do so

802
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,590
first question is can we actually go and

803
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,080
fix this right so so I looked at this

804
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,820
and it didn't really seem to be a

805
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,570
precedence and it wasn't really a lot of

806
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,490
clear Ghana guidance on how you would

807
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,110
deal with you know changing these

808
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,790
licenses would you have to go through a

809
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,410
food process and ask everyone for

810
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,200
approval and so I started to talk to

811
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,110
lawyers about this but at the same time

812
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,270
we also started to I started to talk to

813
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,070
key community comeback members and

814
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,290
actually it became clear that this was

815
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,420
potentially a very divisive issue so I

816
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,350
didn't want to go there so then we

817
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,730
thought about this I'm baiting you said

818
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,800
well we have this problem right now

819
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,730
let's just not make it worse right so

820
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,700
the first thing we did is when I entered

821
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,370
templates license header templates which

822
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,760
don't have the or later in it for all

823
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,110
our GPL and LGPL code we've raised

824
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,150
awareness amongst committees and

825
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,160
maintained us to make sure that I picked

826
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,330
this up and ultimately in this

827
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,970
particular case the issue went away

828
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,870
because you know I did some of this

829
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,910
research and could point out to the

830
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,490
lawyers that actually by the way some of

831
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,560
those projects you already contribute to

832
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,350
and you've given you know your engineers

833
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,660
approval to contribute they have exactly

834
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,730
the same issues as as we why do you

835
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,800
treat us differently than those other

836
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,610
projects so the issue went away but

837
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,340
obviously it means it may mean you know

838
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,000
that that company has instructed their

839
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,980
staff maybe not to contribute to files

840
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,860
which are labeled gplv3 plus we don't

841
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,750
know or there might be other companies

842
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,820
who've been through this process and

843
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,980
haven't talked to us who just looked at

844
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,570
our code base and decided not to

845
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,589
contribute for that reason right

846
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:34,770
so fundamentally does a slightly bigger

847
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,819
issue hidden behind there right around

848
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:45,170
this GPL B X only or later issue so

849
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,450
basically you know if you're this is our

850
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,220
case right if you're a version two only

851
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,680
project and you allow version two or

852
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,559
later files well you could scare away

853
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:07,289
some contributors if you're a LGPL B 2

854
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:10,079
or later project and you allow you know

855
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,359
files which are specific to a specific

856
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,089
version in your codebase well you're

857
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:17,039
actually then diminishing your

858
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,710
capability to upgrade your codebase your

859
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,930
new version at some later point in the

860
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,450
future so really what this means if you

861
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,799
do the one or other you should have

862
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:32,160
mechanism in place to enforce that your

863
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,930
codebase stays pure because otherwise

864
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,329
you end up with supposed you know was

865
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:38,460
the worst of both worlds you may be able

866
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,650
to not you may not be able to upgrade

867
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,130
and you may you know scare away yeah I

868
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,410
know I only have two slides left so I'm

869
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,700
so basically you may end up with the

870
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,680
most of you know worst of both worlds

871
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,910
and if you look at all those big

872
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,700
projects beforehand that's the de facto

873
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,230
situation we are in right now so just

874
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,349
wanted to summarize some of the key best

875
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:07,730
practices and lessons we learned is

876
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,230
really if you want to stay similar

877
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,829
license a single license project you

878
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,049
need some tooling or some processes to

879
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,150
actually enforce that because if you

880
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,680
don't really what happens is you know

881
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,809
the law of entropy comes in and by

882
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,710
default you become mixed license the

883
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,000
sames true you know if you're basically

884
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,970
LGPL VX only or or later project you

885
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,160
probably want to have some tooling in

886
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,170
place or some mechanisms in place to

887
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,029
avoid a mixture of those two

888
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:48,010
if you are happy you know if you do use

889
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,049
multiple licenses you probably want to

890
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,750
document license exceptions in

891
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,910
particular you know the rules around it

892
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,579
your conventions you know rationale for

893
00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:00,099
license is exceptions for particular

894
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,859
instances you probably also want to

895
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:05,109
provide copyright templates for the

896
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:08,859
common licenses you use you probably

897
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,230
want to have some mechanism to to record

898
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,930
imports from other code bases in a

899
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,079
consistent manner and that for all

900
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,200
imports into your code base and you

901
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,910
probably want to have some conventions

902
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,809
around you know what does it mean if

903
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,640
somebody you know around company and

904
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,599
personal sign-off particularly if you

905
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,170
use a TCL I mean the same issue was kind

906
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,030
of raised in a previous talk around

907
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,680
contributor agreements and basically

908
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,140
TCL's kind of have the same issue in

909
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,150
many ways but that usually isn't very

910
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,700
well documented anywhere any of those

911
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,140
projects which you see SEOs and you know

912
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,210
plan for the future if you introduce

913
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,059
your component new components think

914
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:05,200
about it with with licensing spectacles

915
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,190
on and what somebody might want to do in

916
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,650
the future and then you know adapt

917
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,230
maybe the license accordingly such that

918
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,910
you don't have to realizes it and go

919
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,500
through this pain at some later stage

920
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,779
and that's it so I'm I'm hoping to take

921
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:26,049
some questions it's somebody maybe gonna

922
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,150
yeah but we'll start there that somebody

923
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,650
has a microphone yeah

924
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,619
so my question was I saw that you

925
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,089
recording it but your according to the

926
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:43,309
readme those sources like markdown kind

927
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:45,739
of fowl now it's just a text file right

928
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:48,109
I mean we could use something more

929
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:50,869
sophisticated right yeah so my question

930
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,640
is why didn't you use SP DX because I

931
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,140
actually have to look at your project

932
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,880
now I little sneak that it was written

933
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,089
down yeah but we have got a machine with

934
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:03,170
it well SPD X tells you you know you can

935
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,539
make any it doesn't allow you does it

936
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:07,549
allow easily to record where licenses

937
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:10,549
come from if you imported coal yes you

938
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:12,380
get their license comments to it so it's

939
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,459
there I mean so the reasons I actually

940
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:19,670
wanted to use SPD X right but there's

941
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,309
some some of the key people in the

942
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:24,709
project have issues with SPD X for

943
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,299
whatever reason so I couldn't actually

944
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:27,319
get that through

945
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,569
unfortunately so right we should talk

946
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,249
and figure out what does these are that

947
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:34,009
we can fix it yeah I actually I might

948
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:35,779
get you in touch with the guy who's

949
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:39,829
particularly objecting spds

950
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:45,920
yeah there was one further down Thanks

951
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,859
what if the company that hold that 15

952
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,880
line codebase had closed down is that a

953
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,429
problem or that's better

954
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,989
what we could did get approval in the

955
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,160
end right but if we haven't what that

956
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,900
improve all we basically would have it

957
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,509
would have technically been a problem

958
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:12,259
because you know 15 lines are still our

959
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:18,259
key right and we couldn't not a company

960
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:20,390
actually existed so we managed to track

961
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,779
them down

962
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,650
I have no idea that's a that's an

963
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,309
interesting question right I mean

964
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:31,989
typically you have maybe a company who

965
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:33,999
buys them and you can find somebody but

966
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:36,759
if somebody maybe have to find the

967
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:39,069
individuals who worked on that I'm not a

968
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,749
lawyer so that would be a question for

969
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:42,279
one of the lawyers in a room what do you

970
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:45,749
do in that case right I don't know a

971
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:52,599
question up there one more and that's it

972
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,930
yeah

973
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,490
[Music]

974
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,830
I think I know yellow t-shirt

975
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,770
all right okay so find me afterwards

976
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,320
thank you for joining the talk

977
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:31,489
[Applause]
