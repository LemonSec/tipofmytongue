1
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,769
okay

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,600
thank you my name is Chris Leben I'm a

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,790
Debian developer and I'm talking about

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,410
multimedia assets that are licensed

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,640
under the GNU General Public License and

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,529
why am I giving this talk today well as

7
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,750
a Debian developer I package some

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,260
software including a few games and there

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,580
were two games called

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,629
blow parts and Starfighter that I

11
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,739
packaged for Debian and all as well for

12
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,870
some time and then suddenly someone

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,860
found out hey this game it's in the

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,720
Debian main repository so it should be

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,580
all free and open source and so on but

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,369
there's some music and images that are

17
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,500
being used in the game and they are

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,130
actually not free and then we can talk

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,990
about what is free and not freely about

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,720
it was so bad that there were some there

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,400
was some music for example that

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,320
explicity had a copyright a that it said

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,460
all rights reserved

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,610
nothing so you didn't have any license

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,710
to spread around the music for example

26
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,660
as a big problem if you have this in a

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,010
distribution because you are spreading

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,780
it around so you're liable then so I

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,720
started walking together with my wife to

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,440
replace music and sound for these games

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,270
from free sources

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,250
nowadays you can get many creative

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,820
commons-licensed multimedia from like

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,409
open game art so torque it's a nice

35
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:51,500
website but the game engines are usually

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,050
written well they're licensed under the

37
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,080
GPL it's very cool so I thought why not

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,830
use the TPL for the multimedia as well

39
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,830
so

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm an outline of the talk I will talk

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,610
about about the GPL itself and then what

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,740
what we have to think about when you GPL

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,160
multimedia I will give you an example of

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,400
some GPL music and then we'll give some

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,050
conclusions but first I will tell you

46
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,620
why do we want to use the GPL as license

47
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,670
it's very nice because it ensures first

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,760
everybody can spread around your work

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,640
and they can use it freely it's a very

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,930
basic thing

51
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,720
second of all everybody is allowed to

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
make changes and redistribute them so

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,950
they can fix bugs they can add features

54
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,750
they can help out in other ways and and

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,290
spread out their results but what's also

56
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,120
very nice is that the GPL enforces

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,620
people who do this to to dispute their

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,260
change sources and at the same license

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,100
so it's not that these nice properties

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,910
where the first two are taken away so

61
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,160
there are the licenses for example ABC

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
license maybe even Creative Commons by

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,500
license that allow you to take a work

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,040
modify it and then give the result of

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
that but not give the original sources

66
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,629
back to the community

67
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,079
and the reason why we have these

68
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,209
properties is what I already said is

69
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,799
that the source code must be made

70
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,430
available okay now we think ok his

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,019
source goes what is source code I know

72
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,519
source code for programs that let's have

73
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,220
a look at GPL license and I've taken two

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,819
small pieces out of it

75
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,379
the first is the definitional for the

76
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,980
source code so if you have a work then

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,379
the source code is the preferred form of

78
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,340
the work for making modifications to it

79
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,540
so if I'm making an image and I have I

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,730
do it in Inkscape for example of some

81
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,389
vector graphics program then as the

82
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,880
designer of some of the image the vector

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,579
graphics is the source code whereas the

84
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,300
object code or any monster on source

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,789
form to work is any result you create

86
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,320
from this for example if you export your

87
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,560
vector graphics as a bitmap image then

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,909
that is a long source form to work a

89
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:40,000
major it says that you also have

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,750
corresponding source code for work

91
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,770
meaning everything that you need to

92
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,150
generate install run modify the things

93
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,860
that you do because if for example you

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,599
make an image you have some vector

95
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,419
graphics in this SVG but if Inkscape

96
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,830
itself would not be a free software then

97
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,810
it's certainly very difficult for for me

98
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,460
to pass this to someone else and have

99
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,590
them have the ability to change your

100
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,099
vector graphics so everything you need

101
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:14,710
to go from source code to end result

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,310
should be free as well and the fair we

103
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,220
have this source code available for that

104
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,210
so okay now we have this definition of a

105
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,380
source code for an GPL how can we apply

106
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,320
this to multimedia so it's actually very

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,600
easy you just have to make the preferred

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
form of notification available yet

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,010
ensure that the file final project

110
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,770
product can be made with free and open

111
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,480
source products so you have to include

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,890
all the scripts and tools that you use

113
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,740
to make final products so that's it easy

114
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,580
right well then you start thinking and

115
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,270
think well let's say I have an image I

116
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,130
took with my camera from some scene

117
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,590
outside what is the source of that is

118
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,950
that the scene outside well no no no we

119
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,440
we are only concerned with the digital

120
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,020
world so once you take the image the

121
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,500
image file that your camera produces is

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,250
the source the same thing if music for

123
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,780
example if you make a recording of a

124
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,550
live band and you get permission from

125
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,980
them to redistribute your work under the

126
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,020
GPL for example then the recording is

127
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,620
the source and not the band themselves

128
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,160
we also don't require perfect fidelity

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,510
if you think oh I have the source code

130
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,970
it must be the the originals that you

131
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,890
think well if I take an image if my

132
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,669
camera should it be the wrong order

133
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,120
JPEGs if you have music should it be the

134
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,490
original WAV files or maybe the flat

135
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,940
compressed lossless compressed sound or

136
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
can I just dispute a note for this file

137
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,770
well we don't really care that much as

138
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,730
long as you can still modify it in a

139
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,140
very easy way we also don't require the

140
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:15,850
whole history think if you you take some

141
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,480
detailed work from someone else like

142
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,790
they they made movie example and you

143
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,880
just want one frame from this movie

144
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,750
because you want to use this as the

145
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,730
backdrop for your game for example so

146
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,380
you have to include the whole movie as

147
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,070
the source code for your game

148
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,640
no it's it's fine to take an excerpt of

149
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,090
a larger work you don't have to have to

150
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,280
hold a new history for example of some

151
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,820
file because then it would quickly

152
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,340
become unreasonable so use common sense

153
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,350
in doubt you can look at how we do it

154
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,590
for source code of programs because we

155
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,610
have so much experience with that and

156
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,930
then some things that you should not do

157
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,360
outweigh is that one

158
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,860
Sorry Sorry first some examples of

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,229
source code so for images if you have a

160
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,210
vector art then for example the SVG

161
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,509
files can be either the source files if

162
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,990
you have a pixel art then try if you use

163
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,030
the game for example you have the native

164
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,110
 file format xcf which preserves all

165
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,270
the layers that you have and and things

166
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,659
like that if you have a computer

167
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,969
rendered art then for example you if you

168
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,370
make it in blender or Pro Frey then use

169
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,830
all the source files for these programs

170
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,720
if you have photographs then of course

171
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,310
it's preferable if you have the raw

172
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,380
files because you can do much more of

173
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,420
them if this is the preferred way of

174
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,660
working with it as you as an artist and

175
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,390
yes this is definitely the source

176
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,950
otherwise I mean there are class for

177
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,450
example that cannot produce RAW files

178
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,790
and an original JPEGs are fine as well

179
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,280
for sounding music well if you have for

180
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,370
example a band that is playing a number

181
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,140
then you have different microphones and

182
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,510
so on you do a multitrack recording then

183
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,430
you would say okay it's maybe all the

184
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,900
original tracks that is the source

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,930
because that is what you then work on

186
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,270
you mix everything together you get

187
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,930
things as one but nowadays a lot of

188
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,590
music is made on computers so you have

189
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,540
so for synthesizers you have sample

190
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,110
libraries and so on so this is what is

191
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,940
the source if you have a food digital

192
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Linux audio workstation setup there are

193
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,650
some files that describe how all your

194
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,030
components are linked together and how

195
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,610
they pure sound this is what is to be

196
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,110
included a source code

197
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,580
but then you think okay for example you

198
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,700
said I have a multitrack audio recording

199
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,190
well this can easily be many gigabytes

200
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,010
of data if you have a movie this is even

201
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,820
more so sometimes you think oh this is

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,370
too big to distribute or sometimes it

203
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,440
will take a very long time - for example

204
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,230
render a movie that this will take

205
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,920
months on a computer cluster for example

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,029
then try to find some reasonable

207
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,850
solutions to solve this problem one of

208
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,440
them for example is that you can make

209
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,420
use of the written offer clause of the

210
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,790
GPL that says oh you don't have to

211
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,520
really always make the source available

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,130
online but you can also make an offer

213
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,100
available for someone to get the source

214
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,150
from you for a reasonable cost so if you

215
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,580
have gigabytes of data then you can say

216
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,210
okay I can give you a CD via post office

217
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,330
post system for example maybe if it's

218
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,790
computationally money can point them to

219
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,860
the company or Institute where you

220
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,690
render to stuff so then they also have

221
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,870
the ability to go there and do the same

222
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,390
thing you did pay some money and have

223
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,820
them render for example your files and

224
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,120
now I will give an example Oh Oh what

225
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,630
not to do

226
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,770
yeah that's first so you should not

227
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,170
provide source code in and proprietary

228
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,140
format I've seen a documentation for

229
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,870
example for an open source project where

230
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,360
the documentation was written in Word

231
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,949
well nowadays we have OpenOffice which

232
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,779
can maybe read it but this is not really

233
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,899
the preferred thing also don't do

234
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,230
anything that requires proprietary

235
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,329
programs to process so you have maybe

236
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,170
open standards file formats but and the

237
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,639
tools actually make use of them are

238
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
notes free

239
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,939
avoid using a commercial font for

240
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,819
example or image in sound libraries for

241
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:14,089
which you have to pay to get it and also

242
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,670
what I've seen sometimes is that people

243
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,610
say ah I made some music with some

244
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,379
software synthesizers and I have the

245
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:26,120
core base file as a result and yeah now

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,250
you want the original source files no

247
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,500
because I say the oak forest files are

248
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,430
the source

249
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,700
it's not the preferred form of

250
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,810
notification so that's a bit strange so

251
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,400
if you think about doing anything of the

252
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,410
buff then maybe the GPL is not for you

253
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,450
but I will give you an example of how to

254
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,840
write music that can be detailed because

255
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,400
we have the source code available and

256
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,680
also I made this myself and I'm more of

257
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,260
a programmer so while you could

258
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,480
perfectly do it with graphical user

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
interfaces the Rose Garden for example

260
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,170
to to write your score and to render its

261
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,360
fear so for synthesizer I decided well

262
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
can you also write music completely with

263
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,820
a text editor so I will give three

264
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,940
slides and any slides I will show you

265
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,230
the complete source code of a piece of

266
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,010
music and I'll try to play it as well I

267
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,660
used some components because I have some

268
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,150
compilers I'm going from ABC MIDI of a

269
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,850
music notation format to a MIDI file I

270
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,870
use C sound to as a software synthesizer

271
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,240
to render the MIDI file I use the fluid

272
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,660
synth library and the general MIDI sound

273
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,370
phones for samples I process the

274
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,770
resulting war file to a node for this

275
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,080
file I use a make file script to

276
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,840
automate everything and I have two

277
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,330
resulting object codes from this source

278
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,660
code it's the soundtrack itself but I

279
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,230
also get a PDF with the sheet music so

280
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,080
what does it look like oh this is the

281
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,210
score of a small song I made I don't

282
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,270
have that much time but if you can look

283
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,130
at it you see you have like bar notation

284
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,720
more or less you have letters from 8

285
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,490
through G for the note and some number

286
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,040
stayed in are durations of notes

287
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,200
so this is my music notation and then

288
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,800
this is my C sound software what is it

289
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,490
super synthesize the definition it's

290
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,070
also very short because I cheat a little

291
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,370
bit

292
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,380
normally you can build complex

293
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,330
instruments from scratch from this but

294
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,070
actually I using the fluid sound film

295
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,520
engine that you slowed some samples and

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,650
uses that to render the music and then I

297
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,290
have a makefile that automates

298
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,410
everything

299
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,110
and one of the products that the

300
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,170
makefile makes is the PDF files with the

301
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,420
sheet music that's for example this

302
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,830
but now I will try to give a

303
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,460
demonstration

304
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,679
[Music]

305
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,050
so a directory is one makefile

306
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,010
actually have two songs but let's just

307
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,339
build it

308
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:18,090
don't so let's see if the sound works

309
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,210
[Music]

310
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,620
take care forwards

311
00:16:25,620 --> 00:17:00,110
[Music]

312
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,269
[Applause]

313
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,859
I'll play another one in the background

314
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,290
that's much younger one but

315
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,699
unfortunately the source code if that

316
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,910
one was too big for the slides so so

317
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,920
these this music was made for a game

318
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,809
space game where you fly around in a

319
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,459
Starfighter and have to shoot down the

320
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,890
bodies so this was a nice example can

321
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,950
you find more examples of this online

322
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,440
well I'm afraid I couldn't find that

323
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,420
much which is actually licensed under

324
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,330
the GPL but there's a lot of not media

325
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,030
around with source code so the bender

326
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,900
projects for example organized this

327
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,429
mountain every few years they they

328
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:58,030
create a movie and they make available

329
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,100
all the sources for this movie so you

330
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,559
can recreate it yourself or you can make

331
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,580
changes to it

332
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,850
Bopha is a ray tracer they have a

333
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,889
gallery where people can submit their

334
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,019
source code and you can see the rendered

335
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,070
image there's a website called shader

336
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,609
toys

337
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:20,960
I think where people program Open GL

338
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,899
shaders and have that produce nice

339
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,519
images and everything runs in the

340
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,200
browser I just have a look at it

341
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,169
tracker modules so for music that is

342
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,999
very interesting because tracker modules

343
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,249
are their own source code it's basically

344
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:41,059
a combination of the music note score

345
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,549
and some samples and some fixed set of

346
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:45,889
rules to play it and I guess there are

347
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,309
many more examples and hopefully this

348
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,559
will inspire you to produce some

349
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,629
detailed notes media of Europe and then

350
00:18:53,629 --> 00:19:04,519
I look forward to seeing it so final

351
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,210
what it's certainly possible and even if

352
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,229
you are not a person who is used to

353
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:15,259
multimedia the way artists make it then

354
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,809
there are still ways to make them make

355
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,070
music and images in a programmer cell

356
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,939
okay thank you

357
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,470
no no so I've been playing keyboards and

358
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,910
piano since I was five years old or so I

359
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,240
wrote programs to produce music um in

360
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,940
basic when I was very young

361
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,620
even so the question was is this the

362
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,440
first time I rock music so no but this

363
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,200
is actually the first time I wrote it so

364
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,890
as source code this way so

365
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,860
Oh

366
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,830
yeah so that's a good question

367
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,050
what if my source code is very big I

368
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,450
have this I can make use of this class

369
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,960
to make it only available upon request

370
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,510
but then all my hard disk Quest and I

371
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,540
lost all my sources yeah this has

372
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,720
happened before there are examples out

373
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,990
there of people who get this and then

374
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,660
yeah you cannot fulfill your promise

375
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,480
anymore but you are a copyright holder

376
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,390
so you're a bit special but anybody else

377
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,750
who has your end results and want to

378
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,400
reduce the victim under the same license

379
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,450
they now have a problem in that case I

380
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,140
would say okay go to the original author

381
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:19,040
and yeah you make the result available

382
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,990
under different license I mean then it's

383
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,330
maybe the cc-by license or maybe perfect

384
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,860
domain because then there's not much

385
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,760
else that you can do so I have a

386
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
question about the

387
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,790
is there a relationship between GPL and

388
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,530
Creative Commons or are they completely

389
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,220
separate yeah the question is it's a

390
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,900
relationship between a GPL on the

391
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,710
Creative Commons I think what the GPL

392
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,330
was very old already

393
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,740
but the CC by-sa license

394
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,250
shared alike and attribution license is

395
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,160
the most similar to the GPL and I think

396
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,190
it is inspired by people who already

397
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,929
know the GPL I wanted something similar

398
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,450
any Creative Commons the only problem if

399
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,220
it is that it doesn't make a distinction

400
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,900
between source code and object code so

401
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,340
it's easy to make some music and publish

402
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,890
the mp3 files under the CC by-sa license

403
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,900
but you cannot really modify it anymore

404
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,820
maybe you can make cut something or

405
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,210
change the pitch or that's it but you

406
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,530
cannot change some chords in the middle

407
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,520
of the song for example

408
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,240
if the Creative Commons licenses are

409
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,960
more related to intellectual property no

410
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,660
I I wouldn't say so

411
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,790
at least not more or less than the GPL

412
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:58,410
is so yeah so if let's say our artists

413
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,530
and our aquatic critters you saw

414
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,020
proprietary tools for maybe like tile

415
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,030
sets they knew they

416
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,470
short of extracting those assets and

417
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,240
repository of like height them is there

418
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,990
any other way we can

419
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,380
in some way

420
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,159
yeah so the question is if you have

421
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,610
artists who use proprietary libraries or

422
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,149
software to produce end results it's the

423
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:36,200
is the way to extract everything you

424
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,860
need so as someone who receives the work

425
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,809
that you can still do everything that

426
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,749
your original artist did that's hard to

427
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,739
say because there are many libraries

428
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:51,289
with samples for example or images out

429
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,690
there with clip art that say okay you

430
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,369
you can use this in your work if you pay

431
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,950
for it but you're not allowed to reduce

432
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,269
with the the library itself without any

433
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:07,460
changes and actually maybe you really

434
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,619
want to have the original library to be

435
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,090
able to do the same thing that original

436
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,320
artist did but maybe there are

437
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,119
situations where indeed you can use

438
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,330
excerpts from this library and make them

439
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,100
available under the GPL I don't know

440
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,359
this is a case-by-case thing

441
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,928
I would say

442
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,049
particular instances it's a tent party

443
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,440
like you will have your artists

444
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,960
yes yes that's a good question and I

445
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,340
want to say something about that as well

446
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,350
so what if you have artists they are

447
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,440
used to their proprietary tools how can

448
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,630
you convince them to switch to some free

449
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,400
tools while some of them might want to

450
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,940
do it but one thing is that it's not

451
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,350
always the case that if they use

452
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,110
proprietary tools that you cannot just

453
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,190
read it as under the GPL because maybe

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,600
they are free tools that can do exactly

455
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,520
the same thing and then it's not the

456
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,530
problem I mean if some point somebody

457
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,960
does something a Photoshop then someone

458
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,510
else can most likely edit everything in

459
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,570
a very nice convenient way in the game

460
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,000
for example maybe not everything but

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,540
maybe it's good enough

462
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,629
you
