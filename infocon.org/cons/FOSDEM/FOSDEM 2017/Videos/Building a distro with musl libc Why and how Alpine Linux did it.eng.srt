1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,910
hi everyone I am NOT Anacapa I work with

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,590
Alpine Linux I work for dr. right now

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,000
and that we'll talk a little bit about

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,359
muscle Ipsy

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,970
so how many of you have used Alpine

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,610
Linux one way or the other that's cool

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,260
how many of you have used cell plant for

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,969
more than five years some of you cool

10
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:49,969
ten years good very good

11
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,879
okay and the screen looks nice

12
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,600
I see so a little design about alpine

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,539
linux it was designed to run without

14
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,310
harddisc that was the basic idea so we

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,630
boot up install the system in ram memory

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,409
and you could take out the boot media if

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,220
you want it that means that you want the

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,650
system to be very small you don't want

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,710
to blow the system that was the original

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,880
idea so use cases was like firewalls

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,979
VPNs and that but nowadays it's very

22
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,570
popular food containers docker who win

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,290
how many you use docker good good I

24
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,540
think it makes very much sense to run

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,479
Alpine within containers because of you

26
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,210
know when you run from RAM you install

27
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,610
it boots up and you destroy it when you

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,920
power it down that's pretty similar what

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,890
you do in a container disposable systems

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,740
right

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,699
let's move on

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,460
we started with the Gentoo so we built

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,920
Alpine region - originally and then we

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,200
moved on it to make it self hosting

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,450
what's interesting is we use you slip

36
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,370
see how many is familiar with you slips

37
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,690
in good so we use that originally

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,010
busybox is a core thing and in 2013 we

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,470
had the last release with you slip see

40
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,180
at that time we had almost 3,000 ports

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,860
2800 and just we won there was some

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,110
problems we used slips in they require

43
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,570
some patches to get it upstream patches

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,630
upstream we had at that time I think 39

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,000
patches and we cannot get them upstream

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,310
one important thing was threading issue

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,640
you slip see we'll see crashed or

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,600
actually it Hank

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,489
every time we exited due to threading

50
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,830
implementation it was not really fixable

51
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,160
so we thought we need to move on also

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,900
the code base is really ugly sorry to

53
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,810
say that but it it's because it comes

54
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,950
from asian system AG Lipsy so it was not

55
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,790
really nice to work with so we saw this

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,820
muscle obscene thing and on the website

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,459
it says it's new that's cool it's

58
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,680
lightweight it's simple and it's correct

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,170
when it comes to security so it matches

60
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,530
pretty well with the goes with Alpine

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,989
there's an active development clean nice

62
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,860
codebase stable ABI you slip C doesn't

63
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,280
have that

64
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,019
they also provide some sort of APA

65
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,170
compatibility with you know Lipsy

66
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,280
actually the Adobe Flash Player works in

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,670
with mass livesey in an alpinist so so

68
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,180
it kind of works so that was some of the

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,849
nice things from a city so of course

70
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,440
there was some worries because not many

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,680
distros has done this before build

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,910
complete this show with I must live

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,580
scene so how much would break of a big

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,449
question we how much work was it to

75
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,020
patch things would upstream accept

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,060
patches important questions

77
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,780
it's not as mature as can you live see

78
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,570
so how many hidden bugs are there but we

79
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,500
didn't know about we were worried about

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,710
that but switching to G Lipsy was not

81
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,590
really an option so we so we decided to

82
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,740
just jump and how did it go

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,920
surprisingly well it's like yeah I think

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,190
it's about four percent that was a

85
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,900
specific muscle base we have more

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,860
patches but not many patches actually to

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,160
make it work most of it just works I

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,900
just move on because over time so some

89
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,200
of the nice things we must live see

90
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,170
experiences we had with Muslims is that

91
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,500
the code is very nice we did some

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,630
changes some ellipses submitted patches

93
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,260
upstream very nice work with nice

94
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,990
community they try to be correct

95
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,750
sometimes that can be a bit annoying

96
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,000
because you just want to move on you

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,830
have a real-world application that

98
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,490
breaks and you ask them and say hey why

99
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,850
don't we just you know and as you know

100
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,530
we don't

101
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,100
and it can be annoying you know but in

102
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,950
most cases that is actually good and and

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,430
I am thankful to the muscle community

104
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,900
that they are strict with that and an

105
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,850
interesting thing I noticed when we

106
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,160
patch software to make it work with mas

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,110
Lipsy almost always the code gets better

108
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,420
and and I will show some experiences

109
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,160
with that an upstream always always

110
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,190
almost always they will accept patches

111
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,270
to support because it's we send a pass

112
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,780
this breaks POSIX and they will just

113
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,520
accept it there are a few exceptions

114
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,450
they

115
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:56,699
yeah that's true systemd is one of them

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,330
so if you want to do go this road what

117
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,370
do you need to watch out for if you have

118
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,810
an application that you want to build

119
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,550
with muslim see what what are the things

120
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,520
you need to watch out for

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,250
there is no define muscle defined you

122
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,740
cannot say you cannot test in your C

123
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,680
code this runs on a muscle system you

124
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,610
cannot do that that to default stack

125
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,820
size is 80 K there are some extensions

126
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,599
in print format strings there is no lazy

127
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,539
binding and there is one very nasty

128
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,789
thing there if you want to print error

129
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,370
messages and the dns resolver will take

130
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,919
them one by one so there is no muscle

131
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,250
define this is a patch from Mesa we got

132
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,759
upstream and they test oh if you run

133
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,030
they did that before if you run Apple

134
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,310
system or if you run FreeBSD NetBSD

135
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,659
OpenBSD if you run Android bla bla bla

136
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:06,219
then you do that like this imagine if

137
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,320
the world actually was a muscle define

138
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,120
what do you think would happen with the

139
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,250
code here so because of they don't have

140
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,800
that define they just say okay you know

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,039
what if you are not an exception just

142
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,590
assume you're following the standard and

143
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,000
then you can just remove all this

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,210
garbage and the code gets better that's

145
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,109
proper way to do it

146
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,059
another problem is the the stack.size

147
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,250
80k windows I think you have one

148
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,940
megabytes

149
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,240
open Beasties 256 K maybe previously 512

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
depending a bit on the architecture G

151
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,200
Lipsy default stack size for threads is

152
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:58,460
8 megabytes so if if you spawn 10

153
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,520
threads and G Lipsy system it will just

154
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,180
use 80 megabytes doing nothing

155
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,740
this one is actually the smallest one I

156
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,880
know default stack size we had an

157
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,950
interesting patch in Firefox if you see

158
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,460
a tear out buffer K out size how big is

159
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,560
that buffer that ends up in the stack

160
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,380
what do you think happen if you try to

161
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,890
allocate 128 K or when you only have 80

162
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,449
K goes boom

163
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,560
so so Firefox started to crash in this

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,080
this was the issue but I want to search

165
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,990
the bugzilla for Firefox I actually

166
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,950
found another bug on Windows which has

167
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,460
one megabyte stack size they crashed for

168
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,440
the same reason so generally you don't

169
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,920
do that you don't allocate 128 K on the

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,890
stack that's that's it just don't do it

171
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,330
you know that's kind of kind of stupid

172
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,450
thing to do so they accepted the patch I

173
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,450
think this went upstream you don't see

174
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,450
it but they will allocate it on the

175
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:22,590
hippie instead there are some issues

176
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,570
with the format strings in general just

177
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,360
read the man page you will see so see

178
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,810
something like this GDG provides some

179
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,810
extensions if you see that pay attention

180
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,140
because if you use those extensions it

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,020
may work it may not work you have no

182
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,570
guarantee that it will work it may work

183
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,660
on a recent Muslims in it maybe doesn't

184
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,370
probably will not work an older Muslim

185
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,040
see so so pay attention on the water man

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,130
page say watch out for the extensions

187
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,709
and we will take look at this one this

188
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,170
one is really nasty so you have this

189
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,529
function to print error message can you

190
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,570
guys see a problem with the two

191
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,730
different versions up there one returns

192
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,120
an integer we had one returns the string

193
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,820
how do you know which one do you have if

194
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,540
you have a precompiled binary and you

195
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,700
want to be a bi compatible

196
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,420
how do you know which one you get you

197
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,060
cannot really know that actually so so

198
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,589
that's kind of annoying you shouldn't

199
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,980
really use this try to avoid it if if

200
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,089
possible I will see I will show you a

201
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,899
patch that is from VMware not not too

202
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,019
old actually a VM open-vm-tools crashed

203
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,800
and the reason was they test that if

204
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,680
you're running on Linux then use the

205
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,519
jelly PC version you know and at some

206
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,100
point someone find out that on some

207
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,990
platform nlm I don't know what that is

208
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,720
but probably they it runs on Linux right

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,230
and all Android also runs on Linux so

210
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,750
they you know added different test forms

211
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,459
the real fix is check for the extension

212
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,860
the exception and if you are not the

213
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,740
exception assume the standard behavior

214
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,060
that that's the fix for that

215
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,300
how are we I'm having time I'm gonna

216
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,490
mean it's Oh down I don't need to stress

217
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,120
thank you

218
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,310
another issue you may have noticed

219
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,680
already is the DNS resolver the main

220
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,830
page says how things work muscle doesn't

221
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,020
work the way the main page say you need

222
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,360
to be aware of that so if you have this

223
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,980
in this example what would you expect

224
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,110
you might expect that it will first ask

225
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,800
the 192 server and after that go to the

226
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,130
next one and muscle it see it does not

227
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,480
do that it will actually send a request

228
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,790
to all of them and their first one

229
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,970
responding will will have the answer so

230
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,850
you might get surprises there on the

231
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,690
upside you get faster resolving right

232
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,690
but there there are also other benefits

233
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,230
during this because then you cannot

234
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,810
assume that you get different responses

235
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,260
from different dinner service if your

236
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,200
software relies on different responses

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,380
on different name servers then you are

238
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,470
likely doing something wrong you

239
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,270
shouldn't be doing that in the first

240
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:25,000
place so so if you if your software runs

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,700
on muscle you see you are doing good if

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,290
it does then you're probably doing

243
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,240
something wrong the same thing with this

244
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,560
search keyword it was ad not too long

245
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,940
ago and ma sleep see if you have this

246
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,740
and you search you do ping foo bar will

247
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,290
you search for fubar example.com

248
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,560
will you or not depends a little bit on

249
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,820
your configuration right and and it

250
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,490
depends a little bit on who's giving you

251
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,110
the response but if you rely on that

252
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,430
behavior that you will first search for

253
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,270
one and then the other one what happens

254
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,750
if the bar becomes a tea deal the top

255
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,150
level domain TLD well things may break

256
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,180
right and there are some documents from

257
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,260
from the dns people saying how do you

258
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,190
avoid these kind of conflicts and if you

259
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,780
run muscle ipsy you don't have this

260
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,510
problem if your software runs on Mass

261
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,160
Lipsy and it works you don't have that

262
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,220
problem you can be sure that you always

263
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,690
get the same response

264
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,800
sorry

265
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,980
you have if it will all always only in

266
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,660
search for fubar if you don't get

267
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,700
response on that it will not give you

268
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,140
anything at all it doesn't really work

269
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,820
you can actually add an option and opt

270
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,140
there is an option for it you can do a

271
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,330
configuration option and then it will

272
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,410
always only search for the butiful full

273
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:26,850
name so it will always add the suffix it

274
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,040
will not do both of them either one of

275
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,920
them that can cause some problems so

276
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,820
it's good to be aware of that some

277
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,400
conclusions I have here at the end must

278
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,620
Lipsey I will say it's say ready for the

279
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,720
main line I would say it's already its

280
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,680
main line click on things it works

281
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,110
surprisingly well to build a completely

282
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,300
strobe the most of the things just works

283
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,940
Firefox works we do have some patches

284
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,830
for it

285
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,339
LibreOffice works it will work pretty

286
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,060
well actually

287
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,030
a lot of things works just out of the

288
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,329
box we have a scent hypervisor working

289
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,740
it with the muscle ipsy qmu works we

290
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,829
have a lot of things that just sorry

291
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:31,189
open yes yes works solo at least

292
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,780
and when you need to adjust your

293
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,070
software when you need to patch some

294
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,050
software to make the work we must live

295
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,950
see almost always the code ends up

296
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,740
better so that's kind of nice thing

297
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,870
because it improves the overall code

298
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,550
quality in the open-source community

299
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,680
so my conclusion is master Lipsy is just

300
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,650
awesome do we have any questions here we

301
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,600
have many questions

302
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:23,370
yes why why is jalebi was jalebi not an

303
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,170
option for alpha Linux back at that time

304
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,120
we were running from Ram it was too big

305
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,340
it was just just too big

306
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,520
we didn't want that big and also if we

307
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,160
went to GMC what what difference would

308
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,380
Alpine be from others you know you could

309
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,840
just you could just run a bunt or red

310
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:58,440
hat or whatever you know so yes muscle

311
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:09,860
oopsie yes yes that's a good question

312
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,020
it's muscle ipsy faster than gilepsy

313
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,900
depends on your workload something is

314
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,300
faster some things I expect it's not I

315
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:28,020
don't know really hey I don't know I

316
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,350
really I haven't done much does anybody

317
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,140
know workload where it must live see is

318
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,590
faster than I'm thinking yeah that's a I

319
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,850
believe that

320
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,340
mr. Cuban functions

321
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,780
yes I don't know how up-to-date that is

322
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,990
I think it's pretty old actually but but

323
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,730
there are some main things that are

324
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,590
going to be slow a lack of highly

325
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,540
optimized man coffee sorry

326
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,520
maybe he's known to be slower that it's

327
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,290
highly optimized

328
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,150
okay okay yeah yes

329
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,760
optimized mem copy can be the situation

330
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,300
with a store yes in your example here

331
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,820
you got rid of the reentrant version of

332
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:33,490
stirrer actually it is reentrant even

333
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,440
even this one you mean the one yeah yes

334
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,070
it is but the problem is that you're two

335
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,780
different that they are reentrant they

336
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,840
are exactly the same thing right just

337
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,540
return different things so you may an

338
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,940
end up with one one it was a POSIX

339
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,400
version or you may end up with a G Lipsy

340
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,280
version right and in in the patch its

341
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,210
reentrant C so it's a it should be safe

342
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:13,080
yeah thank you any more questions

343
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:21,740
ah that's a good question because why

344
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:33,380
why we only run in RAM while we don't

345
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,180
actually we support that we see we still

346
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,850
support that so so the live CD will run

347
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,980
from RAM you can in theory boot up to

348
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,830
live CD take out the city and then if

349
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,550
you continue around so it runs it runs

350
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,310
still from from memory but we support

351
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,470
disks now as well so you can assault on

352
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,980
disk as well

353
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:17,350
how much so how much bike shedding how

354
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,970
much trouble is it's a getting a patch

355
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,820
in mass Lipsy in my experience

356
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,879
well the times what I needed a patch in

357
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,330
must live see we had a specific problem

358
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,700
then I have asked them what do you guys

359
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,149
think about that on IRC and normally

360
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,889
it's they who come up with a solution

361
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,889
and then I make the patch but that's the

362
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:44,139
way they do it so so that that has been

363
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:47,529
that has been not not a big issue the

364
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:49,779
times where it can be issues if you want

365
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,909
to hack something do something ugly then

366
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,619
they will say no we don't want to do

367
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,619
that if you have a good reason for it

368
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:03,369
then might accept it but normally it's

369
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,450
not a big problem

370
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,619
in my experience to get patches in there

371
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,220
do we have more time

372
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,420
Medicaid runs sort of

373
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,470
I I don't have much experience with the

374
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,460
OpenJDK so I don't know really I have

375
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,220
heard that you need the dynamic linking

376
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,340
and sorry the lazy loading with that

377
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,500
which doesn't work is not supported we

378
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,450
must live see it's not supported at all

379
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,990
at this point so you might get problems

380
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,820
with it if you if you depend on that but

381
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,510
at least hello world works the

382
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,549
applications I have come from coming to

383
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:56,110
works it may work it may not I don't

384
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,439
know really

385
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,590
the problem with Java is that the Oracle

386
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,419
provides precompiled binaries against G

387
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,370
Lipsy so they only support that if you

388
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,080
do try to do something else it might

389
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,100
work it might not

390
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,669
you can probably pay or ATO to support

391
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,360
must live C but you have to pay them for

392
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,410
it

393
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,529

397
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,930
thank you so most things will work most

398
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:21,130
things will just work shake time time is

399
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,170
out

400
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,310
