1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,390
so so I'm really happy that this works

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,610
now I have the honor of actually like

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,469
having the talk that says okay how to

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:57,210
start using the with myself so I yeah

5
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,239
[Applause]

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,098
[Music]

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,729
[Music]

8
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,390
thank you

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,960
and so the next problem by designing

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,150
your own very application and if there's

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,490
nothing that is already there it's off

12
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,139
your problem how to put your own shoes

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,670
so getting the right is a little bit

14
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,180
challenging of them because well in

15
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
Irenaeus a relatively big project and

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,840
the stuff a lot of these piece table and

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,190
has with your designation said we got

18
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,959
love dependencies and take their desert

19
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,489
really short served and there's a few of

20
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,590
my favorites in there everyone remembers

21
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,860
rift like the only only project in the

22
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,020
world that I don't know anyone will

23
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,540
actually built the full configure

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,959
include all of this thing and there's a

25
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,610
really a lot of problems on many then of

26
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,470
course it's like we're trying to be

27
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,019
cross-platform which means now with

28
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,150
support lives and that means looking all

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,769
the right place for the district the

30
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,890
different different dis terms we also

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:11,540
have a lot of people that work and then

32
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,700
we have Windows which is also popular

33
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,459
platform but not really a well supported

34
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:22,700
platform I yeah I'd say we have kind of

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,220
like Windows development fee is strange

36
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,900
to a lot of us and also all the pegs

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,850
that said in Windows development like

38
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,280
you can't be sure that headers are

39
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,410
somewhere user include us on a similar

40
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,320
stay really strange and and it's making

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,650
it stood out for us but it's working

42
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,910
progress so if you want to help with

43
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,340
that that would be awesome I'm pretty

44
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,049
sure that we can use a lot of help with

45
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,220
that

46
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,609
so what's also changing is that you know

47
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,500
the radio is a software development tool

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,010
kit kind of thing so you might want to

49
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,530
like take a deep dive like like the

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,060
gentleman who asked about a textbook but

51
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,120
actually want to like develop a feature

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,100
with no radio actually fiddling with

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,459
good interior workings and not mess up

54
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,870
his like spread bringer radio that you

55
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,279
- like this HD Hardware % oi huh so this

56
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,260
is this really often they've found the

57
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,639
problem that you actually want to have

58
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,200
different environments on your same

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,970
computer and not always spin up a

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,100
virtual machine just to like you know

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,130
try different personal from well

62
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,010
obviously the optimal solution for for

63
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,050
installing the radius like use your

64
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,550
distro well the district managers they

65
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,440
usually the maintainer step top them and

66
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
they're the education is actually have

67
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,160
to figure out how to build software in a

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,780
way and they can package it and they

69
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,610
always include the right dependencies

70
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,410
and you never end up with something that

71
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,630
doesn't work with the version of library

72
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,030
that's installed so if you can obviously

73
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,530
you normally use a district edge the

74
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,990
reality is like the raiders not only one

75
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,330
project it's like regular then there's

76
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,090
tier ecosystem with a lot of keep

77
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,979
actually just right now three modules

78
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,770
right software that used in radio and

79
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,930
this may be very useful for someone else

80
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,910
but it's not realistic that they gonna

81
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,280
end up writing like package for Debian

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,640
for fedora for Red Hat for whatever

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,650
that's really not the case

84
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,400
and so the only thing that we can do is

85
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,530
make that easy and also have some

86
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,390
mechanism to install it and of course

87
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,250
like if you want to have narrated with

88
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,669
console for some reason you need first

89
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,320
in a recent version and you just won't

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,720
get that on most this Rose today

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,270
thank you not very probable that it

92
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,539
comes with that right working and all of

93
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,370
us are broken but that doesn't change to

94
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,289
pick this redhead can't go back in

95
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,690
history and just ship new version and so

96
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,960
here you are with that problem and also

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,430
like obviously the statistics in the

98
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,930
open-source developers meeting so

99
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,340
everyone wants to look at the code and

100
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,620
build it themselves even aside from

101
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,470
gradual people that's really nice for if

102
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,400
you're

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,560
into something enter pie bombs pythons

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,070
this hour

105
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,320
I always forget football acronyms of

106
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,520
pipe built over a management system

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,110
which which takes the job and knowing us

108
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,060
all dependency is knowing what a

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,070
dependency a package including greater

110
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,259
head it knows how to install using your

111
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,479
distro then that ways or it knows how to

112
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,100
build them from salt if there is no

113
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,470
standard ways or your attitude good from

114
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,289
source so this is really nice we can

115
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,570
think of it as something that actually

116
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,000
that just takes the burden of knowing

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,850
going to the website known to get ready

118
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,320
that you have to tell knowing how to

119
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,720
call configure have now how to calm a or

120
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,169
a street many or whatever and install it

121
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,440
into a prefix and this is really

122
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,740
interesting a prefix is a directory way

123
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,500
you put your stuff and you just like

124
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,080
point to the runtime library later and

125
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,300
you point your path in there and some

126
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,800
these stuff is there you can execute

127
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
whatever can recommending and it works

128
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,289
and if you don't set up their variables

129
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,020
the Linux system or OS X system just us

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,449
know it like there's other libraries in

131
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,750
there it just every ever interfere with

132
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,000
operation of you normal systems of so

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
this is something that has been very

134
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,990
very helpful for people that run

135
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,240
experimental software everywhere baby

136
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,389
since forever no one knows that if

137
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,760
you're a Python there you might have to

138
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,740
use virtual em so this is kind of the

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,169
same idea the advice will just set the

140
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,789
right variables and tighten up quite

141
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,340
enough for my height modules um so

142
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,780
getting pythons really simple I'm not

143
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,430
gonna go into detail about that for

144
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,570
several reasons using it is even simpler

145
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,250
you just like say okay this is this

146
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,320
proof that says on my set sets on a path

147
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,659
and you're done you do that and then you

148
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,120
can call you radio and it start with

149
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,039
Android applications and everything's

150
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,340
there

151
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,670
but I mentioned that it is an evil

152
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,710
system and Ben mentioned that in his

153
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,650
intro we have Seagram and there's like

154
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,810
every a lot of out of three months or a

155
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,370
lot of applications that people develop

156
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,340
are already available easily and you can

157
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,289
just insert them by them saying hi bumps

158
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,250
install whatever IP cap and then you

159
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,070
simply have an interface for capturing

160
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:52,900
packets with fire chart Lorena so this

161
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,000
is pretty awesome in it these are the

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
installation of stuff pretty much and

163
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,680
also it gives us like the ability to

164
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,780
distribute something easily have like a

165
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,820
central idea of what's there what would

166
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,490
what's missing and also like where to

167
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,470
report box and this kind of thing so

168
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,210
this is chapter break I should have

169
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,380
marked that more clearly

170
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,080
I mean we're coming to the part where we

171
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
actually build from

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,890
okay we have to rainy we have ways to

173
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,950
install it we have the idea that you

174
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,250
raided some kind of signal processing

175
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,900
and system but how do we get from these

176
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,530
abstract ideas to an actual so what I

177
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,120
did is I looked at a simple like

178
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,130
physical radio receiver and that's what

179
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,310
we often think about it is chain it's

180
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,020
chainable there's an antenna - an

181
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,700
amplifier spiritual sense makes us

182
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,650
there's an analog to digital converter

183
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,980
as a digital PLL so in my power is never

184
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,410
something locks onto the channel I want

185
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,070
to receive then there's M demodulator

186
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,890
and equalizer so doesn't sound sound as

187
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:15,910
shitty and then there's like so this is

188
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,070
my whole system and as this is how I

189
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,080
want to understand it and how I want to

190
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,210
represent in the end in my son whereas

191
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm gonna write because you know so if

192
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,380
you

193
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,440
like that into no radial and then it

194
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,270
looks kind of like this I'm going to

195
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,880
jump back to the last like couple of

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,160
times that we have to use a resource or

197
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
they are the lsdm source or usually you

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,360
just use the osmocon source which is

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,690
like yes this guy wrote that so which

200
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,730
covers a lot of heart rate receivers and

201
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,890
then has to drop off like that

202
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,690
encapsulated she a hardware interface

203
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,750
which usually ends here so this is all

204
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,940
encapsulated by hardware source and so

205
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,500
the next thing they do is like the

206
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,780
carrier tracking then we have the FM

207
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,120
mr.justice Max one two one two who like

208
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,800
the logical blocks that you have in mind

209
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
when you're designing that system and

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
then you have I felt like an equalizer

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
that I could explain it for I've said

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,690
like we have three years regardless

213
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,820
filters and they won't cover so not not

214
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,370
a part of the audio band then everyone

215
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,830
has a different gain and we end up words

216
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,340
and we add them back up so we can like

217
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,990
change the amplitude of like the fast

218
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,990
medium tones high hills and then we just

219
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,460
feed it into how hard a thing which is

220
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,950
like another thing that the sound card

221
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,860
and everything behind that does so so

222
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,190
this is like theory or solidified off of

223
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,400
your system converts it to practice and

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:57,900
less than two winners so I know that

225
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,790
because then actually like show the same

226
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,500
demo with GQ Eric's which of course

227
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,740
looks nicer and I just like at the same

228
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:13,050
flow graph for inside radio so that

229
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,770
works so that's this is my whole program

230
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,690
that works and it looks like that after

231
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,260
you click together this so you can build

232
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,270
a car an application actually like

233
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,300
receives behold I am band by clicking

234
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,070
together this already

235
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,970
opinion which kind of awesome because if

236
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,250
you understand what you want to do then

237
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,700
getting from well here to there is

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,090
really like five minutes of birth this

239
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,770
is the power of software-defined radio

240
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,180
and especially the array is in fact the

241
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,250
right tool you can just bill put you on

242
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,900
back in a minute

243
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,560
so um but I have a minute left so I'd

244
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,840
like compartment no that's not always a

245
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,150
case we don't always have the tools for

246
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,730
example if you want to build something

247
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,030
really absurd well no one's gonna be

248
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,220
there to build that before you come

249
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,760
there so you can rent them out of three

250
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,010
module which is like our kind of saying

251
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,960
okay this is a new radio peg that you

252
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,880
can have your blocks in there you can

253
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,780
have your fluorescent one directly and

254
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:30,810
share that with other people and that's

255
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,300
really easy there we have tools already

256
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,940
much rule which is meant to like build

257
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,840
modules you just add a new tool and my

258
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,130
example that lets you creation that

259
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,810
build I thought okay what's what's

260
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,430
absurd and I said okay let's let's do a

261
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,050
speaking talk there's a space at the

262
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:54,090
next piece is whatever too late how do

263
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,520
you do that okay I'm lazy I'm just gonna

264
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,190
use something it's this thing and write

265
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,080
a Python block because you can write the

266
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,360
right block the cheap apartment because

267
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,370
I'm lazy obviously I'm gonna go for pipe

268
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,220
and why do I do that

269
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,740
okay we're gonna skip that point how

270
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,330
should it look like it's really like I

271
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,610
have a clock and it just says at the

272
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,460
next beat it's sensor and I'm actually

273
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,920
what I did then is like okay I make any

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,329
model so you must be blocked so hey

275
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,009
[Music]

276
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,990
[Music]

277
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,280
everything writes this plot now how does

278
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,030
that look like

279
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,180
the utmost ugly killed that I can come

280
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,160
up yesterday so thank you like it's the

281
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,140
same procedure says okay mi Emporium it

282
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,580
examples am I waiting for the next

283
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,330
school time or am I currently speaking

284
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,210
and then it's just like my singing song

285
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:21,560
or generates the voice for the next

286
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,850
second while I'm waiting for it and thus

287
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,520
that by calling each be on the comment

288
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,990
line so this is the most you could way

289
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,090
to do this now they actually work and

290
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,520
was like 20 lines of pipe and then I put

291
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,050
it in two different things because I

292
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,630
wanted to have time to man but I in the

293
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:46,520
end this is all that matters actually is

294
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,820
in this work method which we did that

295
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,800
takes it into the temple in any case it

296
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,660
was a source because then generates

297
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,600
output items and I write items whatever

298
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,490
I want again generate and that's how you

299
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,800
write on the radio blocks basically so

300
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,119
this was a really really really short

301
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,500
intro to write on writing greater blocks

302
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,089
and actually rounded I have a little bit

303
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,390
of unite so I'm gonna predict our own

304
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,670
here okay yeah one minute it's not

305
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,240
leaving the room
