1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,220
my name is Nils the force I work on

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,110
Gloucester I'm one of the commentators

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,549
and I will just tell you a bit about the

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:16,039
current state and the features that that

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,260
we have so a very short introduction

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,110
Gloucester is POSIX like file system it

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,370
provides access through different

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,250
protocols including no allows us to make

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,140
this like few mounts and the first

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,420
month's object storage and also block

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,489
storage through for example came with

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,460
native drivers there is no major data

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,100
service so this is the first the talk

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,190
before has a metadata server list that

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,660
doesn't have a method a surfer staff

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,360
doesn't have made a data service for

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,320
their object store we prefer to

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,750
calculate the position of where the data

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,229
is instead of asking someone about where

20
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,499
they object to find so our clients are a

21
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,319
bit more smart and we actually know

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,420
where the data is instead of keeping

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,009
track of everything cluster runs on

24
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,409
basically any kind of hardware at home I

25
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,999
don't make Gloucester environment for

26
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,920
testing and installation media and

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,529
everything on small 32-bit arm systems

28
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:32,779
that works perfectly fine thread heads

29
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,749
we have many customers that run on

30
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:38,959
pretty decent they'll HP and any vendor

31
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,560
you can imagine kind of hardware so from

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,329
the small things to the big things we do

33
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,639
everything basically size are important

34
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,909
so you can scale up if needed add more

35
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,469
service if you need more storage

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
integrations with so you use it through

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,609
fuse NFS samba

38
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,229
or any of the other tools and there are

39
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,508
integrations with different projects so

40
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,568
if you want to store backups on

41
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,860
Gloucester you can use for example

42
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,260
Barrios make all your work stations and

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,730
Barrios knows how to speak the

44
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,140
Gloucester protocols and outlet to be

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,620
store your data there and of course it's

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,030
a bag of solutions you can also recover

47
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,190
its various even has the option to

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,530
backup Gloucester volumes so Barrios is

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,019
a whole fuel featured backup solution

50
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,569
and if you want to backup your blasters

51
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,900
volume onto tape or Amazon glacier or

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,370
anything slow cold storage values and

53
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,049
other makeup tools would be able to do

54
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:46,959
that so we have partnerships or well

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
work together relationships with

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,519
commercial products that use cluster and

57
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,269
provide our first Leggett Beckham

58
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,650
replication is one of the main features

59
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,780
so this is a distributed replicated

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,329
blustered volume you see on the top

61
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,459
there's a distribution algorithm then

62
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,100
the replication event very similar to

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,470
how this mathematical description works

64
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,829
we do first the distribution on one

65
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,870
layer and then the second layer does the

66
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,239
replication in our case it's completely

67
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,329
disconnected so we done indeed into

68
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,799
these kind of problems there's no

69
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,700
connection between those algorithms and

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,519
that's not always the most efficient use

71
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,280
for disks and urine to unexpected issues

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,680
instead of using replication and

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,340
distribution there is also array she

74
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,849
coded options so you can use we call up

75
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,620
dispersed it's logical so it's like a

76
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,530
rate five over the network it's a bit

77
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,599
more complex because blistered by

78
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,959
default uses everything based on files

79
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,510
so you have distribution based on the

80
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,220
whole file the file will locate it on

81
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,229
one of the breaks if you do the

82
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,419
application this particular file gets

83
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,400
replicated exactly to all the pics you

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,480
need

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,139
so it's really file based and in

86
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,339
absolute emergencies system

87
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,949
administrators can go to the storage go

88
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,600
to the XFS file system or whatever

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,060
fastest news and you see the files you

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,039
can access the files without using Blas

91
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,590
we don't recommend it but if you're in

92
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,940
an emergency situation you can actually

93
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,400
do this so administrators feel very

94
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,889
happy about it but this tip you off with

95
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,090
dispersed volumes files get splitting

96
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,370
chunks and get encoded so that you have

97
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,240
the erasure codes bits if you go to the

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,270
backend as an administrator and you want

99
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,440
to read the file you only see the

100
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,270
encoded bits and you have only a couple

101
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,800
of encoded bits on this particular

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,570
server you have not a couple of encoded

103
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,460
bits on other servers so you somehow

104
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,110
have to reconstruct this this is

105
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,750
something that is relatively new we

106
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,940
don't see a very high rate of adoption

107
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,759
because administrators don't feel too

108
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,660
confident about this because they just

109
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,699
can't see the contents immediately what

110
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,090
they used to see with previous or other

111
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,009
type of volumes so this is something

112
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,330
that's been working on and has arrived

113
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,349
like two years ago maybe for the first

114
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,180
time so in the meantime it's it's very

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,389
stable it's used everywhere but many

116
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,780
users still are not very eager to adopt

117
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,820
it it also comes with performance

118
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,330
penalties all the glister packages are

119
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,349
part of many different distributions so

120
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,520
we try to push the packages in for

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,020
example in debian there's a version of

122
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,610
Gloucester in Fedora there's a version

123
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,490
of Gloucester we provide them for recent

124
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,469
West storage sakes there is a net bsd

125
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:02,930
contributor that pushes the Gloucester

126
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,590
packages into net bsd there has been

127
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,139
work with freebsd people to put it in

128
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,150
the port i'm not sure what the current

129
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,159
status is because one of the main

130
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,539
tenants was doing a lot of work there

131
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,969
and find something else to do so

132
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,330
probably need to pick that up again yeah

133
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,130
we try to make it really easy for users

134
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,110
to install cluster and make sure that

135
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,800
every district

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,250
illusion has its native insulation

137
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,620
swords there are several quick start

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,750
guys and the documentation through

139
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,569
bluster to talk but for example some of

140
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,849
the dispute over their own Vicky's and

141
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,199
you can go to the wiki pages there

142
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,879
recently we changed our release schedule

143
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,210
a little bit so we were doing releases

144
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,849
roughly every six months and every

145
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:52,310
release was maintained like up to two

146
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,970
releases until the third release

147
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,460
follow-up release would be done so for

148
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,229
example 3:05 release was supported until

149
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,419
well the old schedule so it was planned

150
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,460
to be supported until the three of ten

151
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,810
release was done unfortunately six

152
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,879
months release cycles were not very

153
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,879
ideal because every release would have

154
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,370
like thirty new features it would be a

155
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,150
huge amount of features and users cannot

156
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,259
easily go through these features and say

157
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,419
okay what's new and I want to try this

158
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,460
out I want to try this out we would

159
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,330
overwhelm users developers that work on

160
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,060
several months on feature they would

161
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,610
like to see this feature make sometimes

162
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,169
small features is like one month or two

163
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,789
months development cycle and they would

164
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,319
like to see the adoption of the future

165
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,319
or have feedback from users and waiting

166
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,969
six months for the next release would be

167
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,159
really long so we changed the release

168
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,360
schedule with the current releases and

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,150
now we do a three month release cycle so

170
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,289
that makes it possible for developers

171
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,509
and users to try out new features and

172
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:04,360
get feedback and everything but we can't

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,940
require users of a storage solution to

174
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,110
switch every like six months or maybe

175
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,460
nine months of their storage solution

176
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,650
users prefer to have a stable solution

177
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,590
and don't want to upgrade two of them so

178
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,449
what we do is we have a long-term

179
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,819
maintenance release three that eight is

180
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,409
the first official long-term maintenance

181
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,560
release that we have and three months

182
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,289
later see that nine gets out 3.9 is a

183
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,510
short-term maintenance release it is

184
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,299
supported for three months until the

185
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:35,570
neck

186
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,630
release gets out so with the release of

187
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,390
310 3.9 gets deprecated abandoned 3 8 is

188
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,740
a long-term maintenance release so it

189
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,680
will still be supported and gets booked

190
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,530
fixed updates and everything and this is

191
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,260
the the current approach that we're

192
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,140
taking 3 to 10 boss has a release

193
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,260
candidate I think was tagged last week

194
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,050
and it's planned to be he released it

195
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,900
become coming weeks so we're doing some

196
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,640
tests that make sure that everything is

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,840
there and look at its release surely

198
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:21,890
before much with the 3 9 release which

199
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,690
is a pretty current short-term

200
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,030
maintenance release that's still being

201
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,070
worked on and eBooks gets fixed in this

202
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,270
shortened maintenance release we had

203
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,460
additional comments to east replacement

204
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,520
of breaks multi-threaded self-heal

205
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,310
existed for no more application but it

206
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,520
didn't for evasion coded application so

207
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,490
now we have noticed at itself hill for

208
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,260
erasure or dispersed problems also for

209
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,940
energy code forms we added CPU

210
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,600
optimizations so we have some of the

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,400
assembler code for the erasure coded

212
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,080
racial coding functions that we have so

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
that it's more optimized in the CPU not

214
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,830
that the CPU is normally a bottleneck

215
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,590
but with regi coded volumes

216
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,880
you definitely have more CPU usage and

217
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,670
if you have low end Hardware then these

218
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,810
optimizations make make a difference

219
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,490
sometimes clients take a look at the

220
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,500
file and this file as in or the client

221
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,890
has an issue they look needs to be

222
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,610
revoked and you have to CLI gotten from

223
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,860
see I see the comment line interface

224
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,990
Facebook uses clustered a lot and they

225
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,680
don't really care about the crashes that

226
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,459
they have on client

227
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,050
site systems so the Facebook team that

228
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,199
provides the storage interfaces we said

229
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,179
well applications is not our business

230
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,309
but they tend to crash they forgot to

231
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,699
release logs and we cannot wait for the

232
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,499
timeouts that it takes to detect this

233
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:06,679
kind of lock loss or application loss so

234
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,689
we want applications to take over

235
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,990
immediately so we added a functionality

236
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,529
to actively revoke locks on demand when

237
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,230
the application management interfaces

238
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,970
notice that an application crashed or

239
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,379
it's not responsive anymore they kill

240
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,240
the application and they revoke the

241
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,540
locks as well so it makes it a bit more

242
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,029
flexible and everything and we have

243
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,999
better detection so if data changes on

244
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:35,860
the back end or discs start to return

245
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,619
non fatal reach errors and we can detect

246
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:43,459
them and it's a background process that

247
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,790
runs every so many times now there's an

248
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,559
only month way of triggering this

249
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,019
scrubbing and checking we added more

250
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,529
api's so that you can do eventing so

251
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,119
anything management infrastructure

252
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,619
around Gloucester needs to get

253
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,860
notifications and notifications are

254
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,980
important to know when bricks or servers

255
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,339
are missing or crashed or discs are

256
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,279
failing and display these events in a

257
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,779
web interface is important

258
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,179
it really helps administrators to figure

259
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,189
out what's wrong they don't seem to like

260
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,809
to go through logs anymore everyone

261
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,699
wants a web interface so we needed a

262
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,779
notification API to provide this we also

263
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,360
improved our dual application so we have

264
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,049
multi-site replication and it's always a

265
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,449
bit tricky to set up so we have

266
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,829
interface to make it a bit easier to

267
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:43,089
configure that's also come online 3.8

268
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,179
time before already added some REST API

269
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:53,269
so you can configure cluster through

270
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,119
REST API so mostly hey Katie

271
00:12:56,119 --> 00:13:00,339
does this in combination kubernetes

272
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,749
we edit improvements for sparse files

273
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,230
sparse files over a network are useful

274
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,600
that you do not read the empty areas so

275
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
if you have a gigabyte file which only

276
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,369
contains a little bit of data and then

277
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:17,100
maybe at the end of data and the middle

278
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,579
is empty it's part over a network file

279
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,220
system you prefer not to read this empty

280
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,259
area you prefer to skip it because

281
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,649
reading for example zeros is not very

282
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,509
efficient and it would cost just a lot

283
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,339
of network bandwidth so backup

284
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,230
applications were not very happy with

285
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,119
that it wasn't existing and we added

286
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:40,049
that in the previous release again to

287
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:42,169
replication because it's one of the big

288
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,649
functionalities that the offering

289
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,519
blaster we made it tearing aware so we

290
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,980
have a tearing you have a faster and

291
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,629
slow tear and now to your application

292
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,509
can actually do that decently sharding

293
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,959
is splitting from big files into chunks

294
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,569
general replication didn't do that

295
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,449
efficiently either that has been

296
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,819
addressed some users use only two copies

297
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,859
of the data instead of three what we

298
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,829
recommend if you have two copies of your

299
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,739
data you can run into split-brain

300
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:19,139
scenarios which is a problem for that

301
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,209
you have to resolve them and you resolve

302
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,959
them in class a bit a policy based split

303
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,959
brain resolution so that means that you

304
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,759
can say the biggest file is always the

305
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,129
correct file or the file that is updated

306
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,649
last or several of these parties

307
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,789
policies now exist and it helps

308
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,980
administrators immensely they don't have

309
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,089
to recover or fix the split brains for

310
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,829
every single file that just can set the

311
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,689
policy on this particular type of volume

312
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,819
for this particular kind of workload and

313
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,369
they pick whatever solution they they

314
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,459
would like to see best there's an

315
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,459
previously we had noticed its self you

316
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,100
I'm sharing this loop with Patrick so I

317
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,470
don't know how much time we have left

318
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,019
yeah okay yeah okay so 307 is the

319
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,079
current oldest release that we still

320
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,679
support if you have not upgraded to 3.7

321
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,899
yet many of the users stay on the

322
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,389
release that they sometimes install so

323
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,519
we see a lot of users that's still using

324
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,670
3.6 3.6 s up with any bug fixed updates

325
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,170
anymore 3.7 is the oldest release and it

326
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,209
gets out of support or out of

327
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,369
maintenance within the next couple of

328
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,910
weeks when three or ten is released and

329
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:49,139
still these features are not known to

330
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,410
many of the users so we have small file

331
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,519
performance enhancements so like mail

332
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,100
directories are still not very efficient

333
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,420
because it's really a lot of small files

334
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,279
and file systems just don't like small

335
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,529
files especially Network file systems

336
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,049
don't like small files but we improve

337
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,600
this and there's work out there has been

338
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,610
work going on a lot to enhance it

339
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:17,009
already tearing so hot ho tears and coal

340
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,730
tears that have data that is used a lot

341
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,879
are on fast storage and data that is not

342
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:31,679
used much is on the cold storage windows

343
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,319
users like to be able to undelete house

344
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,679
in the linux and unix world we just

345
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,290
delete the file and we know it's gone

346
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,290
when those users don't seem to like that

347
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,919
they want to have a trash directory and

348
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,299
they want to have this kind of support

349
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,220
on blustered as well so we have a lot of

350
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,439
users that use clustering combination

351
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:56,040
with samba and they requested us to

352
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,499
provide like a trash or recycle bin

353
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,049
directory where the files are still

354
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,929
there in case they deleted something and

355
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,089
they can just copy the files back if

356
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,750
they want

357
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,079
so improvements in NFS so more advanced

358
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,439
configuration also contributed by by

359
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,349
Facebook so Facebook tends to send huge

360
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,429
large features that they use internally

361
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,059
and that's that's actually quite nice so

362
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:27,569
most of times you get really small

363
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,429
changes or improvements from from users

364
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:32,470
sometimes bug fixes but Facebook

365
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,200
actually sends like like 10,000 lines of

366
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,169
code changes in patches it's not always

367
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,530
easy to go through those but it's it's

368
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,640
actually quite nice to see those

369
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,710
features yeah one of the hot items is

370
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,230
NFS Ganesha that's coming just yell if

371
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,990
you want to replace the Gloucester stuff

372
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:02,980
itself so alphas Canisius one of the

373
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,650
things that's coming and more adopting

374
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,780
much more so with 310 and if it's

375
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,880
Ganesha is not enabled by or NFS Ganesha

376
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,280
as I suggested NFS solution Gloucester

377
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,340
NFS the old NFS server is basically

378
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,820
deprecated and will fix bugs in it but

379
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,950
you won't spend much time on enhancing

380
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,549
its further break multiplexing at the

381
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:28,299
moment for every storage units so for

382
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,130
the people who were and in all its talk

383
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,770
the OSD is like a storage unit for force

384
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,770
F breaks are a storage unit for

385
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,970
Gloucester and we use a process per

386
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,240
brick which is fine as long as you do

387
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,650
not have too many breaks or too many

388
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,350
many volumes because volume needs number

389
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,700
of picks where they contain kind of

390
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,950
solutions that are happening and people

391
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,409
want to you have small volumes but just

392
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:58,960
really a lot of volumes so instead of

393
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,480
the huge data storage and file systems

394
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,690
that we normally do containers run small

395
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,330
volumes so like 50 gigabytes of volumes

396
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,130
or hundred gigabytes of volumes and we

397
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,380
normally would go into the terabytes for

398
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,770
storage so instead of this couple of big

399
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,250
file systems we now have to provide many

400
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,740
small file systems and for all these

401
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,140
files

402
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,790
if you start processes and more

403
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,400
processes for the bricks that's a bit of

404
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,250
cumbersome to manage so we have brick

405
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,410
multiplexing that is actually one binary

406
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,860
or one process obviously multi-threaded

407
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,510
that uses multiple breaks and that

408
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,610
enhances the performance for these kind

409
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,590
of workloads quite a lot so that's

410
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,500
coming up next more metadata cache

411
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,600
enhancements so it has mostly

412
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,620
enhancements for small files so if you

413
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,970
store home directories or git

414
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,030
repositories on Gluster 3.10 will

415
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,080
improve performance quite a bit there

416
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,830
NFS conditions some Bob will use store

417
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,700
Hawk store Hawk is a project that is and

418
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,900
it's a solution for most storage

419
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,910
environments and at the moment we

420
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,710
suggest to use CTD be for Samba

421
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,790
environments NFS Kaneesha with pacemaker

422
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,360
and store Hawk actually combines the

423
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,020
same approach for both NFS Kaneesha and

424
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,260
for samba it uses pacemaker and that's

425
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,290
what we will use for or suggest our

426
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,530
users to use we'll test it much more

427
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,290
than we test DB and and pacemaker

428
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,820
separately so we have one project that

429
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,560
we use for everything it makes it much

430
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,870
easier for users to set it up and

431
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,090
they're familiar with with the set of

432
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,190
them we spelled out the TLD mean from

433
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,590
the solar tearing process is now managed

434
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,710
by glass study and you can easy check

435
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,050
its status and see if there are any

436
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,880
problems or how busy the process is and

437
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,310
everything so it's it's a bit more easy

438
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,670
to manage and they'll be able to debug

439
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,860
things more for applications that have

440
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,060
motivations so kami for example more

441
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,130
improvements for telling a common we

442
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,660
still do not support chip directly

443
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,000
mounts over fuse if you meet subtracted

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,680
amounts over NFS or somebody you can do

445
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,900
it but fuse doesn't allow us to do that

446
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,300
yet because how we have our our

447
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,690
internals structures for four volumes so

448
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,920
that's something that we really want to

449
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,860
address for 3.11 we tried to get into

450
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,550
three

451
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,160
but some of the developers got busy with

452
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,870
other tasks and now they want to put it

453
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,660
in 3:11 and that's happening in like

454
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,200
three months

455
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,150
so hopefully they have the time to look

456
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,580
into this I see Linux on less the

457
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,620
volumes is something different they'll

458
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,020
speak about this afternoon service I PhD

459
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,880
to improve read there so by standard we

460
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,800
have all our logic done on the client

461
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,080
sites so the client knows about the

462
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,179
solution the client knows exactly where

463
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,870
all the files are that's so fine if you

464
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,490
just know the filename and you need to

465
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,400
open the file but we have many Windows

466
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,140
users that like to do LS or there or

467
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,880
open their Explorer window and see all

468
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,450
the files read there it's very

469
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,890
inefficient because you have to connect

470
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,440
to all of the distributed part then you

471
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,290
have combined all the results and

472
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,770
display it decently because really this

473
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,350
kind of funky you get the whole stream

474
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,480
of directories but you can also rewind

475
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,950
things so you can basically say seek in

476
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,570
a POSIX way through a directory list and

477
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,400
that means that if you seek back and

478
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,410
forth the order of directory or the

479
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,800
order of entries still needs to be

480
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,160
roughly the same which is very difficult

481
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,040
in the distributed environments so we're

482
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,920
moving part of our distribution logic to

483
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,970
the server side web server actually does

484
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,880
some kind of magic details and the

485
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,980
client can actually do the read there

486
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,990
and rewinding and everything a bit more

487
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,780
efficient so that's also coming in the

488
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,179
next like three months hopefully this

489
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,190
summer we'll get Gloucester for that oh

490
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,410
the first talk this morning was from

491
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,280
kosheh about velocity to the Tau cluster

492
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
B is the management demon it's being

493
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,620
rewritten in golang and it's one of the

494
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,040
key components for blister photos oh

495
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,309
because this this V write is mainly done

496
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,800
to improve the scalability so make sure

497
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,020
that we can address like thousands

498
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,670
bless the service more efficiently than

499
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,440
that we can do now if you're now going

500
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
over like hundred plus the service all

501
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,460
the service stuff to each other so it's

502
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,470
very inefficient and you will most

503
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,330
likely run into bottlenecks if you don't

504
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,250
have too much Network bent it and

505
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,440
network desk and everything so velocity

506
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,390
to the DOE will be a big improvement for

507
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,940
the management infrastructure will do

508
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,870
things like I know the Phi so you can

509
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,850
actually listen for owner directory and

510
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,640
see if their new files get added or not

511
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,560
and things like that and that's

512
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,480
something that people really would like

513
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,280
to see the Gloucester protocols use soon

514
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,350
a PC with xgr and code it's very similar

515
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,710
to NFS but they are not really secured

516
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,940
that way we do have SSL support but as

517
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,950
the support is from one client to a

518
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,810
server and not on user base so if you

519
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,820
have multiple tenants on a server they

520
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,880
would all use the same ssl connections

521
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
which is not really appreciated by many

522
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,870
so we want to provide the same security

523
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,840
that NFS offers because NFS is well

524
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,630
known by many organizations they seem to

525
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,170
use Kerberos mostly and we would like to

526
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,230
use the same infrastructure that they

527
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,080
use and provide a bit of support for

528
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,160
Gloucester warm retention and compliance

529
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,320
is something that people want as well so

530
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,600
similar to life cycle kind of ways

531
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,930
unable to delete a file until the next

532
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,000
two years or something like that move a

533
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,420
file to a particular directory when

534
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,860
certain events happen or so those things

535
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,960
are coming but it's it's slowly because

536
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,590
it's not really on our priority list

537
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,120
hopefully we have a bit more

538
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,730
functionality in the photo overlays we

539
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,370
have basic more features but they're

540
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,250
nowhere to what people expect from

541
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,730
compliance approved warm so we have

542
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,610
simple right ones with many kind of

543
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,800
features but it's just like toy and

544
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,500
nothing really really official the

545
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,260
basically ends my slides so you have

546
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,890
some minutes left if you have any

547
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,500
questions about lustre I'll be around in

548
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,540
this room or at the Gloucester booth in

549
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,670
the K building don't hesitate to email

550
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,170
the users list or anything that in the

551
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,700
IRC channel so we have the hash blaster

552
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,070
on freenode we have quite some users all

553
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,870
over the world that post questions

554
00:26:35,870 --> 00:27:02,150
answer questions all right as he

555
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,530
mentioned I'm just going to take a few

556
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,610
minutes to talk a little bit about

557
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,080
what's going on in the Ceph community

558
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,550
lately as some of you came in late I

559
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,620
know that this talk was originally

560
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,820
supposed to be about the Ceph user

561
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,280
committee and Vito was gonna cover some

562
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,440
of what was going on in there so I will

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,880
hopefully touch on a few of those things

564
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,340
but those of you that don't know me my

565
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,230
name is Patrick McGarry I'm the director

566
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,220
community for the force F at Red Hat

567
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,230
just wanted to touch a few things

568
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,610
there's always a lot going on in the

569
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,410
Ceph community so I just kind of wanted

570
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,060
to touch on a few of the highlights in

571
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,560
the few minutes that we have left here

572
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,990
before we get on to a real presentation

573
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,350
so one of the great things that we like

574
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,420
to do throughout the year is our set day

575
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,140
program it's basically we go around the

576
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,510
globe find somebody who wants to host

577
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,640
and have a whole day event about Seth so

578
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,630
individual members from the community

579
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,490
will come in they'll talk about what

580
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,470
they're doing and the reason I bring

581
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,500
this up is we will have we have plenty

582
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,710
of set days that are coming up this year

583
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,660
the ones that are already published we

584
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,400
have San Jose and 17th

585
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,810
arch we're gonna be in Boston during

586
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,580
OpenStack and we'll be in the

587
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,520
Netherlands on September 20th some of

588
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,690
the other ones that are in progress

589
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,820
right now I believe we are headed back

590
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,620
to Frankfurt

591
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,620
we may be in Stockholm and Warsaw in

592
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,220
April and will also be probably in

593
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,160
Taiwan will be in Sydney during early

594
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,740
November and several others but if you

595
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,350
look at the the new SEF website at slash

596
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,690
SEF days you should see them as they

597
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,860
become available one thing I wanted to

598
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,500
talk about also was that the we're

599
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,830
moving to the new metrics platform so

600
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,290
right now we have metrics F comm it's a

601
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,660
great dashboard shows all of the kind of

602
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,190
ins and outs of what's going on in the

603
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,440
Ceph community it was built by the

604
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,590
bitter geo guys with us so those of you

605
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,410
that were at grimoire con this this past

606
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,140
Friday you'll already know a lot of this

607
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,160
but we're pretty excited about where

608
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,040
we're headed next we're moving to a

609
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,050
cabana based dashboard so you'll

610
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,400
actually be able to play with it and dig

611
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,470
into the numbers but more importantly

612
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,210
we're also launching a new tool called

613
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:22,510
SEF Bragg this is a part Bragg and part

614
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,260
tool so users have the ability to do

615
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,700
some performance tests on their SEF

616
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,160
clusters and share that performance data

617
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,510
with the Ceph community at large and

618
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,950
this is great they can share you know

619
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,440
I've got 1.4 million I ops on my cluster

620
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,520
look how awesome I am

621
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,120
but in the other side it allows users

622
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,950
that are either new to staff or looking

623
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,060
to improve their footprint in SEF to

624
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,980
take a look at this set brag tool and

625
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,920
sort by use cases that are similar to

626
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,140
what is that they're doing so take a

627
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,970
look at people that have you know large

628
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,390
numbers of files that are small files

629
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,800
and check out other people that are

630
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,900
doing similar things see the hardware

631
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,320
footprint see their tuning options and

632
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,720
get a much better idea of kind of where

633
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,880
they should start so we're hoping it'll

634
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,300
be a little bit of both as I mentioned

635
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,770
Beto was originally supposed to be here

636
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,600
to talk about the user committee the

637
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,020
user committee was the

638
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,240
first little baby steps into governance

639
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,670
that we took about three and a half

640
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,120
years ago and it has since grown into a

641
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,720
very nice part of the community

642
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,870
underneath the now safe advisory board

643
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,930
which is our actual governance most

644
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,760
recently they've been involved in

645
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,580
helping with our release cadence doing

646
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,250
contributor credits and most notably our

647
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,770
mirror Network so Steph is actually

648
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,140
building a functional global mirror

649
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,270
network so we're very excited about that

650
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,030
we have mirrors in China Australia a

651
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,600
couple in the EU a couple in the US and

652
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,790
more are coming every day I believe

653
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,400
there's one plant and in Japan and

654
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,560
several throughout Southeast Asia so

655
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,520
very exciting to see that and anyone can

656
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,590
become a mirror assuming you meet a

657
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,260
couple of simple guidelines so if you're

658
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,520
interested in that definitely go check

659
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,670
it out it's on the Ceph website it's

660
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,730
also in the Ceph doc and you can you can

661
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,230
check that if you can't find it let me

662
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,820
know I'd be more than happy to point you

663
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,130
in the right direction as I mentioned we

664
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,250
have real self-governance now this

665
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,080
launched in October of last year we

666
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,920
tried to get a pretty good

667
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,750
representation across the entirety of

668
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,660
the the Ceph ecosystem a little bit of

669
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,780
the academic roots a little bit of the

670
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,850
individual contributor roots and then

671
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,830
some of the larger players that were

672
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,960
making kind of long-term strategic bets

673
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,090
on Seth so we want to make sure everyone

674
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,700
had a voice in helping to drive set

675
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,910
forward the nice thing is Seth as you

676
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,220
know as it was designed no one can

677
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,430
really own Seth Red Hat may own the

678
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,500
trademarks but no one can actually own

679
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,080
the code it was deliberately built with

680
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,050
a fractured copyright or a distributed

681
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,760
copyright so anyone that contributes to

682
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,620
Seth owns their contributions in

683
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,770
perpetuity so that's nice no big bad can

684
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,840
come along by Saif and and make it evil

685
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,560
so it's it's nice to see that a lot of

686
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
these companies that are doing large

687
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,620
contributions are also getting involved

688
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,350
in kind of helping to drive the

689
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,529
community forward as well as the code

690
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,840
SEF techtalks so if you would like to

691
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,450
know more about deeper levels of

692
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,880
technical things associated with the

693
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Ceph community and tangentially related

694
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,970
projects every every month we do a set

695
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,279
tech talk it is the fourth Thursday of

696
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,130
the month it's done online so anyone can

697
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,070
join this one we hold at the same time

698
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,720
every month so I don't flop it around

699
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,470
like the developer monthly but 1:00 p.m.

700
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,779
Easter I think so it's only like 7

701
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,320
o'clock here so it's not too bad we

702
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,360
usually have a pretty good variance of

703
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,880
speakers everything from core team

704
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,399
members I know Josh has previously

705
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,820
talked about our BD Sam talked about ray

706
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,399
dos all the way over to the other side

707
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,470
where people are talking about

708
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,850
integrations work and management tools

709
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,980
and things like that so it's usually a

710
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,500
pretty good hours worth of deep

711
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
technical set discussion and a great

712
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,659
time to ask questions and any fund if

713
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,100
anyone wants to talk about their Ceph

714
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,470
work you're more than welcome and as I

715
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,570
mentioned we have the cephalopod lis

716
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,669
it's the first one day Wednesday of the

717
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:43,980
month and we alternate this one so

718
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,649
usually we have kind of a u.s. East and

719
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,380
Europe friendly time zone one and a u.s.

720
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,110
west and AIPAC friendly time zone

721
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,330
depending on the month and we alternate

722
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,120
back and forth again this is online and

723
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,100
it's usually designed for people that

724
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,570
are doing work on Seth to get together

725
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,610
and say here's what's coming here's what

726
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,559
I'm working on and make sure everyone's

727
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,250
kind of aware of what's going on

728
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,480
the biggest thing in the community

729
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,089
lately is new set calm we launched a new

730
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:14,520
website I'm pretty happy with how it

731
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,949
turned out there's definitely some some

732
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,540
great resources there and everything is

733
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,550
a lot more discoverable so if you

734
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,810
haven't stopped by stuff that common

735
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,179
lately definitely give it a shot we can

736
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,750
skip that and the the big news for this

737
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,030
year is we are holding our inaugural SEF

738
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,879
conference in August 23rd through the

739
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,389
25th in Boston so it will be the first

740
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,909
all Seth Conference that we've ever held

741
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,168
we're pretty excited about that

742
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:42,929
definitely take a look and come by if

743
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,119
you can join us so that's the end of the

744
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,070
Ceph community updates I'll be around if

745
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,699
anyone has the

746
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,859
questions otherwise I believe it is

747
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,040
about time to start a real presentation

748
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,790
so

749
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,690
[Applause]
