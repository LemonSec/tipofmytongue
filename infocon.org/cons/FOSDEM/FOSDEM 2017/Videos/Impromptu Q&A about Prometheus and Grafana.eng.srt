1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
good

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,740
so if you have any questions about

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,580
prometheus and/or graph honor this is

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,040
now a Q&A session because reasons does

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,520
anyone have questions

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:31,689
sure testing testing so many questions

7
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,830
for permit about me as a user of influx

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,699
TV short explanation difference between

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,970
influx and so the question is the

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,430
difference between influx TV and media

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,140
so I guess the main difference is that

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,760
Prometheus is a full monitoring system

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,859
which comes basically was end-to-end so

14
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,600
we have instrumentation libraries that

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,469
you can use for instrumentation

16
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,969
instrumenting your codes then we have

17
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,670
export us for a bunch of different tools

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,009
that out there like my sequel so that's

19
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,210
the instrumentation side let's come

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,380
about from easiest and then we're

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,570
parisa's itself which is the monitoring

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,070
system which includes a time series

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,229
database as well as actually the

24
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,000
collection so it can talk to service

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,950
discovery systems to detect what is out

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,530
there to be monitored and then fetch the

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,950
instrumented and metrics right and then

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,810
you flip every language on top and you

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,460
of the alerting on top and your field of

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,920
management i'm so basically whole chain

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,229
from imitation happen for graphing and

32
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,549
everything is covered by Prometheus

33
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,579
where syntax to be is first and foremost

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,350
time since database of course there are

35
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,750
also tools but they are sort of more in

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,049
spend alone manner I would say so I

37
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,850
would say it's like you know if we're

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,200
going to try and compare apples to

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,110
apples we need to compare Telegraph in

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,570
flux capacitor to previous exporters and

41
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,680
not the client libraries because in flux

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,990
doesn't have those and then you've got

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,799
Prometheus and then you've got the alert

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,149
manager because that's the fair

45
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:05,710
comparison because those are roughly the

46
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,199
same things and and there's

47
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,549
architectural differences there so on

48
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:12,519
the way I see in flux is prometheus is a

49
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,799
metric system you just saw my talk those

50
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,170
of you are here and metrics give you

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,049
breaths not deaths in flux I see is

52
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,519
actually an event logging system sort of

53
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,560
the log system that's actually are also

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,350
fairly good at doing metrics like it can

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,330
ingest graphic data but it's

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,860
fundamentally is an event logging system

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,750
not a metric system so that's kind of

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,879
how I see a difference and then like

59
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,890
capacitor I would like it is fairly

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,260
powerful but like all the things people

61
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,430
say with me it doesn't scale

62
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,830
horizontally it turns out yeah capacitor

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,480
uses the exact same way as skating out

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,190
that Prometheus does which is you get to

65
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,260
vertically shard which I find amusing

66
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,940
and so that's the way it seemed like if

67
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,140
you're looking at something like say

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,290
IOT the obvious choice there is in flux

69
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,730
all are living equal because that's

70
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,650
general tend to be event logging if

71
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,909
you're looking for a general monitoring

72
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,489
system you know I would suggest for me

73
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,890
is what I have meatiest developer do but

74
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,349
I'd say I would say thanks question

75
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,239
about alerting

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,010
in the latest saravana I want to have

77
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,190
some template for many many servers and

78
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,980
have at least when I receive I left

79
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,049
notify a notification I want to see the

80
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,510
host name what host name is - is it

81
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,129
possible to make I don't think I quite

82
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,470
understand a question I think the

83
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,180
questions he has a kind of dashboards

84
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,180
and winning it has alerts he wants to

85
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,650
know what house name created the alert

86
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,769
so so alerts in Gravano right now only

87
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,069
support Syria names and not tags like

88
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,260
server know there's something like that

89
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,390
eventually the alerting will also

90
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,750
support tags you can include know there

91
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,519
are Siri name or data center or

92
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
something like that but right now you

93
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,480
would have to format the legend to

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,269
contain the server name or data sense or

95
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,530
something like that I'm not sure if that

96
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,129
answer you

97
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,430
you could use a wildcards query it's

98
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,560
saying in graphite you would place a

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,740
star where the server is and then only

100
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,010
the series violating the threshold will

101
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,590
be included in that learn so if you have

102
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,180
ten thousand servers and two of them

103
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,460
have high CPU or something that you want

104
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,340
an alert on then Holy Ghost series will

105
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,310
be present in alert I have a question

106
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,620
regarding graph another sink as well

107
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,490
what is the roadmap for development of

108
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,139
distributed others in California the

109
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:04,820
roadmap will be presented later yeah I

110
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,850
don't wanna take bits of my talk off

111
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,020
right now if that's okay it'll say for

112
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,520
happened to be utter monitoring system

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
altars here as well this is the

114
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,190
monitoring track not to provide you some

115
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,539
profound track so come down

116
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,759
in Flex DB has pretty weird attention

117
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,569
schema and girl fauna doesn't work with

118
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,360
his retentions within flex DB how and

119
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,369
who will solve this problem when you

120
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,009
want to make some aggregation and of all

121
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,719
the metrics and just see them with the

122
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,460
same dashboard instead of creating

123
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,080
different dashboards for different time

124
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,499
periods so the question was about

125
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,839
retention policies in Flex to be tenant

126
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,119
Ravana right so we have been talking

127
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,099
with the influx data team and we have

128
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,349
not found a common way of making that

129
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,969
configurable in some ways so right now

130
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,050
you would have to configure each

131
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,740
dashboard for certain policies and

132
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,930
that's very cumbersome you could use

133
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,099
interval templates or something like

134
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,379
that for the policy selection but

135
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,789
there's no automated way

136
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,099
hello yeah what's the ETA on retention

137
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,419
for Prometheus I had one time that's

138
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,289
only a few days or a few weeks I know

139
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,779
either in unlimited retention from from

140
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,849
is Earth so do we need to put in place a

141
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,199
strategy to back up the data so the

142
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,949
question is Prometheus and long-term

143
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,279
data storage basically so the thing is

144
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,469
that Prometheus is designed for

145
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,270
reliability which is different from

146
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,139
durability and basically if you want to

147
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,460
have infinite retention that means

148
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,319
you're basically creating a distributed

149
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,389
storage system which is really really

150
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,729
really hard and in the context of

151
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,310
monitoring unreliable because you want a

152
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,659
monitoring system that if your network

153
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,969
starts falling apart it still keeps on

154
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,520
working so our approach to this is to

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,229
see the storage for medias more as a

156
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,210
cache which might be a few weeks of the

157
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,699
cache and then there's something else

158
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,639
which has that a long term so our

159
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,620
strategy is because we want to base B

160
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,729
total time to build one of these are

161
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,710
cells are busy with other stuff that we

162
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,379
will have interfaces and so there's all

163
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,960
ready to promote write code and it's

164
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,430
been there a few months now so

165
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,779
Prometheus can write out to another

166
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,479
system and that mode would like there's

167
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,039
weave works cortex which is an open

168
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,680
source and that can accept this data and

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,449
as other systems as well as you build

170
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,939
there and we're also some voids going to

171
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,979
add the read path as well which can read

172
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,569
the data back in so you can

173
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,969
transparently access your data and then

174
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,319
you know you can basically have

175
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,939
separation concerns that all your alerts

176
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,560
are based on the cache which is all

177
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,389
local all cypher media is all reliable

178
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,009
and if you want to go back more than a

179
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,629
few weeks or whatnot you can have the

180
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,240
rouse the unreliable query to your

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,159
long-term storage and if that's broken

182
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,020
well you've just lost graphing until you

183
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,310
fix that but you haven't affected your

184
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,589
cornering abilities but a date is that

185
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,819
this will be a separation concerns

186
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,800
between greediest and long-term storage

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,710
because we don't want that sort of CP

188
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,929
system with strong consistency when we

189
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,429
care about availability for well

190
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,140
alerting because I shouldn't use the

191
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,490
word monitoring after my own talk

192
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,960
alerting and

193
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,220
critical dashboards but not trending

194
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,510
next question never when I raise the mic

195
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,160
you can just raise your head then

196
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,620
because that saves time and just to be

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,270
clear day we head to the projector

198
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,680
working again because I've had time

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,820
slots work we need to use up time if you

200
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,700
have your own cell matrix storage you

201
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
have to read the system for analytics

202
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,530
because we're vigilant and storage

203
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,010
result large-scale analytics doesn't

204
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,570
that make sense no sorry can you repeat

205
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,580
the question a little closer to measure

206
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,900
okay with the wrong time mr wegg without

207
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,930
mass analytics using MapReduce or a

208
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,330
framework it doesn't make sense because

209
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,230
okay you feel better upright but we are

210
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,540
not very very capita bility to retrieve

211
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,690
it and analyze it simply no I think the

212
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,690
question was that only I think the

213
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,220
question was that only having long-term

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,230
storage without having a and ability

215
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,860
capability of Prometheus wouldn't work

216
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,200
at the answer is you should know this is

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,530
good

218
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,390
can you please stop talking or leave

219
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:15,140
thank you so I say the question was if I

220
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,330
write out over this remote White Pass

221
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,630
how do I read back the data what's that

222
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:30,470
the question okay so so basically answer

223
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,850
right now is that we have three males so

224
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,950
JP I said that you write out data in

225
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,880
arbitrary systems but there's no read

226
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,220
back API yet at this point I'm sort of

227
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,830
you can build your own on your own

228
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,240
remote storage integration but there's

229
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,100
no generic read paths at this point but

230
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,610
there will be hopefully within the CM is

231
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,650
a long time goal to work side by side

232
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,690
with traditional monitoring and alerting

233
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,000
systems like icinga well it's the

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,990
long-term goal to replace these tools I

235
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,270
would pretty clearly say it's they go to

236
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,910
replace these yeah okay I mean this

237
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,650
thing is mostly focused on checks and

238
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,660
alerting so my talk kind that goes into

239
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,700
this like what our approach is to sort

240
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,230
of solve this problem in a different way

241
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,140
so we're gonna come around later for

242
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,570
this talk you will see more so I have to

243
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,860
see your talk okay yeah I guess

244
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,209
does your talk also cover multi

245
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,569
datacenter application monitoring

246
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,850
I mean it's serious you will see that

247
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,619
the concept is kind of agnostic of that

248
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:43,189
right foot totally work and in in like I

249
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:45,139
want two sentences the basic ideas we

250
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,579
connect time series data and then we

251
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,429
have sort of our state of truth in terms

252
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,439
of sample data and then we can define

253
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,419
the writing on top of that and about

254
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,889
what we collect this data and how we

255
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,109
collect it it's completely separated

256
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,179
from the alerting layer it's sort of the

257
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:04,129
short story is what's mostly interesting

258
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,949
in this because what you have is multi

259
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:09,919
data centers hosting one application and

260
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,589
then how do you alert on what's going

261
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:15,529
wrong yeah I mean so Prometheus is

262
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,059
collecting time series data right so

263
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,009
Prometheus can monitor much for the data

264
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,600
centers they are like patterns how to

265
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,730
set it up and then we have time series

266
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,589
data and this is completely separated

267
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,359
from it and on top of that we define the

268
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,769
lower things so as to ice every

269
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,389
monitoring system that can connect time

270
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,929
series data in multi data center sort of

271
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,319
playoffs you can also load on it so

272
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,360
editing with Prometheus is if you can

273
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,100
graph on this you can alert solution and

274
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,319
you can certainly graph multi data

275
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,879
center metrics like they can see and so

276
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,069
on there are some reliability questions

277
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,350
about you know being time to be bound to

278
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,970
those data centers being up in order to

279
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,889
be able to be the nursing as well I

280
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,360
would generally advise as much as

281
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,959
possible

282
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,579
push dealers down to the data center

283
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,619
level to avoid the LAN links being on

284
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,989
your critical paths for alerts but if

285
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,519
you want to inertia like global latency

286
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,379
you can just be aware of reliability

287
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,869
implications that - depending on how you

288
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,730
do that you might get no alerts if your

289
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,999
networks dodgy what's to request so

290
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,259
extracting metrics from logs obviously

291
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,209
isn't ideal like lots of logs metrics of

292
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,129
metrics to your earlier point but in

293
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,629
terms of support for doing stuff like

294
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:22,939
that anyway these support tools like

295
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,009
logs - that kind of stuff as well so

296
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,139
long term stash is just a transport

297
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,499
layer and as fluent ears just moves data

298
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:33,410
from A to B so as I said in my talk long

299
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,660
story for breaths

300
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,010
so for depth and

301
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,110
down bred by depths you'll end up with

302
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,970
much information but in four communities

303
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,830
two tools have been written called the

304
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,980
croc exporter and M tail googles M tail

305
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,740
which can do that and fluency might also

306
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,600
be getting support to extract some

307
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,060
metrics logs because my stance on it is

308
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,070
like it's know if you want logs use logs

309
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,990
you won't use math tricks use metrics if

310
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,600
you only have logs well at least try to

311
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,710
get some metrics although most we can

312
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,660
fix things to be proper because let's be

313
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,310
honest the world isn't perfect you need

314
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,290
tools like these sometimes and it's

315
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,760
still the only way to discover this

316
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,730
failures is actually logs we've checked

317
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,380
clinics at least when I check to three

318
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,610
years ago Linux the knowledge sports

319
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,560
metrics to let you know if it is to fail

320
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,330
your only choice is looking for syslog

321
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,950
you know all those messages MIT is

322
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,600
failing that's how you find them only

323
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:38,900
way like now yours or less important

324
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,440
ones like usinga if you have an

325
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,630
environment which is absolutely not

326
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,710
cloud native and it's even not

327
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,510
distributed to a lot of systems but

328
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,190
consists of industrial controllers

329
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,460
robots whatever boxes which can be

330
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,750
checked with a small script very easily

331
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,920
how do you think you can you replace all

332
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,590
this knowledge that has been built up in

333
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,740
the last years you can't write exporters

334
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,810
for everything

335
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,610
Ritchie wants answered our as someone

336
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,870
who's not working at a cloud native

337
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,590
company yes so if the if you have

338
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,500
caching concepts in your in your

339
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,910
monitoring where you basically have some

340
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,130
notes which cache for you for higher

341
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,310
level of monitoring notes you have to

342
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,870
take that into account but it works you

343
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,430
just have to plan for it accordingly but

344
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,030
yes so even without anything dynamic or

345
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,580
even with really old legacy applications

346
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,920
we see huge benefits with promises and

347
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,100
performer a huge

348
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,740
so a little secret is that per medias

349
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,170
doesn't know what a container is

350
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,189
Prometheus does not know what a cloud is

351
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,999
per medias just has labels would you put

352
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,819
your own ideas onto so if you want to

353
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:01,160
monitor actual hardware you can like

354
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,569
I've got a Prometheus running at home

355
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,399
monitors like tree machines in the

356
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,860
switch don't ask why it's out of 48

357
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,649
ports which at home but like you can do

358
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,329
all these things wanting to watch though

359
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,850
is the trade-offs we make are the

360
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,199
engineering trade-offs around alcohol

361
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,509
we're losing a little bit of data is

362
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,670
better than losing monitoring if you're

363
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,069
talking industrial control like actual

364
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,829
industrial control I would be evaluating

365
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,019
fermius very carefully to see if the

366
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,149
trade-offs we've made which make total

367
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,709
sense from talking about web servers or

368
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,329
network switches whether those

369
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,100
trade-offs also make sense an industrial

370
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,199
control sense because we have made

371
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,119
trade-offs there in terms of precision

372
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:43,279
just to get better availability well you

373
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,829
have any idea how memory intensive I can

374
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,259
permit is get I think I have a VPS

375
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,149
there's a limited amount of memory and I

376
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,889
was pretty surprised that I made about

377
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,649
100 lines in the metrics file starting

378
00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:00,040
like memory that seems quite loud

379
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,170
research this recently so the default

380
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,029
for Prometheus uses about four gigs of

381
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,849
RAM passive one for these days it's

382
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,260
probably down spider shrieks ish but

383
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,520
special vlog there's Nashville there on

384
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,949
it how much RAM this for me yeah also

385
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,159
you might have to look at the storage

386
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,199
flex right there like several knobs you

387
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,909
can configure two ways you tweak the

388
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,909
memory usage at runtime we kind of know

389
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:29,539
that's not ideal

390
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,460
and so actually we're working on a new

391
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,990
storage layer actually have the

392
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,779
benchmark running right now so hopefully

393
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,090
we're gonna cut down memory usage by I

394
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,690
don't know like 70 or 5% or something so

395
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,760
everything goes right who definitely go

396
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,129
down significantly in the next month

397
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,970
could the next speaker get hooked in

398
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,260
because we've got like five minutes into

399
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,930
the next talk whoever the next speaker

400
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:10,400
is so I think we can fish in one more

401
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
question follows next speakers get ready

402
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,950
more like so first there was a request

403
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,700
about putting up the slides right now so

404
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,950
people can look at them we will hand

405
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,580
them over to to our back office so to

406
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,230
speak and they'll put the link of the

407
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,900
presentation into the description of the

408
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,880
problem so if you want just want to look

409
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,700
at the slides you can go there and while

410
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,380
we are waiting show of hands who is

411
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:46,940
using nachos who's using a singer who's

412
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:53,500
using zabbix yay who's using prometheus

413
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,950
who's using graphite who's using

414
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:06,320
grandfather do you see that anything

415
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,840
else which I should ask or mocks -

416
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,980
Greylock that didn't work out the way

417
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,139
you wanted

418
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:25,289
what RTG well mrtg yeah with a crank on

419
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,350
it
