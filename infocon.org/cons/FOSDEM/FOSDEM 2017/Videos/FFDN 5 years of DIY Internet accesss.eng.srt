1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,750
okay hello in Frankfurt and Inga so I'm

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,059
going to talk about FF DN which is a

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:13,750
Federation of Duty or self ISPs the

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,570
original took a speaker : Saturn so I'm

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,119
replacing him first of all yeah so we

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,399
will have a slight shift in flight but

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,969
not much - away as I said we have

8
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,239
federation of ISPs but these IPS are all

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,590
very non-commercial all targeted and

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,480
made for do-it-yourself we we want to

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,000
make things ourselves to control them -

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,480
you know what's going on to not be just

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,850
subscribers in the biggest people we

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,160
also want to driven and which way to be

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,060
human-sized that matters a lot because

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,460
we aim for a space where people know

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,270
each other where you don't simply do

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,209
things because somebody the other side

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,880
of France has asked you to do it and we

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,310
want to make some Network some human

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,359
network - we have no employees that's

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,549
that helps being something you man and

23
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,999
also net net neutrality proponents

24
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,439
meaning with your best for tubers fights

25
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,770
the bad laws which we see and to provide

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,109
our subscribers with everything they

27
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:38,170
need for proper internet access yeah

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,340
unfortunately as I said so that the the

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,389
map at the beginning

30
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:47,380
it shows the ISPs which are members of

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,279
fdn so it's a blue dots orange dots are

32
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,139
Willett a tree fiddy n-bit and not a SPG

33
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,529
is a sense of fdn as you can see we are

34
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,689
both in Belgium and all across France

35
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,340
and if you want you can do on DB dot f

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,240
FD n dot org

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,580
and you will have the map the intuitive

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,410
map in which you can zoom you can get

39
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,829
details on each dots and with laying

40
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,239
some statues for everyone

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,610
well we started in 2011

42
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,620
back then we had only seven dogs and

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,790
roughly half a thousand members unfuck

44
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,650
you later we are more than four times as

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,520
big we have a very strong core and they

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,100
were chief co or 50 to 60 people

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,080
I would publish say more than that

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,340
actually but that's conservative and

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,980
that doesn't count people who achieve

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,800
inside DSPs and not at the fdn level so

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,890
even more than that for some background

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,160
this was started by an ASP which is

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,750
named fdn 25 years ago now and it's the

54
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,510
oldest I ASP influence which is still

55
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,860
running commercial or non-commercial so

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,640
our girls when we do all of that first

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
want to be an alternative to larger a

58
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,130
SPS we don't say exactly what

59
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,350
alternatives that's H ASP which is

60
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,600
inside FF v n which they decide what

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,270
they will do how they will do it which

62
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,570
services it will offer to the members

63
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,260
and how they arrange for everything one

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,720
common point though is that we want to

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,180
connect dark zones which are zone mostly

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,950
in the countryside with a really poor

67
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,690
international access or no Internet

68
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,530
access and we try to prevent people from

69
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,190
being kept unconnected basically that

70
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,540
it's not because they are outside of a

71
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,040
big city that they shouldn't have an

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,160
internet connection we also want to

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,540
decentralize ISPs meaning we have ISPs

74
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,690
in many places and we don't want all the

75
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,930
traffic to go through Paris basically we

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,548
want the Internet to be really decent

77
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:19,029
relized

78
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,399
as it was meant to be that it was cut

79
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,419
with sorry

80
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,690
it was built and we don't want to have

81
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,300
only a single place which through which

82
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,530
all the traffic goes

83
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,680
and at the same time we also do that at

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,340
the level of each subscriber because we

85
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,170
promote self-hosting we make it possible

86
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,450
for everyone to self host by providing

87
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,180
things like static IP is ipv4 and ipv6

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,830
the net neutrality part where we don't

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,510
block traffic or discriminate traffic

90
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,430
meaning you can host everything you want

91
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,580
in the in the ISPs on your connection

92
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,420
the last part is that we cannot simply

93
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,440
provide a service and provide or make

94
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,960
software or whatever we also have to

95
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,910
think about the lows especially the ones

96
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,650
that are being applied right now we

97
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,960
believe that too many lows that I don't

98
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,800
use so we want to fight them and we also

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,100
fight what I we sell publication of lows

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,480
when people don't get in a prediction

101
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,950
where they should simply because it's

102
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,890
simpler to do the stupid but safe things

103
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:40,340
for large ISPs and we have quite a few

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,710
working groups so the first thing to

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,290
embrace again that we are Federation we

106
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,419
do it on a federation level and each

107
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,890
face piece still has its own task and on

108
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,169
whatever you wants to do so these are

109
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,600
the three versions are not each share

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,050
space first one is with telecom

111
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,140
wiedersehen

112
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,479
we have IP VT and a step so Belgium in

113
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,840
France national regulators they work for

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,530
something at the EU level and we put

115
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,880
them with feedback basically when they

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,350
ask questions about how is the mecca

117
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,820
doing we tell them poorly basically

118
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,380
sometimes we also have to complain

119
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,810
because they didn't listen to us and we

120
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,030
have a near monopoly situation

121
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,500
especially in the optic fiber in France

122
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,419
another one is that we teach people

123
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,280
inside the Federation we want to share

124
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,030
knowledge about

125
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,100
how you make an ISP how you burn it how

126
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,080
you make the finance but how you make

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,500
the they say this season mean but

128
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,170
everything that can be beneficial to

129
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,020
share between the fair the ISPs we want

130
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,770
to do it yeah so legal stuff fun stuff I

131
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,220
would say because we have an issue that

132
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,520
larger spheres want to save on us or at

133
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,290
least a business and it won't want to

134
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,030
protect people which is what we want to

135
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,500
do so we have to spend more time and to

136
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,840
be the first ones to understand our laws

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,600
or national laws or you they achieve

138
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,420
them to be sure that we don't over apply

139
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,010
over interpret the laws we want to do

140
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,070
the minimum that abide by the law but

141
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,430
still respect our members so the main

142
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,560
things which we are against data

143
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
retention interceptions and that means

144
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,760
to achieve blocking if you go to a large

145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,500
ISP is usually a nice to achieve

146
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,900
blocking they will do it just on

147
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,710
whenever asked will fight will go

148
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,670
against if you want well if you can but

149
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,010
it's true that we are out because we are

150
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,050
not a large ISP we are not large is

151
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,200
piece away and usually we are not big

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,730
enough to to make our rulers bother with

153
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,700
them with with us so exact is a working

154
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,900
group which so as I say tech geek from

155
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,190
FF VN and lo geeks from L Chilean

156
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,180
Giuliani's like for children it

157
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,850
so I call them look logics because I

158
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,620
think there are basically 20 debug the

159
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,660
law it's basically taking you the same

160
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,299
approach as we software whatever but

161
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,010
applied to law really understand what's

162
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,919
going on what how it's not working and

163
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,340
what has to be fixed that basically

164
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,480
complaint your code of justice - I -

165
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,390
when doesn't succeed escalate it and so

166
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,320
on and you get a few few news from them

167
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,690
in in the media

168
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,840
oh yeah and actually I would say that

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,160
the real way we do all of that is that

170
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
we care for each other

171
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,590
we do whatever we can't you share

172
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,720
together we have an excited group of six

173
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,050
key people something like that and we

174
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,390
usually have more than almost always

175
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,060
have more than a couple people working

176
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,390
on a given topic meaning you can we can

177
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,330
change people who work on them we can we

178
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,490
don't really burn out because of that

179
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,530
and we always have support in the

180
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:34,020
community and since it first day I'm I'm

181
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,630
going to talk about our relation to free

182
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,140
software you must probably know why you

183
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,720
should use free software so it's the

184
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,220
knowledge kings there's no stupid

185
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,080
licensing teams and with whatever you

186
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,940
can win software for no for one year but

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,020
not more and especially the Noven dough

188
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,680
specific hardware part because that some

189
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,190
of our hardware so it's as I said it's

190
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,180
free community hardware so inexpensive

191
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,450
can be given by companies which help us

192
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,310
so Murray helps avoiding costs and

193
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,900
that's another one which we can use

194
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,410
which is a quite a bit smaller but still

195
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,870
very efficient from PC and joints for

196
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,560
instance and we can ruin the same things

197
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,800
on it that one can actually win VPN at

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,440
six megabyte per second I think about

199
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,580
the software that we use yeah once again

200
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,610
we are a Federation we also welcome new

201
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,800
new ISPs but each ISP can use it to eat

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,010
forms we don't have a specific set we

203
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,589
don't force a specific set we tend to

204
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,950
share the ones which were useful in

205
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,560
command but we don't force anything we

206
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,500
are quite a few and studying for

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,960
subscribe activity

208
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,070
since we do DSL we have a few stuff like

209
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,050
HTTP and pppoe I'm not going to go

210
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,250
through the list in details but the

211
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,010
important part that we use a lot of them

212
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,990
we have to authenticate users we have to

213
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,130
refer that one between sites handle DSL

214
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,000
lines we also have to endure our own

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,050
machines - that's part of ISP service we

216
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,560
do name servers we do medically

217
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,380
unfiltered my uncensored weather name

218
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,560
servers we have some which open on the

219
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,260
internet with weight limiting yeah we

220
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,020
will use a lot of that for instance we

221
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,470
even have to use HTTP andouille bar for

222
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,430
our accounting part so it's pretty a

223
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,820
wide wide spectrum and once again yeah

224
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,060
some web projects and I don't really

225
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,830
talk about it but we have where your

226
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,720
links which were used for the remote

227
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,040
access lots of you open whe and I say

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,170
ubiquity even it's it's not really

229
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:35,180
completely free software usually yeah so

230
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,430
we also provide services for members and

231
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,580
subscribers so that can be imaged we

232
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,770
host our mailing list for collaboration

233
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,990
we also do a lot lot lot of

234
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,910
collaboration on each upper light

235
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,260
sometimes I feel like we are the biggest

236
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,630
users of it apart lights in the world

237
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,770
maybe yeah

238
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,120
simply a do-it-yourself one interesting

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,950
party that you can see please if you are

240
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,440
a member of one ISP you are missing a

241
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,090
service just do it

242
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,480
just come use the machines and is instil

243
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:27,820
it if you want as part of a space - we

244
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,090
created a few tools to help us where we

245
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,530
had gaps so tooth to vote and Quanah for

246
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,940
instance which is the tool to manage

247
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,940
members and subscriptions as I remember

248
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,490
it based on Django my it's quite modern

249
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,960
and can be used for pretty much any kind

250
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,040
of group with subscribers at the NDB is

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,520
the maps that we had at the beginning it

252
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,360
gives us it gives you the places where

253
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,910
you have a local ISP and whom you should

254
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,400
talk to when you are in a given spot or

255
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,010
a given City we also do have selects and

256
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,660
with you with me in order to be able to

257
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,080
put Wi-Fi antennas or other kind of

258
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,360
wireless links across across long

259
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,850
distances so for instance to link to

260
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,430
villages to churches we are going to

261
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,010
make sure that we can see each each

262
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,270
other easily that we don't have

263
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,050
obstacles or trees or anything and we

264
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,040
also got adopting projects which are

265
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,990
unmaintained because for instance for to

266
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,620
quiénes we need it for DSL it's quite

267
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,190
uncommon but we do need it and we also

268
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,740
get involved into projects like Debian

269
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,500
to make sure packages that we use

270
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,680
maintained and everything there's FD n

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,080
dot org which is which is a gird into

272
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,160
instance it has a number of projects you

273
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,630
can just go there and don't worry the

274
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,150
corrosion is only mine it's not as ugly

275
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:12,970
usually up so it yeah sometimes we get

276
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,370
asked if we really had to make our own

277
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,959
airspace

278
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,809
and I think we really had to and we

279
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:22,779
still have to because if you look at

280
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,240
further than I speak and do it can

281
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,319
insert ads that's especially true in in

282
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,869
the US apparently I don't know how they

283
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:36,220
stand it but it happens some sense a

284
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,619
wing bit and mr. Cheever because you sp

285
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,240
doesn't like what you are looking at

286
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:46,569
it's also helped mass severe civilians

287
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,589
we've we definitely don't want to have

288
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,759
that we might be in a position where we

289
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,619
cannot prevent it but at least we're not

290
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:59,290
helping it and finally they can also

291
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,730
hide actual traffic where a witchetty

292
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,600
advertising website when you have a

293
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,339
domain not found and stuff like that

294
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,679
it's very easy it happens all the time

295
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,899
as I said especially in the US so but

296
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,600
also in France we have a few bad stories

297
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,499
about each ASP each large ISP so we made

298
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:26,709
you our own I feel like it's something

299
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,990
we have in common with with free

300
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,809
software in general because we simply

301
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,749
don't twist the what we are given for

302
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:38,559
free on which we cannot see we can know

303
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,720
how it's working so we make our own you

304
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,089
can make you on to if you if you want

305
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,639
it's really not difficult and I would

306
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,139
say that it's also willing to have free

307
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,610
software and the internet have grown

308
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,240
during the past two decades both have

309
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,730
grown a lot lots and they could not have

310
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,890
existed one without the without the

311
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,990
other so that's it if you have any

312
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,950
question go on

313
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:23,839
[Applause]

314
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,580
so very clear the question is do you

315
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,930
help to create smaller space while new

316
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,240
smaller space and how do you manage the

317
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,950
fact that you are not going to start

318
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,590
making an autonomous system only for ten

319
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,100
people it's quite simple actually

320
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
because we are definitely going to help

321
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,950
to want to teach we want this to spread

322
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,770
and if you have a resource that you need

323
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,780
but which you cannot or fall or which

324
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,470
doesn't make sense in making at first

325
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,380
then we can share it we have a space

326
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,490
which don't have the IES themselves we

327
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,640
are they simply ish someone else or host

328
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,120
vm's the course networks there are some

329
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,360
things that can be shared and if you

330
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,300
don't want or cannot make them yourself

331
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:47,440
at first we share them is a question

332
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,700
other you are sure they don't do what

333
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,030
now is a very good question

334
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,430
input it we cannot really ensure that

335
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,840
our providers from for network traffic

336
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,690
and viewing won't do whatever the

337
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,730
commercial is please do but but it turns

338
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,340
out that they don't fully we might have

339
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,910
non perfect relationships with some but

340
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,090
we have a stronger commercial agreements

341
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,420
usually so they tend to not try to do

342
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,100
that but even then our first points to

343
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,900
the greater internet usually friendly

344
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,930
either groups or companies but in any

345
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:56,060
case at that point it's good to make

346
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,160
sure that you have an end-to-end

347
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,430
encryption and so on blocking it and

348
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,920
likely to happen and for instance the

349
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,340
DNS is usually not outside of one ispeed

350
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,600
infrastructure so that's good swatting

351
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,610
can but then we it's commercial stuff

352
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,129
and as for spying do into an encryption

353
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,770
tomato

354
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,460
so I'm not sure of something that checks

355
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,380
our providers are clean it's not

356
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,940
something automated for reason most

357
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,590
automated thing is that people start

358
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,690
 on Twitter when something goes

359
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,009
wrong and since we are not alone

360
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,549
we won't be the only one impacted you're

361
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,500
going to have companies in terms of

362
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,419
hosting sonson

363
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,539
so it's going to get noticed usually but

364
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:05,860
we don't have something automated for

365
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:29,169
that any question no I'm not to such

366
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:34,000
issues so so the question was whether we

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,220
were winning into cases where we are too

368
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,120
much traffic for setups BISM hardware or

369
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,110
software so no we don't have such issue

370
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,389
that I know well sometimes it's happened

371
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,000
but because some people have decided to

372
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,200
DDoS you but even then it's not I'm not

373
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,720
aware of such issues I'm not the one the

374
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,840
most involved in that part of the SPS

375
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,129
but haven't were had an issue myself

376
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:09,340
only heard about one DDoS last year that

377
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,850
was not very long that's high anyway so

378
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,360
in purchase no

379
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:29,880
well I suppose I know it's not by DNS

380
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,780
but block it and you get to choose what

381
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,929
happens is that if you are not among the

382
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,919
top three or four ISPs you basically get

383
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,410
you don't even get asked to do it there

384
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,190
are 1000 eyespace registered in front

385
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,710
more than that actually

386
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,130
they don't have to do that our domain

387
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,740
blocking stuff in France is definitely a

388
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,730
mess

389
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,150
it's only for the masses so if you don't

390
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,669
have five million subscribers you won't

391
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,730
get bothered by it and if you do what we

392
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,190
do which we can't you get a court order

393
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,580
to fix that I'm not saying we would fix

394
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,689
it but we try

395
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,030
interesting question event probably not

396
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,350
so should we make a kind of way on the

397
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,890
website

398
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,130
well fdn probably nuts HOAs please that

399
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,030
could be interesting at that point you

400
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,630
should ask Debra tree the airspace but

401
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,280
she I think it would be interesting to

402
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:15,360
you have something like that so do we

403
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
believe there should be no blocking at

404
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
all on the Internet's are the things

405
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,510
that should be blocked it's a good

406
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,950
question and my point on that is that

407
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,720
it's not really ours to decide what we

408
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,809
we already have a legal framework for

409
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:41,549
that we oppose the meaningless extension

410
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,840
of that but we have to abide by the law

411
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,820
so we can work on it work on making six

412
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,360
things better but we are not fully

413
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,679
trying to at least in effigy n to find

414
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,260
the best balance between between

415
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,080
blocking and the Phenom of freedom of

416
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,810
pitch that's all

417
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:17,429
[Applause]
