1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,510
thank you

2
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:14,540
okay

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,189
ah all right who's ready for a highly

4
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,669
chaotic talk and if anybody yeah fatty

5
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,250
if anybody knows me that's a it's gonna

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,020
do that my most chaotic talk yet and

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,579
that's a high barrier so so so hi I'm

8
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,440
Chris Webber so I'm here to talk about

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,720
network programming and etc live at the

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,289
repple and there's been a lot of stuff

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,289
happening in guile as in terms of like

12
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,820
asynchronous programming over the last

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,739
year one project is eight sync which I

14
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,870
work on myself which is a good new

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,079
project about asynchronous programming

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,550
you can see here if you go to the eight

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,800
sync homepage it's got a very short

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,659
example that if you just put in this

19
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,600
code you've written your own IRC BOTS

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,129
that you know you can customize what it

21
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,989
does right here so it's pretty easy to

22
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,360
get up and running and well you know so

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,180
each sync uses the actor model as its

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,490
met idea of how to do asynchronous

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,229
communication um this example that I

26
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,180
have here just starts up one IRC BOTS

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,180
but what's a more fun example where we

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,250
can have since actors I supposed to

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,200
involve lots of things running around we

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,110
can have many many crazy things going on

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,540
by the way in very soon people will be

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,950
able to connect to the game I'm going to

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,969
be running so if you want to pull out

34
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,770
your laptop's now there'll be a good

35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,229
time is in about 10 minutes we're gonna

36
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,369
be able to all go crazy so so yeah so I

37
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,140
wrote a multiplayer game for the list

38
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,670
game jam called mud sink it here has

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,770
ever played a mud or at least a text

40
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,560
adventure okay well actually a good

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,609
number of people in the room not

42
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,049
everybody but enough people right so

43
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,780
here is a mud think I'm actually

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,950
connected to this this is in the browser

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,990
so this is using apes Inc comes with

46
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,119
HTTP and WebSockets support so this is

47
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,369
using WebSockets so out of the box you

48
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,259
already get a web server and web socket

49
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,780
support and I'm inside of this room

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,030
let's see here at the hotel lobby so

51
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,290
this is going to be the most wall of

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,150
text conversation ever since I'm

53
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,340
literally playing a game with a ball of

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,480
text in it

55
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,980
I'm just gonna explain what's going on

56
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,120
because I don't expect people to be able

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,799
to read that fast so I'm in this hotel

58
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,209
I'm in this Lobby

59
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,010
there's a bunch of miscellaneous things

60
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,739
around what do I see here I see okay a

61
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,900
shiny brass bell so why don't I try ring

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,640
Bell okay

63
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,950
it summons this clerk who she's like

64
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,709
welcome to hotel bric-a-brac you know

65
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,840
and let's see what what information is

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,519
she giving me asked clerk about changing

67
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,260
name okay why don't we try that ask

68
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,640
clerk about changing name okay so I can

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,930
sign form as my name so sign form as see

70
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,750
Webber and now if I opened up a new tab

71
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,510
and also connected whoops and as I put

72
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,640
in a colon at the end of it I would see

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,780
that you know see Webber is here and

74
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,260
hi-c Webber and if I switch back I will

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,970
see the guest to said hi see Webber to

76
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,040
me right so and I saw guest to

77
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,480
materialize out of thin air oh yeah the

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,799
clerk kind of does some things in the

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,359
background she's clicking around and

80
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,549
stuff like that so now what else is in

81
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:23,000
this room

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,510
so I look there is this there is a curio

83
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,410
cabinet so look at cabinet ooh there's a

84
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,510
pickled head of Elvis in there oh great

85
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,840
so it's a and you know I can if I look

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,209
in here there's some sort of frumpy

87
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,790
fellow so look at the fellow it's

88
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,739
apparently the hotel proprietor they're

89
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,690
completely disorganized it's actually me

90
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,620
after the game jam I can chat with them

91
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,169
from the fellow I told him to paint the

92
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,489
more walls purple why didn't they listen

93
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,060
chat fellow you know just a bunch of BS

94
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,840
but anyway so I'm gonna go north and

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,459
what's here okay so I'm in this hallway

96
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,790
now it's got statues around everywhere

97
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,760
I've got in in the middle is at one

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,560
particularly large statue of this woman

99
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,060
and there's also a hotel map and then

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,889
the statue of HAC Athena which is the

101
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,260
woman so I'm gonna look I'm gonna read

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,470
the map and there's an ASCII art print

103
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,418
out of the environment okay so we can

104
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,210
see that we went from the lobby to here

105
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,120
okay excellent so you know there's no

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,860
mud unless if there's lots of fun

107
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,570
puzzles in it right so let's look at the

108
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,760
statue yeah

109
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,850
statue so the statue is of hack FINA

110
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,380
guardian of the hacker spirit the

111
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,910
protector of all good hats

112
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,440
she's got horns and a and instead of a

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
sword and a shield she's got a keyboard

114
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,370
and some sort of I don't know what that

115
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,230
is so let's look at the shield at the

116
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,690
keyboard oh it's a knight keyboard oh

117
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,250
man those are for oldest machines that's

118
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,840
pretty nice so she's got to be an Emacs

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,770
user so look at shield oh the shield's

120
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,090
unusual it's kind of a it looks like a

121
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,400
hard disk platter actually and it looks

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,590
loose so can we take shield from hexina

123
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,600
and I pull out it in a completely

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,510
separate copy if it comes off and I hear

125
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,490
a voice whisper share the software and

126
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,210
you'll be free hmm okay look at my

127
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,980
inventory I see I'm carrying a glowing

128
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,540
disk that's great look ya disk you know

129
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,580
it's just like the one that I had before

130
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,290
that's interesting okay I've seen enough

131
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,840
stuff here let's go west what's in this

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,580
room now I'm in a playroom

133
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,410
there's a Rube Goldberg machine a toy

134
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,030
chest and stuff what's inside the top of

135
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,890
the so there's like a cuddles plushie

136
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,120
look yeah plushie oh it's a cuttlefish

137
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,190
and it's warm and fuzzy I can take it no

138
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,700
take plushy right so I pick up a cuddles

139
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,180
flashy so but what else is in here

140
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,680
there's a Rube Goldberg machine okay

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,910
this is interesting look at machine it's

142
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,560
one of those hilarious through gobbler

143
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
machines what would happen if I started

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,390
that okay so start machine you start

145
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,800
through a go blur machine dominoes

146
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,390
toppled on the line laughs down with a

147
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,830
Lancet a switch switch lights an app

148
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,630
match lights a candle if the candle

149
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,240
burns and it just stops what happened

150
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,490
what happened so one of the difficult

151
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,780
things about doing asynchronous

152
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,210
programming stuff is that when things go

153
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,360
wrong like it's difficult to figure out

154
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,940
what happened it's difficult to kind of

155
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,520
evolve the system and it's you have to

156
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,230
close the whole damn thing down when

157
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,430
you've got all these useful things

158
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,080
running around I don't want to do that I

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,940
want to find out what's happening and I

160
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,530
want to fix it live so we're gonna do it

161
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,170
live alright so if I look at the output

162
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,510
it will print out an exception of what

163
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,160
happened and it caught the exception

164
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
known step type don't know how to

165
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,610
process Rube Goldberg machine step type

166
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,490
and it's got this step divided by two

167
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,500
and three huh what's going on here so

168
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,920
let's look at the code okay um well this

169
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,050
is my code for the rude goldberg item

170
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,460
trigger and you can see that it's got

171
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,770
this match here it knows how to handle

172
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,250
strings it knows how to handle numbers

173
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,590
it knows how to handle symbols so the

174
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,620
strings it'll spit stuff out numbers

175
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,390
it'll sleep for that many seconds and it

176
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,280
this happens all asynchronously so via

177
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,050
delimited continuations it'll suspend

178
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,370
the function and wake it up back again

179
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,520
when it needs to and that is doing that

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
with the sleep function the eat sleep

181
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,560
and then if it sees a symbol it actually

182
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,300
sends a message to the next object in

183
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,550
the Rube Goldberg machine saying you do

184
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,710
that you like perform your action so now

185
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,140
let's take a look at the candle which is

186
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,090
what broke so I've got my description of

187
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,810
the Rube Goldberg machine here I've got

188
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,430
the candle right here so here's the code

189
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,740
for the candle now you can see it says

190
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,860
the candle burns as the steps and then

191
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,380
you know and then ooh I've got made a

192
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,060
mistake so you can see it's a quasi

193
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,220
quote mistake classic mistake people who

194
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,990
use quasi code are always forgetting to

195
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,550
unquote things and that's me right now

196
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,690
right so so what happened here is if I

197
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,740
go - oops but I should have done is I

198
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,480
want to connect to the repple live of

199
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,300
this so Geyser connect local TMP 8 sync

200
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,640
socket so there's a ruffle running so i

201
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
can edit the program while it's running

202
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,419
so i'm gonna take a look and so here's

203
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,310
the code that it was evaluating for the

204
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,160
steps it sees this is what's happened is

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,980
instead of actually up doing the / 2 & 3

206
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,770
it actually just spit out that as a list

207
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,810
expression so I want to fix that what I

208
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,460
want to do is I want to unquote it here

209
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,549
okay I fixed that and now I want to I'm

210
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,140
going to inject as since now normally

211
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,849
you can just redefine things in eight

212
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,010
sync and if it's just like a function or

213
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,420
something like that it'll call the new

214
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,560
version of the function after you to

215
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,030
find it but in this case we actually

216
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,410
want to replace the object in the game

217
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,540
world this is a mud spacing specific

218
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,160
thing but it's easy to build something

219
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,810
like this in your 8 sink in or

220
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,220
you're a sink whatever it might not be a

221
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,840
game right so I'm gonna inject the game

222
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,360
object which is from this specification

223
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,430
I have which a new version of the candle

224
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,810
alright that's done

225
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,710
so now let's reset the machine okay my

226
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,000
hand comes out of the wall and puts

227
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,830
everything back in this place you chup

228
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,810
chup chup okay retreats back into the

229
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,750
wall let's run the machine again okay

230
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,010
start through your Goldberg machine

231
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,870
Domino's top style of line last time to

232
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,490
lands land switch light master candle

233
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,740
candle burns candle is burning away a

234
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,240
rope we fixed at the road snaps

235
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,610
unleashes a catapult the rock flies

236
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,230
through water demon startling it the

237
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,670
water starts leaking water into the

238
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,380
kettle below the rock hits the quick

239
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,839
heaters on button the quick heater fits

240
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,400
it heats up the kettle below it the

241
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,230
kettle is filled the kettle keeps up and

242
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,640
it's boiled some water and it spits out

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,520
a cup of hot tea and there's a cup of

244
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,270
hot tea I'm gonna take that sip tea I

245
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,900
can also drink the tea oh that drinks it

246
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,610
all at once now I don't have any more

247
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,430
tea anyway okay so alright so that

248
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,720
that's fun that's fun so you know okay

249
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
well let's go east again and look at the

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,020
map so read map okay so the playrooms to

251
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,610
the left ooh a computer room well we got

252
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,440
that hard disk I wonder go west go west

253
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,060
of course there's a large computer

254
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,570
cabinet here and a hard drive go figure

255
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,670
what's let's take a look at the computer

256
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,580
at computer it's a PDP 11.5 and it looks

257
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,990
like it's ready just run a program on it

258
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,060
if I also look at the groom it says that

259
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,560
there's a direction down but there is a

260
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,600
metal panel in the floor and I can't get

261
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,920
through the metal panel but that's a

262
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,060
problem because that's where my main

263
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,370
talk is all the actually good stuff

264
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,660
about my talk were just playing a video

265
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,770
game now we haven't even gotten in the

266
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,800
talk it's downstairs so I have to solve

267
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,720
a puzzle before I can do this okay so

268
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,410
let's look at computer it says I can run

269
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,750
a program on it's a run program on

270
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,230
computer oh it errors out because of a

271
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,740
disk error so what's wrong with the disk

272
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,940
look at disk okay earth it's oh wait

273
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,580
wait no look at drive

274
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,500
disk and drive so confusing so it's a

275
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,290
hard drive labeled Arles euro 2.5 oh

276
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,269
that's the same thing that our disc that

277
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,100
we're holding is and it's under a metre

278
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,660
tall there's a slot where a disk platter

279
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,160
could be inserted so what should we do

280
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,839
what do we do right insert disk into

281
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,860
drive a load button begins to glow okay

282
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,130
look at Drive okay Road button is

283
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,959
glowing and there's a ready an indicator

284
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,860
that's unlit so let's press the load

285
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,540
button on Drive hard to spin up and the

286
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,950
ready light turns on alright now we can

287
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,920
run that computer program run program on

288
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,170
computer an imperial panel opens up and

289
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,950
we can go down hooray so we can go down

290
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,209
and I'm in an underground laboratory

291
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,450
which has a map read map ooh we have a

292
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,070
whole ask yard map of the underground

293
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,730
area that we can explore it's roguelike

294
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,930
style but you know this is probably the

295
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,339
time where I should get you guys to kit

296
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,470
and get involved right let's so I'm

297
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,410
gonna go back and go back I'm going to

298
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,470
go back to this where it all started at

299
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,490
the lobby and I'm gonna let you all

300
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,529
connect now if you're going to connect

301
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,029
don't be an

302
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,380
like sometimes you put things up here

303
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,060
and people are like I'm gonna say sexist

304
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,709
or like super douche-baggy things sit

305
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,149
you can say silly things but don't be a

306
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,920
douchebag okay I'll just kill the

307
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,480
connection for everybody and you'll ruin

308
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,220
it for everybody so don't do that so I'm

309
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,440
opening up an SSH tunnel to my laptop

310
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,569
SSH ad

311
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,829
which I'm going to type wrong okay now

312
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,029
I'm gonna open up an SSH tunnel

313
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,500
suspense it's connected okay all right

314
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,410
so now everyone can go to dusty cloud

315
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,090
org : 8 8 8 8 4 8 sync four times a

316
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,980
dusty cloud that are : 8 8 8 8

317
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,270
and you should appear in a lobby let's

318
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,800
see who starts appearing you see guest

319
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,350
ok everybody's appearing so what so ok

320
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm gonna I'm gonna summon I'm gonna

321
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,790
summon the the desk clerk again so she

322
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,330
can help

323
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,610

computer room so I'm gonna go off by the

351
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,510

352
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,480
to this secret location here and she

353
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
will do something hilarious if you

354
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,130
summon her while she's in the room but

355
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,210
but I'm not gonna do that

356
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,770
this is a choose-your-own-adventure talk

357
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,330
I've put in more content than I can

358
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,280
possibly cover so if you want to see

359
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,930
something else in the talk that I'm not

360
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,490
going to be able to get to just walk to

361
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,020
that area and read all the notes I've

362
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,010
left so so go west okay so I'm gonna go

363
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,520
downstairs so I went what Northwest West

364
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,230
and then down and that's where you get

365
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,940
to the underground lab if you have any

366
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,880
doubts read the map and up above so read

367
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,800
nap we'll see who gets to be the first

368
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,200
person who joins me here Oh Momo joins

369
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,150
me first first person in the lab okay so

370
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,980
what's here so what do people want to

371
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,660
hear about most do you want to look go

372
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,830
to should we go to the eighth sync hive

373
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,880
area the guille

374
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,590
eighth sync is a sync Museum the

375
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,020
Federation station or the mud sing swamp

376
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,730
I don't have to program that one so it

377
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,460
just stopped exists so so how about

378
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,350
North since its opposite of South okay

379
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,040
so let's go north and here is we're at

380
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,750
the entrance to the eight sync hives so

381
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,030
it's got this large spherical Half Dome

382
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,060
and there's a bunch of actors like fused

383
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,650
to the side of it and like with things

384
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,630
attached their belly buttons and they've

385
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,520
got like messages pulsating on to them

386
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,350
and those are actors right so this is

387
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,240
eight thing so I'm gonna chat with an

388
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,790
actor and they'll say stuff like yeah we

389
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,870
go through a lot of sleep and weight

390
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,460
cycles around here if you're not busy

391
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,050
processing you message so if you chat

392
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,340
with them they kind of give details

393
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,840
about how aids sync works and kind of

394
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,450
jokey ways what allows you schedule I

395
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,070
hope somebody upgrades that thing you

396
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,120
add shirts so so so what is this thing

397
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,740
about the eat sink I've I mean we know

398
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,330
what actors are and by the way every

399
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,280
game object in this game is its own

400
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,070
individual actor acting independently so

401
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,110
they all operate separately if they're

402
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,490
doing their own things they won't

403
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,510
interrupt each other it's all

404
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,200
non-blocking

405
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,480
so if I

406
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,339
but so we're at the entrance to the ate

407
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,660
sink hi but it looks like we can go

408
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,310
inside the hive itself so I'm gonna go

409
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,769
north into the hive and so we're inside

410
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,449
the H sink hive Wow everything's so

411
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,250
goopy around here oh is that sanitary

412
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,000
yes so eight sink uses goop's

413
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,380
and for those who don't know what goop's

414
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,790
is goop's is a so let's look at the RGB

415
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,689
item oops

416
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,319
so RGB item yes so goopes is a it's

417
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,400
basically a object oriented like class

418
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,760
based structure for for scheme you can

419
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,980
use it in a fairly kind of imperative

420
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,440
fashion there I did have a patch to the

421
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,820
list that allows you to use in a more

422
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,500
functional fashion faction kind of like

423
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,660
surf e9 canoe but what's nice about it

424
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,700
is that when you redefine things they

425
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,380
will like if you add new fields or

426
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,760
change things about an object it won't

427
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,220
break the existing objects that's really

428
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,750
good for life hacking so that's why we

429
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,169
use Y all actors are based on goop's so

430
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:51,190
you know so that's why there's a you

431
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,780
know sub beeps so the so that's why if

432
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,280
we look here there's this character

433
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,700
called the hive actor so we can look at

434
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,179
the hive actor so every actor in eight

435
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,160
sync is connected to the hive what is

436
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,970
the hive well let's look at hive actor

437
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,299
it's a so what the hive actor does in my

438
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,070
personified version of it is it's a

439
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,350
tentacle monster here that's also itself

440
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,330
an actor but it's consuming messages

441
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,090
that are dropped on it's not about desk

442
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,250
and then shooting those messages off to

443
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,540
other actors so that's what the hive

444
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,850
does it's basically the male agent of

445
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,190
the entire thing it's actually the one

446
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,990
that's sending messages so this is an

447
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,850
important thing about eight sink is that

448
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,020
since it's following the actor model

449
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,740
it's all message passing and if we look

450
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,230
we can chat with the hive actor too he

451
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,240
yells though your fibers is a nice

452
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,040
work-stealing system but the proprietor

453
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,480
is not convinced that our design will

454
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
corrupt actors made and that in the

455
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,780
actress threatened to strike when it

456
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,200
came up last okay so what a jerk so

457
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,580
there's a straight message on the floor

458
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,540
yeah

459
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,590
stray message

460
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,610
something strange has happened to the

461
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,200
fabric of space and time around the

462
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,460
message is floating right above the

463
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,929
horror and it hasn't been garbage

464
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,030
collected but if we try to read it it

465
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,880
might print itself out so read message

466
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,620
so this is doing something hilarious

467
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,289
through this error in space-time this is

468
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,970
actually the message that was sent to

469
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,789
the actor asking for us to read it and

470
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,380
so it's actually printing out the

471
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,299
message that it got as a hilarious joke

472
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,130
in the game so now we can read exactly

473
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,070
what it was so so you can see the

474
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,190
message has its own ID every message has

475
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,010
an individual ID it gets addressed to

476
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,620
something so the qu the every actor has

477
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,450
two parts of its components for its

478
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,429
address it has the player ID and it has

479
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,570
the it has the hive ID and E and you can

480
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,400
see that it's this message is coming

481
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,010
from it's being delivered to this meta

482
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,110
message object but it's also coming from

483
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,320
the player who is me but they both share

484
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,570
the same hive ID now in the program that

485
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,190
I'm running here there's only one hive

486
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,919
but what you could do is you could set

487
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,480
up multiple hives so say you wanted to

488
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,370
run things in multiple threads or even

489
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,409
multiple processes on completely

490
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,299
different servers you could have a

491
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,580
separate hive over there and the actors

492
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,929
could send messages to each other and

493
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,370
they wouldn't even know unless if they

494
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,750
bothered to look at the hive component

495
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,610
of ID that they were communicating on

496
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,500
separate places because actors don't

497
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,570
have a direct access to the object they

498
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,159
only have an address so when they shoot

499
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,580
a message at the other actor you could

500
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,020
just take an async program and you could

501
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,309
have it running on one machine or you

502
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,870
could just flat it out across a whole

503
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,059
datacenter so I think that's kind of

504
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,490
cool so it has this action which it says

505
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,100
that it wants to read it and the body of

506
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,650
the message so in this case it was the

507
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,679
read thing so let's take a look at the

508
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,919
meta message which has the meta message

509
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,270
read things so this is how this one

510
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,669
actually works this is an actual handler

511
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:56,650
you see I set up this command handler

512
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,590
for the command read and the first

513
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,690
argument is an actor itself second

514
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,120
argument is the message and what it does

515
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,880
is it sends a message to whoever it got

516
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,409
it from which in this case would be the

517
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,049
player telling them this message and I

518
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,360
have this kind of terrible scribe ish S

519
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,980
XML ish

520
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
type system that I've called scrub 'l

521
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,990
and that name is as terrible as the

522
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,559
system is but but you can see it's doing

523
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,450
message-passing right here right so

524
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,770
that's pretty cool

525
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,059
but what other kind of message passing

526
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,040
is there so when you see this this kind

527
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,540
of message passing with this like you

528
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,799
know this arrow pointing in this

529
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,000
direction that's actually borrowed from

530
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,070
old message systems message passing

531
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,720
systems in Lisp which is what was

532
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,970
happened before generic methods became

533
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,500
popular as that message passing was

534
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,090
really popular and that a lot of people

535
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,500
were like Generic methods don't matter

536
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,850
anymore because we have we have I'm

537
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,020
surprised nobody's causing any

538
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,540
shenanigans but anyway you can also do

539
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,710
me to do stuff like it me dances anyway

540
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,460
so you can so you can what was I saying

541
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,490
so so you can send messages like this

542
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,960
and what happens is every time you do

543
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,429
one of these it actually suspends the

544
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,000
function and kind of shares work with

545
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,040
every other actor so it kind of has some

546
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,470
built-in cooperation but what's really

547
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,940
interesting is when you have these

548
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,000
things to have this with the arrow and

549
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,210
then wait so what that does is it shoots

550
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,740
off so this is an example of what I'm

551
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,290
taking from something and actually is

552
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,940
that something that proxies taking from

553
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,770
another object but I want to be able to

554
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,260
get what the actors like what type of

555
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,620
things that it went by right so normally

556
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,250
so this actually has a built-in like

557
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,380
automatic but also hidden behind the

558
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:50,590
scenes version of promises so what

559
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,390
happens is I'm sending a message and I'm

560
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,790
going to wait for its result to ask what

561
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,520
sort of names do you go by but instead

562
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,780
of having to split this into a whole

563
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,240
bunch of functions I actually just have

564
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,730
this one procedure that suspends when it

565
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,950
gets a message back it wakes back up

566
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,500
again and then it's able to extract the

567
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,929
value from it no need for call back

568
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,520
health is no need to split things up

569
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,230
into a bunch of things your programs

570
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,640
look as if you're writing just

571
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,290
completely straightforward scheme

572
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,179
programs no need to split it up into

573
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,890
like if you've done nodejs you know what

574
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,309
callback hell is it's not fun so that's

575
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:28,600
one nice thing about it so so yeah so

576
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,310
I think I've seen enough here you're

577
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,990
welcome to hang around or whatever but

578
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,930
I'm going south so oh we never read the

579
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,190
eight sync design goals I should

580
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,400
probably read that read eight sync

581
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,550
design goals okay yeah it's still

582
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,840
connected it's just making sure

583
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,850
oops read inside yeah okay that'll work

584
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,290
so it's an actor based shared-nothing

585
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,960
environment and what that means is actor

586
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,060
model is one way of being able to handle

587
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,150
concurrency so that things don't

588
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,220
basically if you've done any

589
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,660
asynchronous program you know how much

590
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,750
of a pain in the ass threads are right

591
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,140
and locking is a nightmare right and so

592
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,210
there's not what the actor model takes

593
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,800
as an approach is that each actor

594
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,540
manages its own state and they don't

595
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,230
share state between them so when I sip

596
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,830
the tea that decrements how many sips I

597
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,030
have left at a tea so if I go up go east

598
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,270
run machine this is I don't know why I

599
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,950
did one all the way up here just to show

600
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,290
this um yeah a simple example or suffice

601
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,940
but right when I'm sipping the tea you

602
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,250
know like I nothing's actually accessing

603
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,140
that tea number or interfering with it

604
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,810
I'm sending a message to request that

605
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,670
you know it decremented or something

606
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,050
like that but the actor itself is

607
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,360
handling that itself so you won't have

608
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,510
those kind of collisions so oh yeah I

609
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,100
forgot to reset the machine anyway

610
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:03,190
whatever I'm out of here down okay so

611
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,600
read sign so that's one thing another

612
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,820
thing is that it's live hackable so I

613
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,530
believe that concurrent systems are

614
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,350
really hard to write and the ideal

615
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,110
concurrent system development is where

616
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,330
you're able to evolve the system as it

617
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,000
runs this entire game I almost wrote the

618
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,830
entire thing while the program was

619
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,410
running so the whole like parsing system

620
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,670
and everything like that it just kind of

621
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,160
flowed out as the program developed and

622
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,020
it's really hard to plan concurrent

623
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,130
system so I think that this is really

624
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,710
important and also debugging concurrent

625
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,720
systems is wrong is really hard when I

626
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,060
fixed that issue I didn't have to

627
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,799
disconnect from the game

628
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,659
I could fix the game while it was

629
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,940
running even though you know there's a

630
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,769
bunch of things acting in it and for the

631
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:50,379
most part the actors don't like if one

632
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:53,529
actor breaks it might not be helping the

633
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:54,820
other actors that it's supposed to be

634
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,409
doing but it won't probably take down

635
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:57,999
the whole system at once there are other

636
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,559
components that still can't operate

637
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,749
without that actor can still operate

638
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:04,809
which i think is pretty nice call that

639
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:06,519
no callback hell I already talked about

640
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,409
that that's you know delimited

641
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:11,259
continuations blah blah blah so those

642
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,580
are the goals of eight sync and I think

643
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,499
that they've been carried off pretty

644
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:18,039
well so read map what should we do now

645
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,919
should we go to the async async' museum

646
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,639
or the Federation station opinions basic

647
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,789
museum okay go west so I go into a sync

648
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,710
Museum a security guard allows me to

649
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,970
pass through into the room then stands

650
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,799
in front of the door well wait why is

651
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,179
the security guard in front the door I'm

652
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,100
gonna go east again Oh security guard

653
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,450
tells me the only exit is through the

654
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,429
gift shop okay yeah I notice there's a

655
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:43,600
bunch of people in here did you guys get

656
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,909
stuck there is a way out if you see it

657
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,470
at the bottom there's a classic nethack

658
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,909
style store down here but uh anyway the

659
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,460
so there's a list of exhibits this is

660
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,470
kind of overwhelming yeah all the list

661
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,029
of exhibits that are right there so read

662
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:04,179
list 2016 progress that's probably a

663
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:06,039
good place to start right so let's look

664
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,399
at 2016 progress I told you guys this

665
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:10,960
was a wall of text and this is like the

666
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,759
worst wall of text of all right so you

667
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,440
can read this on your own time if you

668
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,960
want but uh oh man I can't believe like

669
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,720
I was like this this game like the game

670
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,509
content is like almost three thousand

671
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,950
lines long and that's not even including

672
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,509
the get engine that's just like the

673
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:27,129
thing that I'm running here so a little

674
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,109
bit too much content anyway so what's

675
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,869
happened over 2016 so at the towards the

676
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:35,850
end of 2016 at the beginning of 2016

677
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,080
there was some conversation about we

678
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,879
should have some sort of concurrent

679
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:42,419
programming environment for God right

680
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,419
mark Weaver David Thompson and Andrew

681
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:48,190
I'm gonna totally mispronounce his last

682
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,200
name

683
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,929
pseudo man on IRC all went to veggie

684
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:54,669
galaxy after they didn't

685
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,109
ACEF xxx party and we were talking about

686
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:59,200
what we could do and and then kind of

687
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,909
shortly after that I sent an email to

688
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,519
the list with kind of a brain dump and

689
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,169
then I think right around that time a

690
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,909
number of implementations started so I

691
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,169
started working on eight sync it

692
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:09,460
originally didn't include the actor

693
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,489
model itself but eventually moved to

694
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:13,929
mostly being around that actor model

695
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,299
Chris vine started guile ace async which

696
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,960
is also still an active project and and

697
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,909
then Andy Wingo came around and kind of

698
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,619
blew everything away out of the water by

699
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:29,109
Dom having us as he tends to do with

700
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,289
suspender warts so suspend aborts are

701
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,909
really cool so normally when you write

702
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,629
so I'm gonna show you some code let's

703
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:38,889
see here I'll gonna go to the eight sync

704
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:42,759
code code itself and go to the systems

705
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,519
and let's see the IRC code right so so

706
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,259
let's where would it be so this was

707
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:55,299
probably not the smartest idea and just

708
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:59,019
pull up code mid thing but okay so right

709
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:02,859
here yeah I should have definitely

710
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:05,049
bookmarked this before I started pulling

711
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:07,659
it up okay so I'm looping here but

712
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,119
what's this was probably not the

713
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,710
smartest choice I've made in this entire

714
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,649
talk but the what's the basic thing

715
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:15,940
behind suspend a ball courts is that

716
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,820
normally when you write code that needs

717
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,309
getting code out from some sort of

718
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,749
object so if you're running in a

719
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,850
blocking version of it you would just

720
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,179
say you know read from that port until

721
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,320
the stuff gets there and then the whole

722
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,720
program would feet freeze until some

723
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,269
code comes through that port right so

724
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:37,059
with the way that you usually do it and

725
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,679
the way that eight sync did it before I

726
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,080
switch to suspend double ports is that

727
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,450
you would actually take a port and then

728
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,980
you'd shove it over to the scheduler you

729
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,919
say call this callback when you get some

730
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,499
information right but the way that we do

731
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,960
it with since expendable ports is that

732
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,999
you actually start reading from the port

733
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:57,009
and then at the moment that it's going

734
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:58,539
to read from the port and it would block

735
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,850
it suspends to the scheduler and as soon

736
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,440
as and the rest of your program keeps

737
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,609
running and as soon as there's

738
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,200
information there it just continues so

739
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,730
you can just write a loop

740
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,220
exactly as if it would block but it just

741
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,440
magically doesn't when that's pretty

742
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,730
cool

743
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,690
so Andy put out fibers which I thought

744
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,010
which is a implementation of well I've

745
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,600
got a whole exhibit here on fibers so

746
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,630
maybe we should talk about that but but

747
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,309
that's basically kind of blew everything

748
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,669
out of the wallet there so look at lists

749
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,470
like I said wall of text talk but at

750
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,880
least we had the fun things with the

751
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,480
Machine and T beforehand so read ate

752
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,220
sink and fibers so this is oh look yeah

753
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,600
it's ink and fibers exhibit okay

754
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,669
so there are some similarities and

755
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:50,200
differences between h sync and fibers i

756
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,490
know a lot of people are like oh you

757
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,410
know what should i like what switch i be

758
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,000
following the most closely between all

759
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,280
of this so both of them are using

760
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,110
guileless stand double ports which is

761
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,490
not surprising and both of them use

762
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,419
message passing

763
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:04,059
so they actually look super similar like

764
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,130
they both have some sort of in boxy

765
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,480
looking thing that you're pulling stuff

766
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,840
out of and in fibers that's called a

767
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,549
channel which is kind of similar to I go

768
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,140
calls and etc and it eight think that's

769
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,669
called an inbox because each actor has

770
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:16,960
its own inbox now what made your

771
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,799
difference is that in fibers each

772
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,840
process might actually have two

773
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
different channels which actually means

774
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,169
you might end up in an accidental

775
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:27,880
situation where you have this

776
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,770
information coming on the second channel

777
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,200
and you start reading from the first one

778
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,640
and it never gets there something like

779
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,470
that so I actually think I have a slight

780
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,700
preference for the actor model because

781
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,320
you're only actually reading from one

782
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,510
that each actor is only reading from one

783
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,100
thing and it won't run into that problem

784
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,410
but they have both differents

785
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,850
theoretical basis one of them's based

786
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,640
off of communing fibers is based off of

787
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,080
the process calculi specifically CSP but

788
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,850
you create read up on if you want and

789
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,620
each think is based on the actor model

790
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,690
and if you're a Matthew person I might

791
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,760
tell you hey they're dual and you'll be

792
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
like that's cool and if you're not an

793
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,280
athlete person it doesn't matter

794
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,760
so let's let's look at the list what

795
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,780
else have we got here well we already

796
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,100
talked about suspended before so I

797
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,809
talked about that

798
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:14,809
I actually think that we've talked about

799
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,340
most of it oh yeah I was conceived by

800
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,420
Karl cuit shared-nothing oh yeah this is

801
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,770
kind of interesting it was originally

802
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,360
the research goal of scheme so this

803
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,370
actually has brings us back to schemes

804
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,980
roots scheme was originally created when

805
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,500
Gerald Sussman and guile Steele were

806
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,179
trying to explore the actor model and

807
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,520
then they discovered they also tried to

808
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,860
build in this version of the lambda

809
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,090
calculus alongside it and then they

810
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,490
suddenly realized that the the whole the

811
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,929
way they passed in the arguments and the

812
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,429
way that they got things back were

813
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,870
actually exactly the same and they're

814
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,850
like these are the same thing now

815
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,679
they're turns out they're not exactly

816
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,660
the same thing but it's pretty close but

817
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,980
one of the major differences with the

818
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,470
actor model is that you don't actually

819
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,540
have direct access to whatever you're

820
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,090
calling you it's at it might not be in

821
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,710
the same address space which I think

822
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,990
usually in most even though I'm not sure

823
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,760
the lambda calculus expects that this

824
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,140
whole idea that you're sending a

825
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,090
possibly serialized malleable message

826
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,809
somewhere else and that you might even

827
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,790
get back like an error result or it

828
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,290
might never end up finishing or stuff

829
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,000
like that it has a different set of

830
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,640
expectations than you know then just

831
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,679
like you know vanilla ski and just

832
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,530
calling things and stuff like that so

833
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,120
and pretty much all distributed systems

834
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,350
can be viewed as in terms of the actor

835
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,850
model think about what servers right

836
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,500
you've got a web server you send a

837
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,179
request to it that's sending a message

838
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,250
and it passes a request response back

839
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,549
right pretty much all systems can be

840
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,720
viewed in the actor models that are

841
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,710
concurrent so I'm gonna go south into

842
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,960
the gift shop which I never finished and

843
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,370
I forgot to even commit the thing that

844
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,799
said that it wasn't finished

845
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,299
there you go north west north east

846
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,760
because that's embarrassing okay so I

847
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,630
exited the gift shop so let's see here

848
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,309
well we're getting do this a lot faster

849
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,669
than I expected so we still have the

850
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,270
Federation station should we go there

851
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,270
okay let's go there so this is actually

852
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,629
the whole basis of me working on on all

853
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:13,790
this stuff in the first place is because

854
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,600
I wanted to build in I'm working some of

855
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,340
you know maybe not everybody my main

856
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,168
thing is I'm working on trying to do

857
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,300
decentralized internet things right and

858
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,609
I get so frustrated with coding and

859
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:27,440
every other thing that's trying to do

860
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,840
concurrent programming that you know I I

861
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,440
decided to shave all the acts and head

862
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,989
over to guy luckily we go and I are

863
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,760
shaving some in parallel so we're kind

864
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,469
of like building off of each other maybe

865
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:43,909
but you know so this so what I one of

866
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,020
the things I work on is something called

867
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,929
Activity pub which this guy's a familiar

868
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,780
with at least he works on pump IO but

869
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,070
I'm activity pub is a implementation of

870
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,050
it's a standard from the w3c in fact we

871
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,200
have a poster here so read poster

872
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,210
it even has links that you can click

873
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,660
what mod has links right but anyway so

874
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,830
I'm working with the social working

875
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,010
group that has that and it's so it uses

876
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,290
a pretty simple JSON LG in fact I might

877
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,359
as well pull up the spec activity pub

878
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,660
why not so this is oh the network went

879
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,100
down Oh probably none of you are doing

880
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,240
anything because the network

881
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,260
disconnected huh

882
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,090
that's why nothing's happening I was

883
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,380
like man you guys just all went quiet no

884
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,990
it was just it was see this is what

885
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,460
happens when you have a wireless card

886
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,790
that's like ancient that's connecting to

887
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,609
you know a conference Wi-Fi and then

888
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,200
you're doing everything over an SSH

889
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,570
tunnel on your VPN probably not

890
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,369
everything is going to hold up right so

891
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:45,380
anyway okay we're back up and running

892
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,910
you'll have to refresh if you actually

893
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,050
want to rejoin the game but I don't

894
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,790
blame me if you're like screw that I

895
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,530
lost all my experience points right I

896
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,210
got so

897
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,010
Bera no experience for us there was

898
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,480
originally gonna be a frogman you could

899
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,890
punch but I never got it in the that so

900
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,500
anyway so activities activity prods

901
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,130
pretty simple the whole idea is that

902
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,329
every every user has a an inbox in an

903
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,369
out box and you when you are doing

904
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,760
Federation if you you Federation happens

905
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,039
so say I post a video to my media goblin

906
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,049
instance and you and Ludovic wants to

907
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,510
see this video right so Ludovic is

908
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,450
subscribed to me so my server posts that

909
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,700
serialization of like the metadata about

910
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,250
the video to Ludovic server and it's

911
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,410
just a simple JSON format a fairly

912
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,510
extensible one but still a JSON format

913
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,279
so it goes over to Ludovic server and

914
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,900
and it might look like this so this is

915
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,520
an example of an object

916
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,170
this person's liking a note called I'm a

917
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,809
goat and and so like so but Ludovic gets

918
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,339
the thing and then whatever social

919
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,559
networking application he has he can see

920
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,720
my video right and he can comment on it

921
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,940
make comments on my video and it has you

922
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,460
know kind of email like addressing with

923
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,109
two CC and BCC and so and and that's

924
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,700
that's how the whole thing works is

925
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,470
actually and now wait a minute

926
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,359
this looks this sounds kind of familiar

927
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:17,920
doesn't it wait a minute so we've got

928
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,549
we're playing a game where we're using

929
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:24,740
the actor model to send messages between

930
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,529
things and we've got this kind of

931
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:29,779
subject predicate object structure right

932
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:33,890
like take duck from box right well

933
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,369
that's not too different from like post

934
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,710
blah blah blah they're both subject

935
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,000
predicate object systems

936
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,279
and so wait a minute I've got this chart

937
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:47,059
here so there's this chart that's in

938
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,099
this room that's like conspiracy

939
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,349
theorist it's all related it shouts the

940
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,980
over-exuberant conspiracy sorry

941
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,390
Federation actor/model

942
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,260
scheme Adventures months what do these

943
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,549
have in common everything right so so so

944
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,950
and they've got like this poster has

945
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,990
like circles and wines drawn along it

946
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,950
and like red

947
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,260
and stuff like that so scheme was

948
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,549
originally started to explore the lacked

949
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:16,280
or model as I said and there's a really

950
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,589
interesting paper by Sussman and steel

951
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,960
that's exploring the first report on

952
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
skiing that I really recommend that you

953
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,859
check out the activity pub for a

954
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,380
protocol is using Federation via the

955
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,809
activity streams format and text

956
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,880
adventures and muds follow similar you

957
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,680
know structure to break down commands of

958
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,299
players Federation in the actor model

959
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:36,799
they're both based on a highly

960
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,210
concurrent systems that use message

961
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:38,809
passing

962
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,390
Zork the first adventure text adventure

963
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,839
used muddle which is actually a ancestor

964
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,369
of scheme so actually uses a very scheme

965
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,230
like language to program the like the

966
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,299
first major text adventure because zerk

967
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:56,390
came out of MIT during that same era and

968
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,760
so in the 1990s before the web became

969
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,839
get big is a hilarious link yeah let's

970
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:06,740
look at all these frames here is a

971
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,200
document cuz muds actually were a big

972
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,299
research subject like like there was a

973
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,010
famous mud called lambda mu that ran out

974
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,890
of the ran out of it was either Xerox

975
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,109
PARC or Palo Alto Research Center it was

976
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,910
the same thing I never remember but

977
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,790
anyway the that like and so they were

978
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,950
late they were a big idea and language

979
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,329
design and people fought like muds are

980
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,190
the future like that's how everybody's

981
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,450
gonna communicate on the Internet is

982
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,520
this like cyberpunk vision of things

983
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,799
we're like walking around worlds and

984
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,569
like interacting with things and stuff

985
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:37,099
like that well instead we just read web

986
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,059
pages but you know so the but this but

987
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,490
here's a document that's like hey muds

988
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,990
are so cool we're making a lot of

989
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,680
progress

990
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,220
why don't we Feder a 10 well gee golly

991
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,859
like people wrote this thing up and then

992
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,599
like only way later do we end up trying

993
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,520
to do this stuff and like the web right

994
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,900
of course they didn't make any more

995
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,160
progress than like well we're making

996
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,099
more progress in them so whatever but

997
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,569
anyway but I would I find really

998
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,400
interesting is a lot of these the ideas

999
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,450
are circular and inked and

1000
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,339
interconnected right like text

1001
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,890
adventures relating to like the work I

1002
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,510
do on Federation who would have fought

1003
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,809
right super fun okay

1004
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,369
so we're getting to the point where I

1005
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:18,260
should probably either ask questions or

1006
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,700
I could just do Arnie's talk and then do

1007
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,839
questions I don't know what do you

1008
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:22,890
thinks the best version

1009
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:27,029
yeah yeah okay so why don't we do

1010
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,279
questions first who has any questions oh

1011
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:30,989
it's true kiri entered the room you can

1012
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:33,029
I give strew ghee if you want you can

1013
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:35,279
ask a question via the Gibeah the game

1014
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,679
it's totally fine

1015
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:47,929
stops Turkey nope did not go through

1016
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,690
Oh stupid connection I bet I

1017
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:00,810
disconnected there's no tinfoil hat but

1018
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,480
we could program one live do you want to

1019
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,310
see answer we added a thing to the game

1020
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,570
live why not

1021
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,360
Jen foil hat okay let's add it to the

1022
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,280
the gate of the playroom and I got a

1023
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,640
switch back to Bricker back so tit

1024
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,310
playroom so let's see here so here's

1025
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,160
where I've got all the RGB stuff with

1026
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,540
the the whole machine and inside oh yeah

1027
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,160
there's a rubber duck inside of here

1028
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,540
well why don't we instead of how the

1029
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,660
double duck will add you know tinfoil

1030
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,859
hat right so we're gonna say it's a

1031
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:46,440
tinfoil hat goes by tinfoil hat and also

1032
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,540
just hat you can take it you'd have to

1033
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:58,110
be a crazy person to wear this thing and

1034
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,230
I'm gonna and I'm gonna inject it right

1035
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:08,520
into the game tinfoil hat okay what oh

1036
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,470
yeah so I can give it a wear hey man so

1037
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,090
actually why don't we do that first so

1038
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,470
that's going to require that I subclass

1039
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,370
it but well we'll do it so I'm gonna I'm

1040
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,600
gonna take something else that already

1041
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,520
has been kind of defined and just lunge

1042
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,500
it let's see here define actor something

1043
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,040
with commands okay good enough this is a

1044
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,930
hot tea one so I'm gonna abuse a hot tea

1045
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,270
thing and I'm gonna make a tinfoil hat

1046
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,890
tinfoil hat gay mobs

1047
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:42,480
command wear tinfoil hat wear and we're

1048
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,660
not gonna sip the Hat build the commands

1049
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,690
we're which is a direct command to

1050
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,380
command where now this is a mud sink

1051
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,330
specific thing with this command command

1052
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,830
see right you guys are looking at

1053
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,990
abstraction piled on abstraction piled

1054
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,690
on abstraction here so

1055
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,369
I don't need those because those are

1056
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:03,930
already defined in the other thing so

1057
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:10,349
now I need to define command tinfoil hat

1058
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:15,539
wear in foil hat message we don't really

1059
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,220
care about anything else we're just

1060
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,849
gonna say and we're just going to do

1061
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,240
this super fast so message from message

1062
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,730
we're going to tell them text you put on

1063
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,680
the tinfoil and foil hat and to be

1064
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,910
perfectly honest with you honest with

1065
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:44,720
you I'm gonna do that

1066
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,589
it's a lot harder to take you seriously

1067
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:54,329
okay so we've got a tinfoil hat

1068
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:57,569
unspecified on yeah well I evaluated it

1069
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,339
now so should we find so now I'm gonna

1070
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,950
go down to the tinfoil hat switch it

1071
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,270
over to be a tinfoil hat let's see I'm

1072
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,339
gonna inject it straight into the game

1073
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:12,930
let's see here look okay West so I'm

1074

seriously

1083
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,860
all right I don't think we have time for

1084
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,080
any more equipment we should switch but

1085
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,180
I'm about to do Arnie's presentation for

1086
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,319
him it'll be super fast
