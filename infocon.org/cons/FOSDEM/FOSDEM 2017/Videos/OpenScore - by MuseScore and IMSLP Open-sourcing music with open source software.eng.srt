1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,740
welcome everybody please give a warm

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,840
welcome to mr. Peter Jonas who's going

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,720
to tell us about doping score

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:20,269
[Applause]

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,850
okay everyone so I'm going to talk about

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,040
open Scott which is a collaborative

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,970
project between musescore and imslp and

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,270
we want to open source music using open

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,239
source software what do we mean by open

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,160
source music well we want to liberate

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,010
the music from copyright restrictions so

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,180
everyone can do what they want with it

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,489
and we also want to liberate it from

14
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,640
paper we want digital music you

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,019
basically if you think of what

16
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,900
OpenStreetMap did for maps and project

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,120
gutenberg did for books we want to do

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,800
the same for sheet music so how would

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,420
you go about doing that well it's a

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,250
two-step process you start from the

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,399
original score and then you have to get

22
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,420
it you have to get it onto a computer

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,270
somehow so we need to scan it and

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,000
convert it into a bitmap image but it

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,440
doesn't end there because the next step

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,270
is we want to turn it into a semantic

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,000
score something that we can play an

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,500
extract data from and the end result is

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,200
that we'll get the actual musical source

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,619
code in an XML format which is editable

31
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,840
and possible and then we're going to

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,030
release it and a Creative Commons

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,159
license so everyone is able to do

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,630
whatever they want with it and so this

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,720
would allow you to listen to music edit

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,070
it and share it and I've got a quick

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,740
demo of that so here we have some sheet

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,450
music within music score which is a open

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,659
source music notation editor so you can

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,960
listen to the music and you can edit it

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,110
and then you can share it with the world

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,110
in a variety of different formats so

43
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,360
yeah so that's so the the sheet music is

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
very much a living Beast once you get it

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,350
onto the computer so to cover step one

46
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,810
getting it in scanning the music where

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,010
this is where we're partnering with

48
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,840
imslp so they have there's a vast

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,200
community of users who are uploading

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,550
scanned copies of sheet music that they

51
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,140
find around the world in libraries and

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,970
private collections so this is old

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,390
editions that are no longer in copyright

54
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,400
so this is the sort of thing you'd

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,239
expect if you on imslp so we have

56
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,150
Tchaikovsky's six symphony here so you

57
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,379
can see all the variety of different

58
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,140
formats it's available to download in

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,050
but what you get out of this is a PDF

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,550
file so just a series of pictures of

61
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,959
pages so it's quite static it's not it's

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,340
not living like the the XML music is so

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,730
then the next step is musescore and this

64
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,860
is where musicals community comes in so

65
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,530
musescore is an open source music

66
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,069
notation program and GPL version 2 but

67
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,659
it's also a community of sheet music

68
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,050
creators who use the software to create

69
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,230
their own original compositions or to

70
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,709
transcribe existing pieces and then they

71
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,510
upload that to music or to come and

72
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,709
share it with the world so starting from

73
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,819
this bitmap score the PDF file this is

74
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,769
how you'd go about entering the notes

75
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,670
into musical so it's a very long and

76
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,950
tedious process for one person to do it

77
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,250
on their own but by outsourcing it to a

78
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,340
bunch of do to many individuals we can

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,540
go from just a few notes to a whole

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,400
score and you see what we've done here

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,190
is we've added a nice cover to it for

82
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,030
the the open score Edition

83
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,009
[Music]

84
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,769
so this is that Tchaikovsky that I

85
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,660
showed you a minute ago in the the PDF

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,779
file that's been added

87
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,750
typed up by new scores users and we sent

88
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,580
this out to a whole bunch of them we

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,850
gave them two pages to do each and after

90
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,850
a week we got back this whole symphony

91
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,850
and once you've got it in to musescore

92
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,650
and you have this XML you can then

93
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,600
output it in a variety of different

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,880
formats so you could see them here so

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,130
there's the main music XML for sharing

96
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,350
with other notations software but then

97
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,729
of course you can output in a number of

98
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,000
different image audio and video formats

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
as well and then because we release

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
under a Creative Commons license it

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,850
gives you the freedom to do whatever you

102
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,430
want with the file as long as you credit

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,410
that you got it from open score so how

104
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,669
are we how is this going to happen so we

105
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,280
really want to kickstart this and to

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,830
incentivize music's users to get out

107
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,199
there and start transcribing these

108
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,550
pieces to get them into the digital

109
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,349
formats and the way that we're going to

110
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,539
do that is we're going to incentivize

111
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,030
them with free membership of the music

112
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,770
or comm website which allows them to

113
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,800
share as many scores as they like and in

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,599
order to to fund this and provide these

115
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,340
rewards and incentives we'll be running

116
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,599
a Kickstarter and so the money from the

117
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:44,479
Kickstarter will go towards

118
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,720
incentivizing the crowdsourcing effort

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,190
so what will happen with the Kickstarter

120
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,010
is that the backers will select the

121
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,880
pieces to transcribe and then we will

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,320
hand them out to musicals users to

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,080
produce the transcriptions and then we

124
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,669
will check those transcriptions to make

125
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,060
sure that they match the originals and

126
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,990
and provide an exact semantic copy of

127
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,599
the original music so if you say if you

128
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,340
go onto the musical comm and you're

129
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,789
looking for the Beethoven's 5th Symphony

130
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,620
then you'll know that that's exactly

131
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,419
what you're getting there's no no

132
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,740
edits no you're getting the exact

133
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,840
original and there's a whole number of

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,629
different use cases that we envision

135
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,099
that people will want to use these

136
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,389
scores for and we're partnering with

137
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,639
these other organizations to make these

138
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,879
happen so you can see some of them there

139
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,810
and I'll talk about some of these

140
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,840
different use cases so the number one is

141
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,030
accessibility so you can see so if

142
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,680
somebody's partially sighted and they're

143
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,300
trying to read sheet music then at the

144
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,819
moment there's you they have to use some

145
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,189
kind of magnification technique but we

146
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,210
can do better than that

147
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,050
so once you have the semantic score you

148
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,509
are able to to enlarge it to change the

149
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,210
fonts and make something called modified

150
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,930
stave notation or you can color

151
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,330
different notes for people with reading

152
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,500
disabilities like dyslexia and we can

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,479
even output Braille as well for blind

154
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,919
musicians and of course once you have

155
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,020
the digital file you're able to enjoy

156
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,789
the music on a range of different

157
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,860
devices and publish it on various

158
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,639
different platforms

159
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,150
so one of the more interesting uses

160
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,970
that's happening at the moment is some

161
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,140
students at the university of san

162
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,460
andrews are using mousse court who

163
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,470
produce translations of French operas

164
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,760
they're translating them into English

165
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,560
and when you have the digital file in

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,210
musescore it allows you to write the

167
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,980
trans alaric translation straight

168
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,430
underneath the original language and

169
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,360
then the students can share their

170
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,320
translations with each other they don't

171
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,750
have to worry about copyright issues

172
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,940
from photocopying music that kind of

173
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,630
thing or you can use these files as a

174
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,580
research tools so if you pair it with

175
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,490
the open source music 21 toolkit then

176
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,950
you can extract information from the

177
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,110
scores sort of how many notes of each

178
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,360
different kind are there or what key

179
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,150
signatures did the composer use and then

180
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,159
thanks to the Creative Commons license

181
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,440
researchers can publish their results

182
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,050
and any license of their choosing and

183
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,990
once we have these digital scores we'll

184
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,480
be able to feed them into artificial

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,820
intelligence machine learning algorithms

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,840
to try and teach computers how to create

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,600
music so you might have heard of these

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,380
projects where they teach the computer

189
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,250
how back would the sort of box style of

190
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,200
composition and then the computer can

191
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,850
output another piece that was not made

192
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,420
from any of Bark's pieces but is in box

193
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,060
style so machine learning that kind of

194
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,030
thing and the other thing you can do is

195
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,110
you can create these artistic

196
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,210
visualizations from the sheet music so

197
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,550
this is made by another of our partners

198
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,380
and this is a visualization of the Four

199
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,290
Seasons and if you start at the top and

200
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,790
you read it clockwise that tells you the

201
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,610
where you are within the piece and the

202
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,950
each dot represents a note in the score

203
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,900
the size of the dot is the volume and

204
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,170
its distance from the the center of the

205
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,880
circle is its pitch so that's a visual

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,060
representation of a score and the colors

207
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,600
tells you which instruments we use

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,949
so there's various other uses as well

209
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:01,660
like video games so you can imagine sort

210
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,360
of playing along with a score or remix

211
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,029
in the content and one of the the

212
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,049
ultimate goal is to have to be able to

213
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,730
give the most enriched experience with

214
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,679
the music as possible so to use the the

215
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,429
music that the sheet music to to enrich

216
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:30,939
other media such as videos that kind of

217
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,639
thing so I have a demonstration of that

218
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,920
over here so this is Beethoven's fifth

219
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,100
symphony that has we've made an open

220
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,160
score Edition so you can see we've given

221
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,529
it a cover page made by the the visual

222
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:50,920
artist and then we've synchronized this

223
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,350
with a YouTube video using open source

224
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,529
software

225
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:17,980
[Music]

226
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,420
so if you have the curious as to what

227
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,470
Beethoven's 5th Symphony actually looks

228
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,710
like then now you know

229
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,419
[Music]

230
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,590
so now that's the presentation so now

231
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:47,240
we'll take questions thank you so thank

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,550
you very much if there are any questions

233
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,260
please raise your hand I'll get the mic

234
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,560
to you

235
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,329
how soon will you be accepting

236
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,269
volunteers from you scorch transcript

237
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,839
for open skort transcribing so we're

238
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,990
currently running a pilot project to

239
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,290
transcribe the Tchaikovsky piece and

240
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,060
we've just put out a notice on the

241
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,040
musical websites so you'll be able to

242
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,350
sign up using this link to register your

243
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,350
interest and we should be ready to start

244
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,440
going within a month or so yeah

245
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,940
concerning compatibility you've

246
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,699
mentioned music XML but did not mention

247
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,709
the music and coding initiative for

248
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,410
example is there a reason for that the

249
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,510
music encoding initiative initiative yet

250
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:48,180
it's another standard for XML but we're

251
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,490
going for open as many formats as

252
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,230
possible and there's assuming that your

253
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,810
user codes can import music XML then it

254
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,970
will be compatible with that but we can

255
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,829
export MIDI and a whole variety of

256
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,459
different formats

257
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,370
I have two related questions first of

258
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,930
all your your licensing under general

259
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,600
Creative Commons what was the rationale

260
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,209
behind not either asking frack for

261
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,240
attribution which to many composers

262
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,040
would be important they have to give it

263
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,329
away but they would like to know that

264
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,199
they composed it and secondly share

265
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,389
alike to ensure other people behave in

266
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,029
the same way and then relates that if

267
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,560
you describe what seemed a very

268
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,899
centralized process what if someone

269
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,519
comes up and says I've actually happened

270
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,050
to have done a complete transcription of

271
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,060
some piece of music are you set up to

272
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,329
take contributions even if they weren't

273
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,180
the ones you originally asked for yes so

274
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,819
we will where we find existing

275
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,769
compositions that are either and a

276
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,600
compatible license or the person is

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,329
willing to license them to us under a

278
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,519
suitable license then we are happy to

279
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,740
use those

280
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,160
and why did we choose the Creative

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,020
Commons Attribution license rather than

282
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,640
share-alike where we we wanted to be as

283
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,240
open as possible I guess is the reason

284
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,880
to that and it's something that we are

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,790
still considering but we basically

286
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,040
wanted it to be as open as possible so

287
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,140
the the file you can already get the PDF

288
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,770
files are already available and

289
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,840
completely open licenses and we don't

290
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,660
want to restrict other people artists

291
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,380
and so on from monetizing the things

292
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:54,540
that they create using open Scott are

293
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,040
you building tools for melody

294
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,020
recognition tool now you have all those

295
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,890
source pass I for image recognition was

296
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,020
that melody recognition melody

297
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,010
recognition yes

298
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,120
so you heard of the music 21 toolkit

299
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,780
that does you can extract various

300
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,820
information using that I'm not sure if

301
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,300
it's familiar with melody recognition

302
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,680
there is that also there is the the tool

303
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,040
that we use to synchronize the the

304
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,190
scores with the videos that does it

305
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,430
matches the the two different sound

306
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,560
sources together yeah so I think this is

307
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,030
time for one more question anybody

308
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,459
is this typing in of music or not a lot

309
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,589
of work isn't it easier to do something

310
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,279
like OCR or something okay so there are

311
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,740
tools that can do an automatic

312
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,870
conversion but they're currently not

313
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,940
reliable enough at least not the

314
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,800
open-source ones so we want to we're

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,860
going to type this in manually but what

316
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,769
that will do is it will give us a set of

317
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,560
PDFs and the matching XML scores and

318
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
then we can use that to Train artificial

319
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,940
intelligence to make the Cata Matic

320
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,829
conversion process more reliable in the

321
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,270
future so thank you very much thank you

322
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:30,039
[Applause]
