1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,900
exclusively on bail

2
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,489
okay well hi everyone we are Christoph

3
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,320
which is a maintainer of cosy

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,540
application and I'm women I work for

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,110
Prezi and you have here what github and

6
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,730
Twitter understand if you want to find

7
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,280
us there so who doesn't know anything

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,030
about cozy ok so I'm going to start

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,550
first what see tears and then let me

10
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,960
explain or talk tomorrow still chilling

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,729
so you'll see address it's considered

12
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,979
i/o it's an open source personal cloud

13
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,590
platform what do we mean our platform

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,740
that's aim for us is to have some basic

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,700
application pre-install so contacts

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,570
calendar files but more importantly the

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,039
fact that developer can develop

18
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,660
application for its install more

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,700
application and make more application

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,270
and currently it's a better software and

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,770
today we are going to argue about the

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,860
fact that the web should actually be

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,689
more centralized sorry Annie but the

24
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,509
idea that's today you have your data are

25
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:50,180
everywhere so some of your data by

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,579
Facebook Sandra at Google now maybe for

27
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,729
everyone here but most people are like

28
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:55,969
that

29
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,829
and so we argue that we should bring

30
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,540
before we can use it we should bring our

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,960
data back in one place all the data one

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,419
person should be in one person computer

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:15,320
and one for some cloud computer so step

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,390
one you want you you you want your data

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,970
back in your cozy cloud server your own

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,810
server which is yours if you want to do

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,850
that there is already an app an

38
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,070
application which is which you can

39
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,829
install on your secured server which is

40
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,920
made for that so I will show it to you

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,239
first okay here is a cozy server the web

42
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,040
interface you have the my account

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,400
application with a list here with all

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
the what what we call connectors to

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,670
many many different type of data you

46
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,909
have you have you can get your bills

47
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,939
from different service services you can

48
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,310
get your bank accounts you can get your

49
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,549
podcast you can get whatever you your

50
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:11,819
Facebook events I don't know and some of

51
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,709
those things

52
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:21,030
also your else data say so but yeah I

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,970
supposed to know there are 50 connectors

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,400
that says okay but there are many many

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,870
more services so you have a problem you

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,480
have you don't have your you don't have

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,170
your you not have your data you use a

58
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,790
connector for your data doesn't exist

59
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:48,329
what can you do okay so you can do

60
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,579
something the only skill you need to

61
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,700
have is a little bit of JavaScript so no

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,699
not you not need to know all about

63
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,739
JavaScript but little bit of JavaScript

64
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,139
a little bit of jQuery and you can do

65
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,849
something all you have to do is write a

66
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,090
single javascript file and the my

67
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,280
account application already does the

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,380
boring stuff file so it can the my

69
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,798
account application can ask for you to

70
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,168
the user

71
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,169
your login so if I show it to you when I

72
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,580
confirm whoops

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,150
it can ask your email your password and

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,610
you don't want to develop for each

75
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,219
connector a web interface to ask those

76
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,370
kind of things so the my account helps

77
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,650
you to do that you just have to declare

78
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,050
just have to declare in your JavaScript

79
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,430
file the list of fields you need and you

80
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,979
declare the name of the connector even

81
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,949
trigger a link and end the different

82
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:11,259
data so if you want to write your

83
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,819
connector imagine the target of your

84
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,129
connector offers you an API then you're

85
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,069
lucky because it's quite rare that the

86
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,330
web services allow you to get that data

87
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,259
at the moment it's approximately 5% of

88
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,330
the connector which use an API so if

89
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,759
you're not lucky you will have to do web

90
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,759
scraping so web scraping is simulating a

91
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,440
web browser and and try to pick the data

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,979
that interests you for that you have

93
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,589
some NPM some NPM packages which are

94
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,190
JavaScript packages to help you you have

95
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,610
requests requests for Mizer which will

96
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,979
help you to get data from the web in the

97
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,199
form of an HTML page page and so cheo

98
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,710
cheo package which will pass the HTML

99
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,379
page and let you with some jQuery

100
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,469
selectors select user data you're

101
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:31,110
interested in so that was an example of

102
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,469
a connector it's just a small part

103
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,659
because I couldn't show all the guard

104
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:42,009
but that's a part which logins which

105
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,880
login to the the web services and the

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,559
displacer the data you are

107
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,899
but you have after to pass it and get

108
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,789
your data so here you you request it's

109
00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:00,099
an example for Huber actually it it's

110
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,369
displays the login page you get it as

111
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:07,509
the body you get an HTML string you pass

112
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,599
it with Jo and this allows you to get

113
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,359
the token which will be used by Weber to

114
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:18,359
authenticate your your your request

115
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:23,159
after that you can do another request to

116
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,069
to then display the page that interest

117
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,489
you which in this case displays all the

118
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:33,309
list of you Barbies that you want to

119
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:40,299
check and and that's all after that okay

120
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:48,279
you can do you you can get your data so

121
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,889
once you have your data back into your

122
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,699
own server second questions is what do I

123
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,849
do with it now because okay it's cool I

124
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,129
got all my bills back into my file

125
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:04,389
system I got the events into my calendar

126
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,539
from Facebook I got some information

127
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,099
MIT's supreme is that you when we can do

128
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,229
more we can not only just retrieve all

129
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,879
the data from the user but owns all the

130
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,159
data of an uzi are the same place are

131
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,399
summarized into the users own personal

132
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,769
cloud we can make an app to use them to

133
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,049
now that's also tell you if you can

134
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,179
access them as easily without having to

135
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,360
use complicated oils with every services

136
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,259
for even solicited proposals we can

137
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,969
bring you ballot in a single place and

138
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,688
do simple application so cause the

139
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,410
application our webpage very simple I'm

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,829
going to build very fast so you have a

141
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,529
HTML pages you have a package for JSON

142
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,589
with some explanation most importantly

143
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,720
in this which is a manifest of the

144
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,980
application

145
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,749
most important things the manifest of an

146
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,609
application is super mission which means

147
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,589
to get back control of your data it

148
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,809
means when you install an application on

149
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,609
your cousin the same that were in

150
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,040
straight and smartphone the application

151
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,949
need to ask for permission which isn't

152
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,540
better than the agency will be that

153
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,329
anything I put on my computer with the

154
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,970
Linux computer unless you do very strict

155
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,290
XE your control permission the

156
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,480
application can access every file and

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,649
she's not what you want you wanted to

158
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,019
access only what it needs to work

159
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,879
Cemil important so quickly we can so

160
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,949
this is a chilled repudiation which

161
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,470
which we've also to do if you show them

162
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,509
but more interestingly is that now that

163
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,149
we've brought back the users data so in

164
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,369
this case bill we brought back from uber

165
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,699
or from twenty nine we can other

166
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,790
children too well

167
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,040
this invoice we launched we want to

168
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,869
invite it to a company we want to send

169
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:11,079
it we want to pay it ransom and so we

170
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,989
can very easily access the data we just

171
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,999
brought back from connector and use it

172
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:21,399
in our current application and so the

173
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,009
previous function was bringing back the

174
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,089
bill we just brought back from

175
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,959
connectors we want you we fetch it and

176
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,089
then we use it to create a children for

177
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,389
instance

178
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,490
okay and so for instance in a 2d

179
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,600
application we get back we can create

180
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,190
attitudes who pass the last beer we

181
00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:00,920
receive from from connector so so in

182
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,220
conclusion you can help us to develop

183
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,810
new new connectors so if you don't know

184
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,230
a lot of the cosy infrastructure you can

185
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,569
even just write a single javascript file

186
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,569
which gets the data and output it in the

187
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,610
console and you can come and come to us

188
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,670
too in the forum where you are you have

189
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,300
the address to end we can up you to

190
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,420
finish your connectors so there's a lot

191
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,209
of people to to help you for that in

192
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:38,060
French and in English so and and you can

193
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,459
also of course if you have a little bit

194
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,959
more skills that you can even develop

195
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,370
your own application which is as you saw

196
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,939
only a single just just a single statute

197
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,509
application so I'll pass we need your

198
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:55,660
help

199
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:23,490
I don't think it exists yet yes

200
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,190
is there a selfish version of the cozy

201
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,530
application no not yet at the moment is

202
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:37,110
is it's on Ubuntu I should state I'm not

203
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:44,880
a developer this kind of things so for

204
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,370
now we have Debian package and we are

205
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,960
becoming contribution to make more

206
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,810
package with the need to maintain them

207
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:08,430
afterward yes ok so a question is where

208
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,660
is the data stored so cozy is based on

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,120
cardi B so in the current version of

210
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,440
cozy also that is put in cardi B and in

211
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,540
the version which in the next option we

212
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,300
are putting back the file system parts

213
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,750
on the file system actually so we can

214
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,830
access the file so it's wherever you

215
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,480
want because is the open source software

216
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,090
so you can install it on a Raspberry Pi

217
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,150
at home or if you trust some most thing

218
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,840
company you can put it there and you can

219
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,520
move it if they need a rise of the

220
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,199
question yes

221
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,560
now it's a Debian package which is on

222
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:23,550
PPA we're not even see yes Conan so we

223
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,700
we have tried and because it's based on

224
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,490
Cordova's web the mobile application is

225
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,149
based on Cordova and we had some issue

226
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,300
with a full build on after all we love

227
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,490
to ask the mobile developer but that was

228
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,860
the issue we had but we will like we

229
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,140
would love to to put it on a train come

230
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,230
again

231
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,970
yes the cook is their extensive

232
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,800
permission for cozy for cuisine CID is

233
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
that every application defines the

234
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
permission it needs for what needed to

235
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,290
access the files the contacts occur and

236
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,810
are asan and and the cozy platform

237
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,860
unforce this permission so the

238
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,750
application can only access what it does

239
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:38,769
the right to access yes for the is

240
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,529
encryption sorry yeah the question is

241
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,690
that's password for the accounts are

242
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,240
there encryption so the password is

243
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,930
encrypted on disk but it's a fact that's

244
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,480
just crap from a result websites we need

245
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
to decrypt it's in run so when you log

246
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,889
in to your cozy keys in red sheet from

247
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,440
your past form from your cozy password

248
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,930
which are all decrypting while you're

249
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,579
crazy is on if you turn off the

250
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,949
Raspberry Pi it stay cryptid on disk

251
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,750
okay so the question is out you use that

252
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,180
uh from custom car keys how to use data

253
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,399
from quasi firming up outside of cozy so

254
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,459
in the next version of cozy we have OSAP

255
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,230
I to Oz flow which are all external

256
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,230
application to request access to data of

257
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,390
the cosy so send and when you install an

258
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,940
application inside your cozy which the

259
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,769
same permission set and ask for

260
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,299
permission and so you can either use

261
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,369
this API to bring that out to your wiki

262
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,309
application or you can do this away

263
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,839
depending on what kind of interaction

264
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,669
you want to do you can bring that are

265
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,559
familiar with ETA cozy and put an app

266
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,390
inside a cozy it depends on your skis

267
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:25,470
really yes

268
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,149
reservation was how many connectors do

269
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:35,269
we have we have 50 connectors at the

270
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:39,229
moment and it's growing not fast but

271
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:44,019
it's going maybe after this talk

272
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:07,269
[Applause]

273
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:15,620
the bark off a domino

274
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,260
[Music]

275
00:19:26,620 --> 00:20:05,709
I'm going to

276
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,170
five zero question we need to be a bit

277
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:54,190
strict all the time yeah repeat the

278
00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:37,840
question so this is do the talk we can

279
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:47,580
do this for the recording later use

280
00:21:51,880 --> 00:22:02,740
thanks for coming yeah I did this talk

281
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,870
and it same setup different times and we

282
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,220
do a lot together because in - Rhineland

283
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,720
and for the fine fine that's where we

284
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,289
are from strong partnership and then

285
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,789
it's normal that we replace some

286
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:23,980
speakers at conferences when someone is

287
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:40,210
ill or second okay yeah I have to have

288
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:51,549
to be talking about the video here it's

289
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,610
okay I need some some power

290
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,010
[Music]

291
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:49,919
[Music]

292
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,010
the device is only seeing one one screen

293
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:11,460
that there doesn't detect the presenter

294
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,510
you

295
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:54,020
yeah yeah it's so if you have the remote

296
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,580
for the predictive you can just take

297
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:03,340
this serious ghost thing so it is better

298
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,530
though you have to switch to four for

299
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,909
column for sir yeah and it was six 1669

300
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:20,200
before that what's the problem

301
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,809
also it is Bethulia

302
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,450
boy I

303
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:44,129
- please we have five minutes left

304
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,890
so one thing

305
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,950
one place behind

306
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,950
okay

307
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
okay

308
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,269
before we start I'm here from Munich

309
00:28:55,269 --> 00:29:00,970
today Munich is ill and at home and we

310
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,519
all have to send best wishes to unique

311
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,090
to Germany that next year she could come

312
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,919
to FOSDEM and hopefully present this

313
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,559
talk by ourselves but I think I could

314
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,379
give you the same input today and we

315
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:25,989
marched a little bit our presentation -

316
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,409
to have the same content and I think I

317
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:35,729
could present and inspire you by the

318
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:39,009
idea of the talk and the topic exit

319
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:47,229
excesses human rights so no so my name

320
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,450
is philipp but it will be the first

321
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,639
slide and then i will give you a short

322
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,489
overview about me

323
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:58,200
so when the door was closed our Sigma

324
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,639
strict strict time plan here
