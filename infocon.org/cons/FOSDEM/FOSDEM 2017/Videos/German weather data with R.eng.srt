1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,480
I'd like to start with a question who a

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,969
few has heard of our the program

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,330
language review has worked with it you

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,190
who have you kind of regularly works

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,500
with it okay that's a few people that's

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,439
pretty cool I wrote an hour pack edge

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
because I was using data from the German

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,290
weather service and had a hard time

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,820
figuring out what they have available

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,489
they have made her data files and stuff

11
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,340
but they're not always exactly correct

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,390
with what's actually available and I've

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,010
needed this for a couple of projects and

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,050
yeah at some point it became a package

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,879
and it's now online you can use it and

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,510
I'd like to show you what it does so the

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,300
German Weather Service or in german

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,519
deutsch have italians that's what DW d

19
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,910
stands for has a lot of datasets online

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,329
like over 25,000 files and that's a bit

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,989
too much to inspect manually also it's

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,510
difficult to search all that and as i

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,980
said they're not always completely

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,380
consistent also not in formatting like

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,590
column widths and stuff like that here's

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,710
a screenshot of the ftp server where

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,509
that it's located and you can maybe see

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,899
that this is a summer medium length URL

29
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:20,340
and they're a bunch of files available

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,920
there so our saves the day with that

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,719
package is pretty easy to harness all

32
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,439
that data and download and use it so so

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,909
much for the motivation i'd like to

34
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,880
continue with few slides on how to use

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,939
it a couple of things what you can do

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,539
with it

37
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,460
a couple of application examples and

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,380
then but on the first community role so

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,869
you want to get the URL find out which

40
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,909
which is the file you want download it

41
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,659
and read it and then i have a bit on

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,420
plotting and mapping so the first part

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,850
is fairly straightforward you load the

44
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,890
library and then with the select DVD

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,320
function you can just put in the name of

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,270
the station that you want and then tell

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,570
it i want for example daily data of the

48
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,690
climate observations from from recent

49
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,090
data they have always the data separated

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,960
in recent files and historical files so

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
you can update data easily with small

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,270
relatively small the recent files so

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,520
that will give you what you are Lu want

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,010
to use and that is what you put into a

55
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,090
data DVD to download it and it will give

56
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,680
you a couple of messages telling you

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,810
what it's doing the nice part is this is

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,840
our vectorized so you can say I want all

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,460
the stations for a certain combination

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,760
of parameters or I want all the data for

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,700
a certain station or whatever and it

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,770
will give you a progress bar and stuff

63
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,760
and then start at file in some place on

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,070
your computer and then the last step is

65
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,290
to actually read that it's a zip file so

66
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,660
you need to unzip it it needs to be read

67
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,720
correctly and converted and that's what

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
read WD does and then you just put in

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
that file name and then you can look at

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,240
it what you get back is is a data frame

71
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,720
and has German names and currently I'm

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,000
keeping that because that's what your

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,550
original stuff is they're not quite

74
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,770
consistent about using English folder

75
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,840
names but then German names in your

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,880
files and converts data or datum formats

77
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,410
as far as I can tell it works kind of

78
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,380
correctly so far and then you can use

79
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,470
regular our code to to plot stuff for

80
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,840
example I want to plot two columns off

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,210
it make that align don't plot anything

82
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,820
on the x-axis and then make the numbers

83
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,710
ago upright and then you can use some

84
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,270
other stuff that I also have available

85
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,940
to to create some nice day taxes and

86
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,420
stuff is pretty regular our code that

87
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,060
you can then continue to use of that so

88
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,730
it's a bit our focus but I guess that's

89
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,700
ok I mean that's what I work with and

90
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,000
then I have an interactive map also

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,130
fairly easy to to get that and you can

92
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,200
then zoom in and stuff like you can

93
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,079
always do with interactive maps and then

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,579
if you click on the points you get some

95
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,910
some meta information will tell you like

96
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,500
what's the name of the station where is

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,540
it located how many files are available

98
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,080
for that station things like that and

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,660
then you can

100
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,640
I also get more information to see what

101
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,270
exact files are available there so I'd

102
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,830
like to show you three applications

103
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,060
things that I've been doing with that

104
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,320
one of them is to get a long-term

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,980
climate graph at least in climate

106
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,930
science this is what people like to look

107
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,570
at I'll show you the picture in a minute

108
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,600
it's fairly straightforward again you

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
you select what you want I want monthly

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,460
data from Potsdam the historical data

111
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,950
put that into my climate data frame do a

112
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,650
bit of managing to get actually

113
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,630
long-term averages of the monthly

114
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,320
averages and then I also have a function

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,570
for creating climate graphs available

116
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,090
and it will give you something like that

117
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,680
who of you is familiar of climate graphs

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,550
a few so briefly explain what it does

119
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,130
you have the temperature here in red and

120
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,180
that means over a long term the average

121
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,420
say July temperature is like 18 degrees

122
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,760
in Potsdam which is in the northwest of

123
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,050
Germany near Berlin and then you have

124
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,510
the rainfall on the right axis this is

125
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,000
on a different scale but it relates to

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,190
the temperature by a factor of two this

127
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,770
is in millimeters per month so it's

128
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,960
rainfall sums again the average is over

129
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,710
long terms and if you look at that you

130
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,710
can see that imparts them usually things

131
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,470
are not water limited in other places in

132
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,700
the world where there's not so much

133
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,950
water but higher temperatures you can of

134
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,870
course imagine that that vegetation and

135
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,330
stuff has more problems with draught and

136
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,669
then you would see file this below the

137
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,590
temperature and and there see a yellow

138
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,330
region and stuff so it's a quick

139
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,630
indicator to get an idea of how

140
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,720
vegetation at a certain climatic

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,990
climatic region works or water

142
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,320
availability and stuff it's pretty

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,710
common in in geography and climate

144
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,470
science and stuff so it's fairly easy to

145
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,210
actually do that for any station in

146
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,970
Germany I mean Indiana pretty much looks

147
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,590
somewhat similar because it's all in one

148
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,129
time and we

149
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,029
but that's not too hard another thing I

150
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,369
was in a task force looking at the brown

151
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,099
spa flash flood that happened last year

152
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,979
at the end of May maybe you have heard

153
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,089
about it or read about it in the

154
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,389
newspapers it was a pretty amazing flat

155
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,050
like probably there's never in human

156
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,159
memory been such thing before they're

157
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,559
likely actually in the first part of the

158
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,819
20th century there has been something

159
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,769
like that anyway it was a lot a lot a

160
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,889
lot of rain fallen in a few hours and

161
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,599
most of it actually and in within one

162
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,509
hour created a huge flash flood very

163
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,110
local thing it's just one village or two

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,929
villages being being washed away by that

165
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,219
well actually not completely washed away

166
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:30,569
but a couple of houses were washed away

167
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,699
luckily in that place nobody died in

168
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,229
other places in Germany people actually

169
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,509
died so this was a pretty serious thing

170
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,169
and I'm in a research training group

171
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,149
that has the idea that there has to be a

172
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,919
task force looking at something like

173
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,259
that which is do you event reaches for

174
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,039
that and we wanted to look at the

175
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,019
rainfall from that event now of course

176
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,449
there was no gauge directly in the vinda

177
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,419
village but there was something closely

178
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,309
what you see here in red on the map

179
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,979
it's the catchment area of where the

180
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,539
flash flood happened so it's really

181
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,959
small it's just six square kilometers

182
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,249
and then the sums of rainfall along the

183
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:16,019
day along the event on the map so you

184
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,809
can basically see that there is not so

185
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,939
much rainfall here but then close to the

186
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,619
area there's like a hundred millimeters

187
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,439
within one day which is like totally

188
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,969
exceptional you would expect this to

189
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,729
happen like every few hundred years on

190
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,979
average now that's if there is no

191
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:37,259
climate change so if you were to do

192
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,719
something like this get the recent data

193
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,899
around a certain region you could get

194
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,329
that very fairly easily with the map

195
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,870
then it showed actually now that we have

196
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,699
the map we didn't have that at the time

197
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:53,370
we created this we found out we actually

198
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,139
missed even one station here which would

199
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,370
have given a bit more information even

200
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,710
and then you can also get the time

201
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,770
series of those stations not all of them

202
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,650
but of Allah they have hourly data which

203
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,660
is definitely the minimum resolution you

204
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,140
need for looking at something like that

205
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,580
basically showing when did the event

206
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,910
pass by so it's a lot of rainfall here

207
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,040
staggering here for some time did not

208
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,200
move very fast and then it kind of moved

209
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,500
up again which created this horrible

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,280
flood all right the third thing I'd like

211
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,170
to show you is also on extreme rainfall

212
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,350
the idea is that warm air can contain

213
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,970
more moisture it's a really really

214
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,430
simplified explanation of the Klaus is

215
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,890
club Heron relationship and you would

216
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,620
expect to follow that kind of the red

217
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,780
line that kind of shows how much

218
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,300
potential moisture that can be an error

219
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,650
given a certain temperature what we see

220
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,810
is that in fact it goes up even steeper

221
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,910
than the red line but that's fine and

222
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,610
what we see is the temperature estimate

223
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,650
that happens like in one of a thousand

224
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,930
events 99.9 percent quantile and that

225
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,820
Rises and Rises and Rises then it drops

226
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,450
off again

227
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,150
each Green Line is one of around hundred

228
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,170
50 stations across Germany and and this

229
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,110
behavior it's kind of regular it happens

230
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,960
every at every place and this happens

231
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
all over the world there's a bit of

232
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,710
research on that it's kind of special I

233
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,940
stopped it we probably haven't read

234
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,080
about it what we figured out is maybe so

235
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,310
there's been a couple of theories why

236
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,470
this is happening like there's it's like

237
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,930
really hard there's not so much moisture

238
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,330
available so that's why it does not rain

239
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,780
much more intensively and we figured out

240
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,660
you know at these places there's often

241
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,570
not very lot of data because it does not

242
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,780
happen so often there in Germany this is

243
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,340
the dew point temperature so real

244
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,440
temperature is is the air temperature is

245
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,920
usually a bit higher even is it's so

246
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,610
high and there is rainfall so we figured

247
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,140
out you know if if you have small

248
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,380
samples you probably underestimate what

249
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,320
you would actually be expecting also

250
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,360
because extreme rainfall is so local

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,310
it's quite likely it has not even been

252
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,680
observed yet at the measuring stations

253
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,920
but it may really be possible in between

254
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,090
which would be an important question

255
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,900
given there is climate change and given

256
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,400
people in cities do planning for how

257
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,740
much water they need to expect within

258
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,260
say half an hour or something and how

259
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,560
often the the drainage system is allowed

260
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,700
to fail and stuff like that so we

261
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,070
developed a technique to get good

262
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,590
quantile estimates even in small samples

263
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,990
then we figured out already other people

264
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,400
had done very similar stuff and there's

265
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,530
a lot of Tyrian on it but it's good if

266
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,180
you find out something that then you

267
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,410
find out you been accepted anyway if you

268
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,940
apply that you see a completely

269
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,250
different picture the same same kind of

270
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,980
thing here but then it kind of continues

271
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,430
to rise now there is a lot more

272
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,320
uncertainty going on and it's somewhat

273
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,960
unlikely that you have like 200 or 300

274
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,930
millimeters within one hour I mean it's

275
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,280
not to say it's impossible but it's

276
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,410
getting very very unlikely if the

277
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,330
maximum ever measured is like 80 or

278
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,810
something but the point is even though

279
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,090
we haven't measured very very extreme

280
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,920
precipitation on very hot days yeah

281
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,470
maybe possible so and it was kind of

282
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,010
nice to look at this with a whole bunch

283
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,630
of weather stations across Germany

284
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,990
alright one slide on how the community

285
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,990
helped in putting all of this together I

286
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,530
mean we're the first conference you

287
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,560
probably all know Stack Overflow I

288
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,570
benefit greatly from that I have once in

289
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,500
a while I post something there two parts

290
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,060
of the community kind of lobbied the

291
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,280
German Weather Service into publishing

292
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,710
all the data I mean it spec state pack

293
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,940
tags paid anyway so why not have it

294
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,130
public and they were actually open for

295
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,350
that the reasoning in about two years

296
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,080
ago or something I believe they started

297
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,000
publishing all that so it's available

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,260
online for free which is pretty cool

299
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,230
then there's this whole our package

300
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,450
distribution infrastructure that you can

301
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,210
use to create and share something like

302
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,630
that

303
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,370
it's really great also this map has been

304
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,010
pretty easy to create it gets you're all

305
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,980
familiar with leaflet see lot of nodding

306
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
in space so that room I guess that's

307
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,110
expected there's an hour package linking

308
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,570
right to its it's like just a few lines

309
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,290
of code to even create that so I'd like

310
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,390
to finish off if saying that free and

311
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,250
open source software is awesome not a

312
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,780
big surprise at a conference like this

313
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,450
the German Weather Service has become

314
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,090
pretty awesome and since you cannot have

315
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,890
too many awesomes on one slide I'll not

316
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,450
say that my package is awesome but I'll

317
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,990
say it you can use it to use all that

318
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,050
data very easily so thanks very much for

319
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,960
your attention

320
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,270
[Applause]

321
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,270
yeah

322
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,660
so the question is what's the origin of

323
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,019
the data so there's a lot of radar data

324
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,689
also available I am using observational

325
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,480
data from climate stations operated by

326
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,249
the German Weather Service sometimes

327
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,899
since a very long time maybe you noted

328
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,509
when I showed the climate grave for

329
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:52,600
Potsdam that it's been around since 1893

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,639
so for do I'm a deer ecologist but any

331
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,279
people working in something like that

332
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,709
this is very very rich data stuff

333
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,540
because you need long time series to

334
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,899
look at trends you know quantify climate

335
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,420
change and all that and so this comes

336
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,689
from observational stations there are

337
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,549
like 5000 in Germany they don't operate

338
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,239
all anymore people do they're expensive

339
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,429
to run and now with the new advance of

340
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,790
radar and stuff all over the world there

341
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,029
are less and less climate stations but

342
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,129
this is our observational stuff and it's

343
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,730
measured by traditional rain gauges

344
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,019
partly that had this writing thing on a

345
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,309
rotating cylinder with paper on it that

346
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,619
has been digitized partly with new

347
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:47,889
measurements it's kind of a mixture that

348
00:15:47,889 --> 00:16:04,689
you would read about in the metadata so

349
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,100
the question is do I have plans to

350
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,799
include data from all over Europe or the

351
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,889
world and kind of organize that into a

352
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,199
common structure currently not because

353
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,549
theoretically I'm writing a PhD and not

354
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:22,149
doing this kind of stuff so this is a

355
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,819
hobby project is kind of large for

356
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,009
America the data is available fairly

357
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,660
easily there's an R package reason for

358
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:35,980
that from the NOAA so yes would be an

359
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,139
interesting project it's a bit beyond my

360
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,399
current time capabilities

361
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,790
other standards for communicating this

362
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,810
type of information

363
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,329
yeah so there are a couple of standards

364
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,170
in gathering the data for example like

365
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,079
air temperature if not specified in

366
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,270
elevation is measured at 2 meters height

367
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,300
stuff like that which makes it somewhat

368
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,250
comparable now of course not all

369
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,109
countries follow those standards and

370
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:26,270
stuff I have the general impression that

371
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,610
this data that is publicly available has

372
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,220
been filtered fairly well but I've also

373
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,440
worked with data from the indicates

374
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,530
austrian official weather service where

375
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,410
I had rainfall sums that were like two

376
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,210
or three thousand millimeters per year

377
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,340
whereas it should be like thousand two

378
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,870
hundred thousand five hundred maximum

379
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,610
and then at some point I figured out you

380
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,980
know they stopped or they had a gap in

381
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,340
their measurements from say July 13 to

382
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,580
September 27 or whatever it was and

383
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,070
instead of having n/a data there they

384
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,350
just interpolated linearly which is of

385
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,660
course not valid for precipitation right

386
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,550
it's very unlikely that every day we'll

387
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,290
see a little bit more preservation than

388
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,950
previous day so even if standards you do

389
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,910
have filter out stuff

390
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,350
yeah what's next for my project getting

391
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,140
a feedback from more people like if you

392
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,290
have any ideas about this also I'll be

393
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,780
spreading this in the community around

394
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,520
that my university and the research

395
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,960
institutes close to it

396
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,700
I'm in touch with two German Weather

397
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,520
Service actually and seeing what's

398
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,250
what's coming around what bugs there are

399
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,530
still in there or what features people

400
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,050
request yeah its ongoing project as I

401
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,330
said it's a hobby projects I really need

402
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,890
to watch out spending too much time on

403
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:10,640
it what are good packages to work within

404
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,650
are for geospatial data I probably am

405
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,300
not quite a correct person to answer

406
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,100
this I don't do too much but of course

407
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,340
there's the RG dau package

408
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,640
there's packages to to a couple are with

409
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,710
qgs I've worked with that a little bit

410
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,640
yeah nobody suggestions probably oh yeah

411
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,800
sure that the basic package that handles

412
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,520
off that is SP for spatial stuff but I

413
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,320
don't think I've even accessed that

414
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,540
directly it's our in the background for

415
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:58,160
me yeah and there is a task view on Fran

416
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,400
so Fran or C Ron is the comprehensive

417
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,410
our archive network or people publish

418
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,780
our packages and they also have task

419
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,470
views that kind of give an introduction

420
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,110
like you know what are common packages

421
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,830
you would use

422
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,100
thank you very much

423
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,869
[Applause]
