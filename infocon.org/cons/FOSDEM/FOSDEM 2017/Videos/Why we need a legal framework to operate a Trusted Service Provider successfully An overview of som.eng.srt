1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,110
so for next speaker is right hard words

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:15,030
I want to say welcome to all of you and

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,840
my short lecture I will show the basics

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,390
of WPI a which spells to world privacy

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:35,130
and identity Association okay so my name

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,570
is volatile

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,230
he taught me given into the introduce my

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,990
name is hi not moods I worked in the IT

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,390
since 1985 and I've been selected as

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,070
president of WPI a at the first general

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:02,180
meeting I want to give a short overview

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,069
what we need a legal framework to

13
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,310
operate the trusted service provider

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,619
successfully and I will show you the

15
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,189
reasons why we do it and I will show you

16
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,609
the way we will do it when we started

17
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,149
and you know this it's some kind of good

18
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,980
practice you start with a kind of

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,329
[Music]

20
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,329
brainstorming

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,860
and what you do is just number all the

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,980
issues you have to deal with and I give

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,180
just a few examples what we have to

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,660
consider for example finance finance

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,570
will include the management of

26
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,770
membership fees donations payments and

27
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,690
of course tax because the takes office

28
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,139
always one gets its part of your money

29
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,140
and you have to organize it very well

30
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,750
you can organize it if you have not a

31
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,750
community but an association the

32
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,020
association is represented by a

33
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,450
management power and this management

34
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,620
board acts on behalf of the association

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,800
the same thing is in regards to contract

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,380
management's if you see what you have to

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,870
do well here how many contracts you have

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,140
to sign then you see you need a data

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,860
center to operate something you need

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,799
contracts to manage the relations

41
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,470
between your trusted service provider

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,860
and your customers and you need

43
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,360
contracts for example for insurances

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,110
next item is Human Resources without a

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,360
personal staff who is doing the things

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,780
there is no progress so you have to

47
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,380
organize it in a way that it will manage

48
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,200
or match your targets though to

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,500
infrastructure you know the tasks you

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,070
have you will run a website for example

51
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,799
you will run some software so that you

52
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,530
can communicate in the teams you will do

53
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,760
and write software and manage it and so

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,530
on see the item risk management risk

55
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,060
management is a hottub to do because

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,569
you have to write down any possibility

57
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:57,110
which may crash you down and the next is

58
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,840
you must write it's really a clear

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
formula clear way to see and then to

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,180
have an overview about this and then

61
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,150
when you see risks which may happen then

62
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,080
go and try to minimize it at least you

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,529
need a documentation of all of our

64
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,440
business processes and all actions in

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,500
the meanings of keeping an archive and

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,360
keeping it up to date and these issues

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,260
are not all there are many many more

68
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,270
issues you have to consider and please

69
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,710
keep this in mind as a trusted service

70
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:50,840
provider you are working in a market the

71
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,910
market of PKI is complex and the AI

72
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,169
environment is a little bit more complex

73
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:09,380
so if you see the PKI description which

74
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,470
is made by internet and during on task

75
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,080
force called RFC 5280 there are laid out

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,639
and written in details the requirements

77
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,880
how PKI will work

78
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,110
the browsers like for example Mozilla

79
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,110
Microsoft edge maybe Google Chrome or

80
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,410
whatsoever will follow this requirement

81
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,530
is oft 5280 and sometimes it happens and

82
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,610
that is what we would see that they have

83
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,580
different views about the same thing

84
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,100
which happens and that we'll need for

85
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,640
example to the fact that their trust

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,630
rows are filled with the names of CA

87
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,250
companies but they are not identical

88
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,710
everyone who wants to surf the Internet

89
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,850
in the way of let's fake trust and build

90
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,860
up a trust so has its old view whom he

91
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:31,280
will trust in 2005 the CA the part of

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,970
the CL market and the B which stands for

93
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,600
the browsers organized a forum the forum

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,230
is nothing else as a discussion forum

95
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,390
and what they try is to unify the views

96
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:55,670
and the interpretations of RFC 5280 this

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,760
part has well-known to many many people

98
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,550
in the community but there is a new

99
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,630
player coming which is not yet very

100
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,840
recognized in the community and this new

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,780
player is that project in the a you

102
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,550
called a EDA's and AE das has a target

103
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,910
which has described test as the internal

104
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,140
market in the you will be unified and

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,530
this will be done latest in 2020 so

106
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,510
there are only a few years left what

107
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,200
they do in regards to certificate

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,670
authorities is that they created a new

109
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,800
level of trusted

110
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,449
which they call cube TSP Accu TSP is not

111
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,400
only a trusted service provider it's a

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,889
qualified trusted service provider and

113
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,860
the hope is that they can man make much

114
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,740
more money than before you may see this

115
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,669
attempt of installation qts piece like

116
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,580
for example building a digital ball

117
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,389
around the Schengen space so that they

118
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,190
keep Europe as a single market and

119
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,800
others say and will tell you it will

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,680
help the world to communicate better and

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,479
more safe and so on that's the one side

122
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,680
of the world of PK ice the other side is

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,458
that the same document the RFC 5280

124
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,700
distinguishes between Internet and

125
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,260
internal internal means that you use the

126
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,270
paper I system in your own networks and

127
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,600
these networks have no connection to the

128
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,760
internet so the roots are not strong you

129
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,170
the roots may be not abate and the

130
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,459
reason why you do it is very simple you

131
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,770
can keep your internal network in turn

132
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,040
this is used by almost always all

133
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
national governments in the world the

134
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,040
biggest internal peiki is run in the US

135
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,329
administration in Europe it's run by the

136
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,449
government of the German Republic and

137
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,300
you will see the internals if you visit

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,370
the website of BSI where you can see the

139
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,390
complete structure of the internal PPI

140
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,570
of the German administration

141
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,120
there is another player in the market

142
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,810
that is Taylor trust Taylor trust is

143
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,650
some nonprofit association and the

144
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,580
members are big business when they

145
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,900
started the members who are for example

146
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,260
the company's immense telecom and so on

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,160
and what they do is they run a project

148
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,500
called EBC a that's European rich CA

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,800
this project is run to make the internal

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,270
paper is to the partners and

151
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,080
participates of this model known and

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,590
integrate it into their browsers they

153
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,730
run an LDAP server and if you know the

154
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,280
exact email address of one of the

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,360
employees you can write and use an S

156
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,590
mime email signed and encrypted and you

157
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,210
do not need to come in touch before you

158
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,540
just ask that an observer and that will

159
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,430
serve you the appropriate certificate so

160
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,440
the question is what parts will WPI a

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,950
serve and the answer is simple both

162
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,580
sides we want to operate in the market

163
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,670
as the trusted service provider and will

164
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,300
deploy certificates for free and our

165
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,090
software is open to all will be under an

166
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,600
open license for your private

167
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,170
convenience you may download it and use

168
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,380
it

169
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,620
well the solution in the this area must

170
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,149
be based on trust

171
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,069
privacy is a right and privacy and

172
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:01,360
that's written by v1 privacy is not a

173
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,379
commodity that can be sold its utility

174
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,420
and various cultural and social settings

175
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,480
can defer but privacy is a human right

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,019
and that was written in the UN world

177
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,870
public sector report in the year 20 and

178
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,800
3 last week we saw in Brussels

179
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,750
an event from data protection officers

180
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,329
and security interests and so on

181
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,920
and this guy and mr. Carbone lugar wrote

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,490
a tweet I catch that by some coincidence

183
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,430
and what he wrote is the you cannot

184
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,850
monetize fundamental rights to make it

185
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,060
subject to commercial transaction and

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,189
there are words written in the year 2017

187
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,709
fourteen years ago the UN world public

188
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,680
sector report said the difficult is that

189
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
a protection of privacy is not higher on

190
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,759
the global or even national political

191
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,149
agendas yet and that yet is still hope

192
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,370
so as I said the solution must be based

193
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,600
on trust next item is a very important

194
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,040
item is identity and the Australian

195
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,260
atmosphere Austrian administration

196
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,770
brought a strategy paper and they said

197
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,740
the citizens must have confidence that

198
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,420
their data will be received by the

199
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,590
addresses fast and reliably an open and

200
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,150
free internet the protection of personal

201
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,190
data as well as the integrity of

202
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,620
interconnected networks are the basis

203
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,560
for global prosperity security and the

204
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,080
promotion of human rights so what we can

205
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,140
see as human rights is always mentioned

206
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,340
and human rights can not be divided they

207
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,000
cannot be sold or made subject to a

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,170
market human rights should be accepted

209
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,670
to its full extent

210
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,940
if you need privacy if you accept

211
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,020
identity confidentiality and ignore the

212
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
rest then you don't accept human rights

213
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,810
because it's undividable and

214
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:38,220
cherry-picking not allowed see if you

215
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,230
see the environment and remember my

216
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,470
words then the next is very simple how

217
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,640
to manage this solution you all know and

218
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,029
we are in Brussels the center of former

219
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,899
Galia an old make seem called Caesar

220
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,040
schmuck symbols

221
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,730
Davida at Emperor and if you work as

222
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,209
project manager or manager of a company

223
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,459
or something you know that principle

224
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,000
divide and conquer what we have to obey

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,610
is we have to organize users and

226
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,720
customers they will have roles as

227
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,110
members as fellows as customers maybe as

228
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,500
employees on the other side we want to

229
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,980
operate a service which delivers or

230
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,589
deploys certificates and this will be

231
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,350
done for free and this CR will take part

232
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,570
in the market and based on all is our

233
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,550
association which is the charitable

234
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,300
nonprofit association and our members we

235
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,420
are looking for now is make propaganda

236
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,390
tell the world what we are doing tell it

237
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,880
your people tell your neighbor and

238
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,260
getting friends

239
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,269
the solution more detail is shown on

240
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,929
this page so what private identity and

241
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,809
Association is a charitable nonprofit

242
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,720
Association will be owner of brands

243
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,309
logos software and companies is open for

244
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,160
all human entities and by this required

245
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,410
the acceptance of the Universal

246
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,239
Declaration of Human Rights to its full

247
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:28,470
extent members will pay a membership fee

248
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,480
because you need some money to make

249
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,720
propaganda pay Flyers and burned and

250
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,749
there are many costs and enviar every

251
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:40,699
individual may get certificates for free

252
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:47,299
solution part 2 is to set up an

253
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:52,949
operating center set up and create a

254
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,290
certificate authority that's an

255
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,639
incorporated company of our association

256
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,579
will be owner of brands and logos

257
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,859
operating all tasks which data center

258
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,599
must provide and running on behalf of

259
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:15,059
WPI a only solution part 3 is a very

260
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,789
very old form of organization it's a

261
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:23,730
cooperative this cooperative is open for

262
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,559
associations and entities and our

263
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
requirement is the acceptance of the

264
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,620
Universal Declaration of Human Rights as

265
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,610
before members will pay a yearly

266
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,110
membership fee and that fee is used to

267
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,039
pay all costs of the operating CA

268
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,500
the important thing that is in this is

269
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,799
that you always remember we do not pay

270
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,730
certificates we pay and we organize an

271
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,580
environment to get the costs and that's

272
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,909
all we do the rest depends on the

273
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,150
participants so the nexus some

274
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,480
milestones as I said today we are

275
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
looking for new members I welcome every

276
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,340
one of you to share and join our

277
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,390
association the incorporation of the CR

278
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,799
is in phase let's call this in it the

279
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,950
same as in the incorporation of the

280
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:36,510
co-operative when we will have our

281
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,700
software tested and the CAS set up we

282
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,120
will go life and going life as meaning

283
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,299
that we will start without it from the

284
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,809
very first day we will never deploy to

285
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,510
the public certificates for the purpose

286
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,230
of testing or trying something like this

287
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,169
no we are finished with this book and

288
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,929
we'll start with an audit the audit will

289
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,150
need about one year and after we passed

290
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,340
it successfully and with flying colors

291
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,770
then we apply for membership and this

292
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,890
year Bay for this membership is required

293
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,010
to get the inclusion status of all

294
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,299
browsers and they cannot deny it if you

295
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,000
are in the same organization as they are

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,890
now so I think I have to say thanks

297
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,320
you've been grateful audience and I

298
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,190
would say visit our website and join the

299
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,260
world privacy and identity association

300
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,880
today if possible thank you

301
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,990
[Applause]

302
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,480
hi I just have a few points of sort of

303
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,330
clarification and a question so it is

304
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,190
not true that if you join the see a

305
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,860
browser forum all of the browser members

306
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,480
have to let you into their root stores

307
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,940
that there's not true but it is also not

308
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,040
required to be a member in order to

309
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,260
apply for root store admission so you

310
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,720
can apply whenever you like and you can

311
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,950
become a member of this year browser

312
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,980
forum at a later point the membership

313
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,690
requirements for the forum are that you

314
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,790
are in at least one root store so in

315
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,960
fact it's the other way around you have

316
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,850
to get into root store before you can

317
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,560
become a full member the question how

318
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,990
would you compare two questions then how

319
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,220
do you compare your service with

320
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,140
existing things like let's encrypt and

321
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,730
see a cert and secondly how do you go in

322
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,580
to solve the problem of ubiquity that is

323
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,970
to say making sure that everyone trusts

324
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,620
your certificates as quickly as possible

325
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,660
in order that anyone would want to use

326
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,830
them easily answered let's encrypt just

327
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:12,150
not they do not a reliable work the

328
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,910
certificates are generated by a machine

329
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,220
used for another machine and what they

330
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,160
are doing is not accountable in the

331
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:28,200
meanings of legal fluids may read and I

332
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,220
give you the advice to do so the UN the

333
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,470
Committee for international trade laws

334
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:40,490
has published two big documents and both

335
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,770
about the commercial market and the use

336
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,830
of digital certificates and they say

337
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,610
that the certificates generated from a

338
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,990
machine to use to secure the

339
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,370
communication between two machines are

340
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,650
not reliable so it's out of scope

341
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,360
want to have a reliable certificate the

342
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,420

343
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,180
side of the CA and a human on the side

344
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:16,510

345
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,580
