1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,170
note here and he will be talking about

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,780
one of the most exciting and hot areas

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,720
in big data these days which is deep

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,219
learning yeah

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,869
so I'm going to be a researcher at

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,900
Swedish Institute of computer science I

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,119
was supposed to do the presentation with

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,670
Jim during that he couldn't come here

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,449
today so what I would speak about is

10
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,690
deep learning on the platform we are

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,450
developing can help people to start with

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,719
deep learning because the thing is that

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,020
my team at the Swedish Institute of

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,809
computer science and we have created a

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,030
start-up and we are what we are doing is

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,329
developing a new adult distribution it's

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,879
the first European Arab distribution on

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,220
somatic aspect of it can be very useful

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,470
for starting with deep learning to start

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,740
with raise a question what are the

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,350
factors that all back artificial

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,680
intelligence today if we look at bender

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
we can think that it's alcohol on sex

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,850
but according to andre capaci I don't

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,070
exactly know you pronounce his name if

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,229
you don't know him he is working at open

27
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,320
ie he on his blog is a quite entry on

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,659
blog in deep learning so this situation

29
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,229
is taken from his blog and they say that

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,619
there is four factor that all back

31
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,420
artificial intelligence first one is a

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,180
compute its a compute power we have so

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,799
this is ad where this is our imagination

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,970
you are our power for our GPU CPU on

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,600
things like that the second one is the

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,630
data is that to do deep longing you do

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,719
you need big data you need big data that

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,799
are clean that right now it's not so

39
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,410
easy to find them the that are kind of

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,080
all over the place on internet don't

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,910
really know where to find them and you

42
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,740
when you find some data you don't know

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,050
if they are really clean something like

44
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,550
that then the third component it is

45
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,680
algorithm so it's what you will do if

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,300
you work on if you want to develop new

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,520
artificial intelligence system and the

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,100
last one is infrastructure is what do

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,470
you run your deep learning system on so

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,380
is the operating system but also where

51
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,200
you store your data on thing like that

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,500
on what Oh platform address the point

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,750
that all perform address is the data

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,840
problem on the infrastructure problem so

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,520
we'll start with the data problem so the

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,010
data challenge how do you find good on

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,800
it using data okay if you are in a big

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,470
company your Spotify or you have the

59
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,150
data that house they own you can use

60
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,920
them but if you are a researcher and you

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,390
want to experiment with data you don't

62
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,430
necessarily have them there and you look

63
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,490
for them and then it's right now it's

64
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,380
kind of going to e care but going

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,320
directly to the last part you have data

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,700
all over the place

67
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,160
they are all in box you have to find the

68
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,380
box that go together you have to bring

69
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,410
that out on by yourself and then you

70
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,510
build it and then you find out that oh

71
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,670
it's not what I wanted so so how can we

72
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,450
help with that yeah and then what our

73
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,090
problem now as I say you bring it back

74
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,190
home how do you do that right now is

75
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,170
that we don't see but it's not so

76
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,910
important it's a line of code that tell

77
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,209
you how to download some data from from

78
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,090
s3 on most of the time you have to run

79
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,670
it 100 time to have all the data on if

80
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,160
one of them crash in the middle you have

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,760
to do it manually to find out we are the

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,370
student a PhD student downloading

83
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,070
whether that

84
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,040
it took him one week the first time and

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,950
then we implemented the client to

86
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,510
download the data and it went a lot

87
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,250
faster but underneath each you have data

88
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,900
and you want to make them public how do

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,090
you do that there is no straightforward

90
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,700
solution now you can okay you can put

91
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,460
them on Amazon or on Google cloud but

92
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,060
then we pay for that so we pay for each

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,990
time someone download and then you have

94
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,790
to make some webpage to publish

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,570
something like that there isn't no very

96
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,550
nice platform where in few click you can

97
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,000
say okay now my data appealing and this

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,750
is what this is one of the thing we do

99
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,630
in no platform I wanted to make a demo

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,260
but the problem is that for I can't

101
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,320
connect my computer to the video

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,120
projector on the demo so I will describe

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,460
the demo on so some squid short because

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,560
the demo is dois is running we have

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,900
deployed to the automation in my lab and

106
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,240
I need my computer to access to them

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
because of firewall problem but so the

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,460
idea that we are to the optimizing with

109
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,919
a full stack with the hop stack so which

110
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,710
contain we wished all the data in HDFS

111
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,440
and then use Y on thing like that so

112
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,450
it's a full atop stack and we have data

113
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,150
in that on we want to share them and we

114
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,680
have a nice interface to see your data

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,190
in the in the HDFS I will show it a

116
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,630
little more when I speak over the

117
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,330
infrastructure but we have data in one

118
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,660
of the via virtual machine and what we

119
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,300
do is just we right-click on them on say

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,290
shell is that other is a shelter that

121
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,530
and then this data now public they have

122
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,080
a description which is a file Winley

123
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,100
file that is in

124
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
the in the folder on that describe what

125
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,300
are in the data and then we on the other

126
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,520
via termination we can search for the

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,000
name of this data or for something in

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,070
the description we use elastic search

129
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,050
for the research and we will find the

130
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,140
will get the result of all the the

131
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,600
public that I said that out there and we

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,760
will say okay download it screenshot are

133
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,870
very bad when we download it we say to

134
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,300
which project we want to add them and

135
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,960
then if it's HDFS we can directly dump

136
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,900
it to HDFS so if it's stuff that are the

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,060
good format for Kafka we can also put

138
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,660
them in Kafka and once we have done that

139
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,560
it stopped downloading and we can start

140
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,860
proceeding on them how does it work in

141
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,650
the bed the background is it's a

142
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,330
peer-to-peer torrent like protocol so if

143
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,420
a lot of people have these data set in

144
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,880
the cluster then it will go faster to

145
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,000
delay them and then we use the lab dot

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,060
for let bat for the transport protocol

147
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,660
the idea is that left at it is known as

148
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,870
creative so we know that if you have

149
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,150
that I said that our public it may not

150
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,670
be your priority to upload them to

151
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,740
people that want to download them your

152
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,570
priority is to serve the people that use

153
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,440
your cluster directly so let bat is good

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,320
for that because it will use only the

155
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,070
bandwidth that is not used by TCP and so

156
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,260
if people are not using your cluster it

157
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,450
will be able to upload at maximum speed

158
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,490
but as soon as you have TCP connections

159
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,280
that start to use your cluster it will

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,130
go down on useless bond with the other

161
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,610
interests of lab rat is that it works a

162
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,599
lot better than the anticip you eyelet

163
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,260
on CI bond with connection which are the

164
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,270
connection you have when you have

165
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,610
cluster on both sides of the Atlantic

166
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,620
sourcing like that

167
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,870
I had number that because the problem

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,990
with TCP is that the congestion windows

169
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,640
is patty reacted to a latency and so

170
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,060
when the latency increases the

171
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,150
throughput at which TCP can transmit

172
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,700
over on the network is going down let

173
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,360
that is is measuring the latency on

174
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,580
these looking at the change in latency

175
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,630
to know if it should decrease or

176
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,390
increase the throughput at which its on

177
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,970
so and this has also the advantage that

178
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,220
it's under better packet loss

179
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,770
because it will not take a packet loss

180
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,100
as okay now I need to decrease the size

181
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,860
of my window by half it will say okay

182
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,930
there is one packet that was lost but

183
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,730
globally the latency is the same so

184
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,500
maybe it was just these packets which

185
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,400
can happen on very lonely

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,460
lastly we don't load the piece in order

187
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,550
so you can start to process what you are

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,120
downloading while it's downloading so

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,180
now for the infrastructure part so if

190
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,890
you want to develop artificial

191
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,860
intelligence on you want to be to do the

192
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,900
artificial entities on nose alcoholism

193
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,950
and stuff like that you don't

194
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,110
necessarily want to deal with all the

195
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,700
infrastructure and all that you don't

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,720
want to be this guide for that we

197
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,650
propose to use a ton software on a Duke

198
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,380
so white onshore flow if you were there

199
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,160
to presentation ago it was two or three

200
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,310
you saw that there is a lot of existing

201
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,430
system to do deep learning which will

202
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,470
start off low because it's the big one

203
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,240
right now is the one everybody use it's

204
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,560
Google behind it so I guess it's helped

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,670
personally more developing the I do part

206
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,560
so I don't know so much about it tons of

207
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,500
flow sorry about that

208
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,370
and then we think that a dupe is a it's

209
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,120
good for because you want to have big

210
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,110
data at the beginning the data you need

211
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,590
to Train

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,660
you

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,089
your loop is not so good it's the reason

214
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,269
is that the way people do it is that

215
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,009
they have the data in I do they have

216
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,050
tons of ruin on another machine and they

217
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,420
take the data to weapons of fluids they

218
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,230
went on the floor

219
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,680
they run the algorithm and then they put

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,779
back the result in art this is not

221
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:03,130
efficient luckily they have been now it

222
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,769
has been developed system so that you

223
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,899
can run tons of flu use that as a tear

224
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,209
in a dupe and you know platform we have

225
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,660
integrated all of this together so that

226
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,000
people can directly run the are terms of

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,630
flow job in Japan on using data in

228
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,060
Hadoop without having to do all this

229
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,440
transfer it's not perfect yet there are

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,040
still a lot of work to do and this will

231
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,880
be part of a future work so I will just

232
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,420
do a quick demo for system the

233
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:52,240
resolution will be shipped so all we

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,259
like so the thing is that we we run this

235
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:13,269
platform so the thing is that we have

236
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,639
the data center in luleå in the north of

237
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,800
Sweden the same place where I do pub the

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,349
worst Facebook as a European data center

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:42,230
I just want to zoom out Mitch okay oops

240
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,409
[Music]

241
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:16,280
yeah but I use the Swedish okay so so

242
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,370
the idea that we have a front on for

243
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:29,910
Duke system and we have a project system

244
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,120
where everything in a dupe is a project

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,330
on inside project you have users that

246
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,030
have different role and we unsure is

247
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,900
relation between the project so if you

248
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,450
have data in a dupe on the part of a

249
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,010
project you know that people that are

250
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,720
not part of this project contacts as to

251
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:58,160
it and then we can go to space nets it's

252
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,140
so on this data center we get access to

253
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,310
of student of the deep learning course

254
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,340
and they did their homework and on it on

255
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,800
one of the group did the space net

256
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:25,350
challenge so it's the idea on again when

257
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,060
they run it on the cluster they just

258
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,750
went to Zeppelin on in the plane

259
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,090
creating not book on the idea of space

260
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,150
net is that it's a satellite picture of

261
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,250
so it's not a notebook this is all terms

262
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,700
of Records understand picture so it's

263
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,570
some satellite picture of the

264
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,540
we're on the goal is to recognize if

265
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,900
there is building in the picture you can

266
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,430
see that when there is building it's

267
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,410
easily the part where we're building up

268
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:19,430
I want to first so so you can see with

269
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,220
this platform it's easy to download new

270
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,500
data set on to start working on the with

271
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,920
Zeppelin

272
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,500
no stinking thing

273
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,040
[Laughter]

274
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,130
[Music]

275
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,070
[Laughter]

276
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,079
[Music]

277
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,000
so future work I only wrote the future

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
work concerning terms of flow because

279
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,449
it's the only spot I spoke about for

280
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,990
platform so something we are working on

281
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,240
right now is a distributed sense of flow

282
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,359
so this exists but this is the we don't

283
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,839
think that the implementation is so good

284
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,020
right now and it's not it doesn't work

285
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,470
on yawn and as we want to run it on top

286
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,210
of a dupe we want to run it on top of

287
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,460
young so we have some people working on

288
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,140
that making that you can you will be

289
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,880
able in the future to say okay I want to

290
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,970
cluster with these machines and I want

291
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,130
to end distance or flow program on it

292
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,230
and then yon should take you out of that

293
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,530
then that means also adding some thing

294
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,960
too young because we want to be able to

295
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,409
and within feed even on GPUs which young

296
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,650
doesn't underwrite now right now Yun and

297
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,630
Leon the CPU on memory so we will we we

298
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,309
are also working on adding this

299
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:16,480
information into yarn so I was saying we

300
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,890
have a cluster up in Lille oh it's

301
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,150
already used so it's code that that are

302
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,510
that is in prediction that student on

303
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,740
research are using if you want to test

304
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,039
your code or platform you can either go

305
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,380
to hops dot IO and then you go you have

306
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,830
vagrant you can deploy the full tak with

307
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,149
a quantum start to play with it

308
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,700
we can also give you access to cluster

309
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,990
in Lunia

310
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,970
but you won't have access to the GPU

311
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,110
cards

312
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,030
because we don't have enough so we keep

313
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,700
them for still then I just want to thank

314
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,670
all these people so we have a lot of

315
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,410
enemy because we are research people so

316
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,299
it's a lot of students that I've been

317
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,580
working with us and that I've done the

318
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,150
very hard work but as you see we are

319
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,770
quite a small team working on this

320
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,950
project and we we created a startup to

321
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,330
develop it it's called logical clocks

322
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,700
and then we are looking for people that

323
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,179
want to either use on or system on give

324
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,179
us feedback or develop it it's all open

325
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,780
so you can go on github or ops to

326
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,850
Taiyuan have more information about this

327
00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:00,240
[Applause]

328
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,240
well thank you so much again
