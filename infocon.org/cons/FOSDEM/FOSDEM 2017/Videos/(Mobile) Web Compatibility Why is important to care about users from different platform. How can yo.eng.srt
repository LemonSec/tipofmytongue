1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:10,490
I'm replacing our own master of ceremony

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,510
the girl from from Romania otherwise

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,449
people think she's a vampire this is

5
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,340
from clues so I would like to introduce

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,840
to take this opportunity and introduce

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,500
you to Yana Kiran who is going to talk

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,369
about when come at the beginning right

9
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,800
see then I to be honest they didn't let

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,420
me do the introductions she has a whole

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,340
slide of her own doing stuff but I would

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,690
like to take this opportunity to say

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,150
that since one of the volunteers super

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,710
star and it's really amazing to have

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,380
people volunteering all the free time

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,890
into changing the web and make it more

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,290
open public accessible for everyone so I

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,950
would like to

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,150
[Applause]

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,959
[Applause]

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,380
[Music]

22
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,030
[Music]

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,039
[Music]

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,999
[Music]

25
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
in

26
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,080
[Music]

27
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:19,069
[Music]

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,349
[Music]

29
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:56,630
because this is my

30
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,089
[Music]

31
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,229
[Music]

32
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,779
so they start implementing them into the

33
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,919
final products without having

34
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,500
documentation without

35
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,329
[Music]

36
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,849
[Music]

37
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,649
[Music]

38
00:09:55,100 --> 00:11:06,350
in the future by elevator either like

39
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,620
that if it's not working today

40
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,779
[Music]

41
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,230
[Music]

42
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,579
[Music]

43
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,960
[Music]

44
00:12:48,649 --> 00:14:20,749
I am explaining to some communication

45
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,069
channels and browsing

46
00:14:28,630 --> 00:15:48,200
because you are here to learn more each

47
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,660
day and also to try to teach others and

48
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,589
mentor them so this is for me for sure

49
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,779
the rest can be like continued or added

50
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,279
more things but for me it was

51
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,740
[Music]

52
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,620
[Music]

53
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,208
to fix it

54
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,869
[Music]

55
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,259
[Music]

56
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,899
[Music]

57
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,830
it's also stuffed with details very

58
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,100
juicy details about platforms which are

59
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,750
most used which are the most encountered

60
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,320
bugs again

61
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,960
[Music]

62
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,430
