1
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,629
next is Tom spot Calloway hi everybody

2
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:12,119
so I have like 20 minutes to get through

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,889
it's about 45 minutes worth of stuff so

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,539
I'm gonna talk really fast and try and

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,070
take some questions at the end so if you

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,840
something sounds really strange it's

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,160
because I'm lying and you can just

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,029
embrace that and roll with it

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,409
yes so you can't have a legal talk from

10
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:29,519
somebody that's not a lawyer without

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,790
having a proper disclaimer so I'm not a

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,590
lawyer I work with them but I'm not one

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,780
so nothing in the presentation written

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,920
or spoken should be construed as legal

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,450
advice if you take it as legal advice

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,250
that's on you not on me you're screwed

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm not Wally worked for Red Hat for 16

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,600
years now and are occasionally allowed

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,210
to speak on behalf of my employer

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,410
nothing in this presentation represents

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,660
red have stance on anything opinions ice

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,760
cream flavors nothing so don't go

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,230
posting about this on slapshot I mean

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,730
like read this cuz that's not what that

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,320
means all right though the past none of

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
these pictures was loaded okay this is

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,720
gonna be less awesome when you find the

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,380
PDF half of my presentation is pictures

29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,830
and thus

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,140
and how do I get this to go as a thank

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,090
you all right all right screw that

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,340
picture all right so in the long long

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,990
ago there was a thing back when

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,159
dinosaurs roamed the earth called Red

35
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,560
Hat Linux some of you may be old enough

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,509
to remember this for those of you I'm

37
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,570
sorry but but reddit links was a thing

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,009
and then red-hot decided at some point

39
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,119
they didn't want to do Red Hat Linux

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,130
anymore they wanted to make money

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,319
because we weren't making any money we

42
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,729
were selling hats on making more money

43
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,500
than we were off of Red Hat Linux so for

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,850
all of you who bought a box copy of Red

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,440
Hat Linux you made us lose money thank

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,830
you and when I developed this all

47
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,920
entirely in-house it was all yes it was

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,090
open-source software but the work that

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,799
went into it was all done by people that

50
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:11,819
worked at Red Hat

51
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,440
so we would take Apache we bring it

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,000
in-house we put our patches on it we put

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,290
it in the right Linux we ship it out the

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,250
door and we'd support that but when we

55
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,720
stop doing right out Linux we thought we

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,250
still want to do something like Red Hat

57
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,540
Linux but we wanted to do it with the

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,980
community this is a picture of the

59
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,040
actual Fedora community and we wanted

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
them to be able to have a say on what

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,019
this gnu/linux looked like so this new

62
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,120
Linux got called Fedora and so we took

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,290
that out Linux and we put it in the

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,510
cocoon and we said it's going to become

65
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,130
something beautiful when it comes out of

66
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,600
the cocoon and it came out looking kind

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,840
of like this what eventually it looks

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,090
like this but for right now in the past

69
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,310
it looks like this so we have this thing

70
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,700
and we want the opportunity to let the

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,440
community decide what goes inside of it

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,720
and so we say to the community we'd say

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,160
okay you have a little more input into

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,989
what goes in and what doesn't go in what

75
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,880
color things are what patches are

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,079
applied to this we're going to give you

77
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,370
some free rein but we can't just give

78
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,430
you complete free rein so we created

79
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,140
this thing and no one's quite sure who

80
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,910
created this it is lost in the sands of

81
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,130
time but we created a tag in our

82
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,299
Bugzilla which is our bug tracking

83
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,880
system and we said this is fe legal fe

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,319
standing for fedora for some reason

85
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,700
legal standing for legal for obvious

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,440
reasons and if you aren't sure that

87
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,900
something should be in fedora or not you

88
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,900
ought to tag it f illegal and everyone

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,060
assumed that someone was looking at this

90
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,500
because when this was in-house everyone

91
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,170
was looking at this presumably and in

92
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,630
reality it's this lovely black hole with

93
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,010
a named Fe legal on top of it

94
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,300
and so at the time the photo op

95
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,830
logically der kind of asked around the

96
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,780
people and said hey so somebody should

97
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,670
probably look at this black hole and

98
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,780
figure out where all these things are

99
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,460
going and who's handling them and when

100
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,140
we figured out that no one was handling

101
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,500
them

102
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,110
I got volunteered to handle them so when

103
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,700
I started looking at these things and I

104
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,960
asked the legal department said what

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,660
should we do about these 175 open

106
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,370
tickets blocking a bugzilla thing that

107
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,510
no one has looked at since they were

108
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,250
ever filed during the creation of Fedora

109
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,370
and they said lawyers aren't you

110
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,600
supposed to be able to tell me what's

111
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,860
going on in this and they were like well

112
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,330
it's a community thing you could make

113
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,140
the rules and I was like really and then

114
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,579
we're like yeah you can and they're like

115
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,079
but but maybe you should run those rules

116
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,680
past us first all right so we're making

117
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,540
rules I said rule number one needs to be

118
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,460
free software we thought about making it

119
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,960
needs to be open-source but then

120
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,640
everything that was open-source was free

121
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,960
and some of the stuff that was open

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,340
source that was non free was kind of

123
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,720
sketchy and weird and so we were like

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,490
alright screw that free software we're

125
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,720
just gonna go with that and then people

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,070
were like that's an awesome idea and

127
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,470
then my internet doesn't work and we

128
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,750
were like huh well Wireless might be a

129
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,100
nice thing for people to have because of

130
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,780
the time pretty much every single

131
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,610
wireless chipset in existence except for

132
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,740
that one that was in like two laptops in

133
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,200
China needed firmware to be driven and

134
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,580
so we're like well we really don't want

135
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,990
to be that distribution that everyone

136
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,700
you see says we used to use that before

137
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,750
Wireless and and there was enough freeze

138
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,280
and freedom distributions that were out

139
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,450
there that didn't work on anybody's

140
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,800
wireless chipsets that we thought we

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,970
didn't need to add another one to that

142
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,770
collection so we made that sort of a

143
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,210
broad decision as a community that we

144
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,400
did want wireless support so we amended

145
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,390
this rule to say it need to be free

146
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,590
software except for firmware that's

147
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,630
needed to make free software work and

148
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,250
that has been one of those controversial

149
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,990
points in the history of fedora but the

150
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,700
fact that everyone on Fedora is using it

151
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,050
with wireless today means we probably

152
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,120
made the right call maybe someday in the

153
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
future we'll be able to say hey all

154
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,640
these wireless chipsets don't need this

155
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,020
firmware anymore and we can drop that

156
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,850
rule we'd be very happy to drop it we're

157
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,410
not big fans of it but that's the

158
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,370
biggest bone of contention between

159
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,460
fedora and the free supper foundation so

160
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,900
it's like I think this was the lawyer

161
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,100
showed up and said could we see it look

162
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,600
at that list of rules you're generating

163
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,890
and I said sure and they says it needs

164
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,729
to be something that we

165
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,830
actually distribute and I saw well what

166
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,240
about the community they're distributing

167
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,740
and then it taught me very clearly that

168
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,080
Red Hat is still the legal distributor

169
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,059
of this thing that the community made

170
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,650
the community stood around dumping

171
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,909
things in the pot and stirring it and

172
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,990
then they handed it to Red Hat and said

173
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,129
give it to the world and the Red Hat

174
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,539
says I will give it to the world and so

175
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,379
we had to make sure there wasn't like

176
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,389
dead bodies in there and stuff and

177
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,460
because Red Hat is an American Way

178
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,839
that's not the right picture for America

179
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,710
here we go because red is an American we

180
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,150
we we have to make sure that we actually

181
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,819
comply with US laws as crazy and wacky

182
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,389
and stupid as they are so compliant with

183
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,550
US laws this is things like you know say

184
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,669
the DMCA and yes the DMCA makes me want

185
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,289
to feel just like this on the inside and

186
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,370
know what makes everybody else feel like

187
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,259
this but we still have to comply with it

188
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,139
so all right so this is the rule has to

189
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,580
comply with laws this includes things

190
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,149
like patents so patents bad red hat lots

191
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,099
of money people come and say hey what's

192
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,270
your money red hat we would like that

193
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,379
and we'd like to not have to do anything

194
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:43,669
legitimate to get that money so we're

195
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,379
gonna see over patents that we found or

196
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,149
we bought or we made up and stuff like

197
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,800
that if you haven't looked through the

198
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,770
interesting case law data from the son

199
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,330
trial and which son admitted on the

200
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,249
stand that they had a team of employees

201
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,779
that were doing nothing other than

202
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,189
competing with each other to try to make

203
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,370
the worst patents they possibly could

204
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,610
yes

205
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,009
patents garbage but we have to step away

206
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:05,719
from that because no one's going to sue

207
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,580
Debian because if you sue Debian you

208
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,409
will get exactly zero dollars in return

209
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,879
and your lawyer will still have to get

210
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,809
paid whereas if you sue it out and you

211
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,069
win then there's some money in it for

212
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,449
you and red hat goes away and we're all

213
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:18,589
very sad about that because I don't have

214
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,490
a job so we need to not infringe known

215
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,379
red hat known patents now I'm not being

216
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,550
careful with the wording on this because

217
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,959
I don't want this to turn into a wool

218
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,279
spot said we're all good with this and

219
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,909
all that sort of stuff because I firmly

220
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,439
believe that there's a high probability

221
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,089
that everything we do including

222
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,689
breathing is infringing a patent and so

223
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,189
we have to be careful in the way that we

224
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,099
act such that we when we know something

225
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:44,599
is patented and I will give this

226
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,719
specific example mp3 when we knew P 3

227
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,209
was patented and they told us hey this

228
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,860
is patented this is the patent pool this

229
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,360
is how much it costs to join the patent

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,810
pool that we

231
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,980
well guess that's patented guess we

232
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,430
can't ship that now so the last thing we

233
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,750
did was we wanted to make sure the

234
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,770
lawyers were very interested in making

235
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,030
sure that we respected red-hats

236
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,639
trademarks we this was in the early for

237
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,260
a proto stage for fedora in which there

238
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,400
was still a lot of the community that

239
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,530
wanted to do things like take the Red

240
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,660
Hat logo and paint it blue and then say

241
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,340
that's the Fedora logo and people were

242
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,110
like no we can't do that that's not OK

243
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,720
and so we were thinking about this

244
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,310
process we decided that we wanted to go

245
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,930
a step beyond what we were obligated to

246
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,940
do by law in Fedora because if we want

247
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,440
people to respect the Red Hat on the

248
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,690
Fedora trademarks we really want to

249
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,150
respect all trademarks and yes it is the

250
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,560
burden of the trademark holder to come

251
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,150
and tell us hey stop putting Mario

252
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,669
themed games in your distribution we

253
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,900
decided to be easier just to have the

254
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,640
community say we're not going to let

255
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,679
these sorts of things in if it's a clear

256
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,299
trademark infringement or if you think

257
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,710
it might be trademark infringement ask

258
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,480
and we'll figure it out and we'll go

259
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,890
from there and the community has really

260
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,660
taken on that pretty well and we think

261
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,980
that that's made it more likely that

262
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,570
people who are willing to respect the

263
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,740
Fedora trademark now we start looking at

264
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,720
the bulk of these tickets in this black

265
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,890
hole and a lot of them were these

266
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,200
licensed tickets and what happened was

267
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,060
we inherited a lot of packages from Red

268
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,470
Hat Linux Red Hat Linux used to have

269
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,900
this thing called contribute this FTP

270
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,339
server where if you made a package you

271
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,690
could shove it in there and people would

272
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,920
be able to use it against Red Hat Linux

273
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,110
and so when the first thing when Fedora

274
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,580
sort of opened up a lot of people took

275
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,140
these old packages from contribute shove

276
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,250
them in there and said now they're in

277
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,570
fedora and we all like and we're happy

278
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,400
about this because you know as old

279
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,780
decisions like we're only gonna ship

280
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,980
send mail we're not gonna ship any other

281
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,140
smtp daemons and then a whole bunch of

282
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,520
these other smtp daemons showed up and

283
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,850
they had license tags like distributable

284
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,050
what does that mean how can I know if

285
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,280
that's compatible with something else

286
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,900
and so we started going through people

287
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,550
were like is distributable an actual

288
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,110
license tag we found one package in

289
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,339
fedora that said something like license

290
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,430
okay and we were like it looks good to

291
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,350
me well ship that so we had all these

292
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,030
licenses and so we had a list of what

293
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,380
this isn't actually the right picture

294
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,410
this is closer to the right picture the

295
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,520
number of licenses we started

296
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,990
discovering we started pulling back and

297
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,370
doing audits and sort of tearing into

298
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,420
this and this still didn't happen

299
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,550
overnight this happened over a long

300
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,779
window of time so we started generating

301
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,510
a list giving each one an identifier and

302
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,820
saying these all go in

303
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,770
at this point in time we have more than

304
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,960
350 free licenses that we're tracking in

305
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,180
this list including 16 BSD barians in 34

306
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,010
MIT very ins and quite frankly I found

307
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,690
about five more MIT variants but I can't

308
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,770
still make putting them in the list

309
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,970
anymore so I've stopped adding them so

310
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,230
so and then we started saying okay now

311
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,910
we've got this license list we've kicked

312
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,800
all the obvious garbage out we've got a

313
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,630
standardized way of marking things so

314
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,250
people don't write random garbage in the

315
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,860
license tag field on packages and the

316
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,030
Red Hat legal showed up and said you

317
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,590
need to have a CLA on this and we said

318
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,910
well we don't really know what you're

319
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,860
asking for but alright sure so we set up

320
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,150
a whole Fedora infrastructure for

321
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,350
contributing around this concept of

322
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,030
having a CLI and then I started noticing

323
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,100
as I was getting emailed to legal at

324
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,960
Fedora project org the people would be

325
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,160
like I don't understand what I just

326
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
agreed to and I'm not comfortable

327
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,100
agreeing to this I really want you to

328
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,530
explain this and what was happening was

329
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,910
we also started getting companies that

330
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,470
wanted to participate in fedora as it

331
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,700
started to be more successful and they

332
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,110
would say things like I'm not willing to

333
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,610
agree to these terms and I would say why

334
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,750
and they would say I'm not willing to

335
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,850
agree to these terms and it was not a

336
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,890
very productive arrangement there and

337
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,720
what finally we boiled down by asking a

338
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
whole bunch of people that weren't

339
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,730
willing to agree it's that most of them

340
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,810
thought it looked like a copyright

341
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,890
assignment which they were really

342
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,210
uncomfortable doing they didn't want to

343
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,560
give RedHat copyright because they knew

344
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,090
Red Hat made money they didn't know we

345
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,680
didn't make any money off fedora but the

346
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,090
thought was I gave you something cool

347
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,950
you put it in fedora you make a whole

348
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,940
bunch of money I'm making none of that

349
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,290
money because you gave me the copyright

350
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,030
and that wasn't what was ever intended

351
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,620
to do but enough people were confused by

352
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,430
this that we were like alright let's

353
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,710
redo this so we created the Fedora

354
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,180
project contributor agreement richard

355
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,700
fontana a big help with that and we

356
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,260
massively simplified the terms and we

357
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,210
said look the only thing we really care

358
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,490
about is to make sure that we have what

359
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,410
we get from our contributors under a

360
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,630
free license we don't even really care

361
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,130
what the free license is it can be

362
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,680
additive 350 on there but most of the

363
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
people who were making contributions

364
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,260
were doing it in small little corner

365
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,180
areas nothing too big nothing too large

366
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,410
but it was still copyrighted but we

367
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,210
still wanted to have a safety that just

368
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,740
in case somebody showed up and said hey

369
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,450
that spec file that I wrote for that

370
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,130
package ten years ago is now under a

371
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,600
proprietary license and you owe me money

372
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,140
and so we set it up such that basically

373
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,690
it says if you give us something and you

374
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,000
don't put a license on it you agree to

375
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,590
let us use it under a free license if

376
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,910
it's software you agree - let's use on

377
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,710
their MIT super permissive compatible

378
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,180
with everything if it's content you

379
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,170
agreed to let's use other Creative

380
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,670
Commons license compatible

381
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,350
with everything and everybody was like

382
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,300
that's cool I mean we even got sit down

383
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,560
to the point where we took this to the

384
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,060
federal government and the government

385
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,440
was like as long as you opt out all

386
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,760
federal government employees from having

387
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,470
to pretend they own copyright we're good

388
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,430
with it we're like all right we'll add

389
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,390
10 more lines of legalese to this so

390
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,130
that was where we got to and in the

391
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,540
course of the life of Fedora we've

392
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,680
accomplished a couple really interesting

393
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,900
things we were responsible fixing the

394
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,120
SGI freebie license making xorg finally

395
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
free one of the dirty little secrets of

396
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,600
xorg is that it had this giant chunk of

397
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,370
code inside of it that was non free and

398
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,660
everyone knew about it debian knew about

399
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,130
it gen 2 knew about it everybody knew

400
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,300
about it but everybody liked it we kind

401
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
of liked having graphics so we're gonna

402
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,650
keep going with this and we just finally

403
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,540
pushed through until they triggered the

404
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,890
clause in the freebie license the or

405
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,810
later clause and they said the MIT is

406
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,760
actually version 3 of the SGI freebie

407
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,830
until everybody triggered over to MIT

408
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,230
and all that went away we convinced son

409
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,210
to drop the nuclear clause for most of

410
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,500
their job of licensing making it

411
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,060
actually free because it had clauses

412
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,140
like you can't use this on a nuclear

413
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,700
submarine not that we really want to

414
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,320
choke on a nuclear submarine to start

415
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,110
rather really but and then we realized

416
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,580
since most of the artistic one only

417
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,710
modules in Sipan and drop from fedora

418
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,850
what we couldn't fix which was about

419
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,680
five most of the vast majority of them

420
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
were like oh that license isn't what you

421
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,340
like we'll move to the new one or we'll

422
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,630
just move to the same licenses of the

423
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,270
rest of pearl and so that you know six

424
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,200
months of my life I'll never get back

425
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,680
but we got a lot of that done we also

426
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,570
work with tech live to identify and

427
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,070
remove all the non free components a

428
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,140
tech live is like an onion that you keep

429
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,610
peeling back layers you keep peeling

430
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,990
back and keep peeling back and keep

431
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,300
peeling back and there's a guy from 1983

432
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,800
living inside there and he's like could

433
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,010
you put those back I'm in here so we

434
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,630
went through and identified all the non

435
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,070
free components inside tech lab which

436
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,350
took forever and then an upstream I had

437
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,030
this great email in my archives this

438
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,620
basically is one of the head maintainer

439
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,820
to the time from tech live and he said

440
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,770
do I really have to get rid of these

441
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,660
things yes you really have to get rid of

442
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,050
these things so you're welcome

443
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,150
we also helped a lot of smaller projects

444
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,560
to resolve licensing issues people

445
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,150
started to recognize that hey fedora is

446
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,230
not messing around with this license

447
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,490
stuff and they started coming to us and

448
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,380
saying I wrote this new license and I

449
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,760
think it might be and I'll be like stop

450
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,310
don't do that and we got a lot of those

451
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,510
fixed we work with them to resolve

452
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,750
compatibility issues and we also fix a

453
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,220
lot of fonts there was a lot of fonts

454
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,120
that were out there that were in common

455
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,370
use that were just not on

456
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,900
licences in a lot of times we were the

457
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,250
first people who had ever asked this

458
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,839
font author hey is there any chance

459
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,800
you'd be willing to put this under a

460
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,570
free license and he was like oh that

461
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,130
matters to you okay sure whatever and we

462
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,660
and this was just a like debian and kick

463
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
half the fonts out at one point and we

464
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,750
just went there and asked every single

465
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,529
one of them and they were like sure

466
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,440
whatever so and then we also centralized

467
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,910
the Fedora trademarks in one package we

468
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,110
knew that people wanted to be able to

469
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,850
take Fedora and rebrand it and REE spin

470
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,260
it and do all sorts of stuff with it so

471
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,220
we said all right fine let's make it

472
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,450
easy for people to do that if that's

473
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,650
what they really want let's make their

474
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,330
lives easy so we took all the Fedora

475
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,010
trademarks we got rid of all the Red Hat

476
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,690
trademarks and we put them all in one

477
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,010
package and said hey you delete this

478
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,960
package we even made a package that

479
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,120
replaces this one that has no trademarks

480
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,830
in it and it was originally intended

481
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,570
like a template but people were like hey

482
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,190
now I have generic Linux and we're like

483
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,210
okay

484
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,500
generic lending saying and that's what

485
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,650
you wanted so here it brings us to the

486
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,430
present so these locks represent

487
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,870
photography and because I couldn't have

488
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,680
anything else better up sign

489
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,990
cryptography but we spent a lot of time

490
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,490
trying to get ECC back into fedora

491
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,690
because we know a lot of you don't like

492
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,700
the NSA reading your email and we

493
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,290
thought it would be nice if we covered

494
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,730
as much as we could and so this is a

495
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,680
long drawn-out process to determine when

496
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,580
the Red Hat legal team would be

497
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,680
comfortable with this going in the net

498
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,150
result is today in fedora we have all

499
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,310
the curves and Suite B plus SEC P 521

500
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,459
our one 256 K 1 which is the Bitcoin

501
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,890
curve the IDI two five five one nine

502
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,970
curve which was never encumbered by

503
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,680
anything just nobody ever asked about it

504
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,650
and then this p224

505
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,640
this took six years for the base

506
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,080
functionality to come in and ten for all

507
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,430
the curves so it's one of those things

508
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,660
where just having to convince people

509
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,279
that yes these things are not as risky

510
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,930
as you think they might be and then some

511
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,250
things happen in those space that made

512
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,870
them less risky over time but needless

513
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,330
to say Fedora has DCC now so that's a

514
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,670
better thing for us and in music

515
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,860
musics another big thing people have

516
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,570
been asking us why don't we have mp3 for

517
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,950
years it was because it was obviously

518
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,480
patented the patent holder was making a

519
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,980
lot of noise about charging everybody

520
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,029
for patents they were raiding

521
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,680
conferences and stealing mp3 players

522
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,060
that hadn't paid for the patent licenses

523
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,640
so we finally were able to enable

524
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,260
decoding functionality because enough of

525
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,800
the patents in that pool expired and

526
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,820
encoding is still legally problematic

527
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,050
because they're still on expired patents

528
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,520
in that space I can say all of these

529
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,690
things because they have a very public

530
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,430
very obvious patent pool you can go on

531
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,510
their website and see exactly which

532
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,010
patents are still alive the Red Hat

533
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,630
desktop team did a lot of the work on

534
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,160
this too it's one of those projects

535
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,700
where we've been tracking it on and off

536
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,230
ever since they told us to take mp3 out

537
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,510
fun fact I've let dates in my calendar

538
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,950
for when patents expire and it's

539
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,240
triggers a little alarms and so some

540
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,530
days all wake up and a patent be expire

541
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,820
like it's gonna be a good day we can add

542
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,060
something to fedora so people always ask

543
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,040
me what's coming in the future so

544
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,030
there's a couple things I'm coming and

545
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,210
hoping you see in the future s 3tc yeah

546
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,770
that patent that makes it so that when

547
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,360
you try to install steam on Fedora and

548
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,560
it installs all happy and then under

549
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,380
your games worked s3 t C so that ik

550
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,150
patent expires on October 2nd and so

551
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,410
that's another alarm on my calendar

552
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,810
super pumped about MPEG 1 video we're

553
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,980
investigating that see if that's

554
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,140
possibility because that is old old old

555
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,760
and we think there's a very low

556
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,990
likelihood there's anything still

557
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,459
infringing in that space and because I'm

558
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,839
taking one video and I think to audio so

559
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,920
closely tied together we think we're

560
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,359
probably able to get both of them at the

561
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,589
same time G 729 audio is Telecom codec

562
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,130
they earlier this week the patent pool

563
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,720
holder released a statement saying that

564
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,760
enough for the patents that expired that

565
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,080
any patents that were still in the space

566
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,060
they weren't sure even existed but that

567
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,050
they were releasing the rest of them

568
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,880
under a royalty-free license and so we

569
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,900
should be able to get that in and

570
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,250
cleanly but again all these things have

571
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,450
to go through proper processes so I

572
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,230
can't just go and just commit SP DX

573
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,970
Fedora's been talking about that for a

574
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,520
while upstream adoption is vital for the

575
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,780
full chain and Trust for the XP DX

576
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,240
complete that's not happening yet and

577
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,070
we'd love to see that happening but in

578
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,320
happening yet so we support you good

579
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,730
work keep it up we would love to be

580
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,980
there but we're considering the value of

581
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,690
adopting the SPX license identifiers in

582
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,100
the fedora packaging metadata a couple

583
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,060
of other distributions have already done

584
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,310
that the biggest problem for us is that

585
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,050
we have so many BSD and MIT variants and

586
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,490
this is gonna make it really hard for us

587
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,720
to go through we're gonna have to do a

588
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,210
package by package file by file audit of

589
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,620
every single thing in fedora to make

590
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,470
that accomplished and quite frankly this

591
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,520
is why I drink so that's a whole bunch

592
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
of Fedora legal history past the present

593
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,220
and this tiny little presentation are

594
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,300
there any questions about anything I can

595
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,740
answer about fedora for you I'm happy to

596
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:39,890
take them now so many things alright if

597
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,060
you have any further or legal questions

598
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,650
I can be found at legal at for the road

599
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,270
project org you feel free to send me I

600
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,010
will not help you with your divorce but

601
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,160
other than that I would be

602
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,290
we must have a cross yes I knew there

603
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:56,820
was a question yes this is not courtier

604
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,350
your presentation but do you have a

605
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,970
shared copy of your patent ax precal

606
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,740
endure that you that you publicly keep

607
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,760
you're not the first person to have

608
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,370
asked that question I asked I asked Red

609
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,870
Hat at one point about that they were

610
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,060
like don't you do that oh that's a bad

611
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,840
idea

612
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,810
so it's oh no sorry all right thank you

613
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,970
all right thank you enjoy posture did

614

you do much

615

[Applause]
