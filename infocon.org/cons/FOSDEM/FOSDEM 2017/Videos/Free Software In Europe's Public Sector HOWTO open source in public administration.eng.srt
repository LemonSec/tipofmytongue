1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,179
or

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,630
being here I have 40 minutes I hope to

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,129
have some time for questions for you

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:19,140
guys as well I'll try and talk in say

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
3035 minutes I'll give you an overview

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,539
of free and open source software in

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,859
public administrations in Europe I've

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,990
been writing for a project at the

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,549
European Commission for 10 years so the

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,320
main thing I'll try and do here is give

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,860
you a set of tips a set of things that

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,320
public administrations need to do as a

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,120
set of things that we can check whether

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,440
public administrations have them in

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,140
place that will make them slowly switch

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,950
to open source a few disclaimers I am an

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,660
external contractor I'm just a

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,430
journalist I happened to be in the lucky

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,390
position to work for the European

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,920
Commission I am NOT the European

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,050
Commission so the things I say here are

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,930
my view not the Commission's view and

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,030
when I talk about free software I mean

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,530
open source and when I say open source I

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,119
mean free software for me as a person

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,150
it's more or less synonymous so when you

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,760
see it behind me on the screen go either

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,880
way

29
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,340
this talk has six chapters I'll give you

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,830
as I announced the that yes

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,960
we'll need a bigger Beemer this is as

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,830
big as it gets

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:46,320
sorry you can control in the plus button

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,480
once as long as I don't use my lose my

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,860
notes better again can we have your

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:07,330
votes again so I'll give you the the

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,419
main things that I see that are

38
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,040
requirements for public administrations

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,130
I will quickly this is the desktop

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,480
development room I'll quickly run

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,140
through the main desktop implementations

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,420
that we have in Europe I will give you

43
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,290
the key policies I will talk briefly

44
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,180
about what are the expected benefits

45
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,040
when public administrations go to open

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,070
source one of the things that worries me

47
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,300
is the point that's called what's

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,620
missing because there's a few things

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,780
missing but I first need to talk about

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,200
the OSHA project but so just to bear

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,520
with me for five seconds I'll show you

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,150
how it works this is the how-to these

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,500
are the main implementations the key

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,510
policies the expected benefits and

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,950
what's missing some of these slides go

56
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,310
deep so that's what happens here

57
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,190
so first the open source Observatory we

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,519
have more than 2000 news items we have

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,010
case studies we have best practices we

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,840
have how to's the project tries to cover

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,870
any public administration that uses open

62
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,610
source that implements open source is

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,010
thinking about doing this or is

64
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,739
considering to stop doing it we bring a

65
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,930
lot of positive news because the trend

66
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,000
is public administration's are going to

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
open source but every now and then it

68
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,470
goes wrong so we report about that as

69
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,480
well

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,940
it's the open source Observatory and

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,370
repository so we have a catalogue of

72
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,530
solutions made for and by public

73
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,860
administrations there some 4000 of them

74
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,080
that's also but it's not all done at the

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,140
Commission level that we link

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,340
repositories in the Member States

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,140
there's a whole bunch of them like 12 in

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,000
Spain there's a bunch in there's one or

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
two in Austria we have one in the

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,930
Netherlands there's one in Belgium when

81
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,790
you search for solutions on the ozone

82
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,500
you will find the solutions in the

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,150
Austrian and the Spanish repositories

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,519
and vice-versa and the collection of

85
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,209
these tools and all of this is for

86
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,160
chronic identification or for electronic

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,930
procurement anything to do with a

88
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,899
government those solutions are being

89
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,738
built increasingly as open-source it's

90
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,060
you will hardly come across the public

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,800
administration that these days is no

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,070
longer developing tools as proprietary

93
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,400
that the hardly ever happens something

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,680
that we're very proud of or happy that

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,660
we have done it is developed the EU PL

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,039
it's sort of a fork of the GPL why was

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,260
that necessary the Commission has a

98
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,850
principle that all of the software that

99
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,979
the Commission now publishes is done as

100
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,470
open-source a whole bunch of lawyers

101
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,780
looked at the GPL and sort of feared

102
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,810
that if the EC would do this and there

103
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,430
was some kind of problem somewhere down

104
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,750
the line they would have to fly to the

105
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,139
US to argue in the US courts something

106
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,330
about European made software that they

107
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,910
didn't want to do so that's one big

108
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,460
reason that they use the GPL and change

109
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,570
the bunch of things so that they could

110
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,340
say you go to a court in one of the

111
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,660
Member States and if that doesn't work

112
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,340
you can go to a court in Brussels in

113
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,789
Belgium so that was one reason another

114
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,220
thing that is I think personally really

115
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,520
cool is that they did this license in

116
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,070
all the languages of the European Union

117
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,150
that's 23 if I'm not mistaken that means

118
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,950
that you can use as a German developer

119
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,669
the German EU PL and it's legally the

120
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,669
same as the Dutch or the French or the

121
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,389
Maltese or the Greek so that makes

122
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,889
working together as public a message is

123
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,690
a lot simpler so

124
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,780
some a little bit of context the the

125
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,570
odor is part of the is one of the small

126
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,940
programs of the ISO square program I

127
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,100
don't I wouldn't want to bother you with

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,590
the details but the Commission has a

129
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,000
bunch of ministries one of them is the

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,700
Ministry for IT it's called DG IT digit

131
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,710
they have a program that looks at the

132
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,430
Member States

133
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,840
DG IT is concerned with rolling out

134
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,460
software for the workstations and the

135
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,470
services in the Commission itself but

136
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,960
the eisah program is more or less the

137
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,950
only program that looks at all the

138
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,419
Member States and tries to get them

139
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,760
together to work on solutions to share

140
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,270
and reuse and in this sharing and reuse

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,430
program they figured we need open-source

142
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,350
is a very easy way to get that done and

143
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,590
that's where also comes in its support -

144
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,750
for that goal as I promised I will this

145
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,669
is for me it's the main part of the

146
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,240
presentation how to fix open source so

147
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,250
that how to fix public administration so

148
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,660
that they do open source so the first

149
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,950
thing we need to do is to make free and

150
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,470
open source software a task for the head

151
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,479
of IT for the head of the department for

152
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,520
the head of the IT department or the CIO

153
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,320
at the ministry level or the

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,740
municipality level or for the decision

155
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,880
maker at the national level I've listed

156
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,950
three of the main advantages that if a

157
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,840
CEO these days does not have an

158
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,840
open-source strategy you would be you

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
should be able to tell him that he has

160
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
sort of he doesn't know what he's doing

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,630
because you really need to have an

162
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,850
answer to open-source as a decision

163
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,270
maker and IT these days the license

164
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,210
costs I will maybe touch on this later I

165
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,580
just that's just the tip of the iceberg

166
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,530
you're looking at scalability you're

167
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,800
looking at flexibility you're looking at

168
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
the velocity of innovation in your

169
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,100
organization that's what open source is

170
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,630
doing that's what public address fascias

171
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,490
across the EU are discovering there's

172
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,460
like tons of examples of this and so

173
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,740
it's good for a CEO for a decision-maker

174
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,560
to have a policy in place to say we're

175
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,150
currently not using it a lot

176
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,220
we're using it in the servers we're

177
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,490
using it in our data warehouses but we

178
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,530
should be using it across the stack so

179
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,880
this is where we are and this is where

180
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
we need to go like the EC they have a

181
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,729
policy like that they say let's say the

182
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,940
back off is a lot of open source at the

183
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,150
workstations some open source the target

184
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,850
is we should move to more open source

185
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,210
across the stack that's the policy and

186
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,339
then they can start disrupting parts of

187
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,559
the infrastructure say that's too much

188
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,809
proprietary we need to you know roll out

189
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:46,520
a switch program one of the main

190
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,680
strategic goals for CEO the last one is

191
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,529
a is basically a quote from Lea Maxwell

192
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,839
a few years ago the CEO for the UK

193
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,350
government it's taking control and get

194
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,470
rid of locking it's a main thing well as

195
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,779
I said there's tons of examples I've

196
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,980
arranged them here at levels of

197
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,850
government so you have the national

198
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,560
government the United Kingdom's the

199
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,740
digital services they have an

200
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,820
open-source lead she is looking at

201
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,020
currently she announced recently she's

202
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,700
looking at all the big applications out

203
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,680
there which are already developed under

204
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
an open-source license which is not the

205
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,800
same as saying you do them as

206
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,380
open-source because that would require

207
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,080
support and a road map and a community

208
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,120
and engagements with his community so

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,589
she's trying to fix that part of the

210
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,150
strategy in France you have a CIO who

211
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,820
has a big government modernization unit

212
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,380
dongsik they have a very good very solid

213
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,170
very well thought through policy on

214
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,020
openness which includes a lot of open

215
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,470
source of course

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,250
at a multi municipality there's a lot of

217
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,020
municipalities across Europe that

218
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,210
realize that they're doing the same as

219
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,890
their neighbor and they could be using

220
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,240
the same tools as the neighbor and

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,340
they're starting to work together I've

222
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,290
listed a few examples in Denmark you

223
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,210
have os/2 I think that has now 60% of

224
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,060
all municipalities and they are pooling

225
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,770
their budgets and it's making it a lot

226
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,780
cheaper and they're using a lot of

227
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,270
Drupal based web-based solutions and

228
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,320
they're rolling out fast and they will

229
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,820
pretty soon have maybe all of the

230
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,950
municipalities and their model is

231
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,620
challenging the traditional model of the

232
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,230
proprietary vendors and the proprietary

233
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,790
central sort of proprietary

234
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,950
decentralized government department

235
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,290
because here all of a sudden you see

236
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,520
municipalities working together solving

237
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,800
IT issues which actually solve public

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,020
administration issues and it goes much

239
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,820
faster than the central government

240
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,590
department that tries to bring this

241
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,280
top-down can-do Norway we have the

242
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,740
Kongsberg region near Oslo where they

243
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,440
are doing a lot of web-based services

244
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,080
that increasingly other municipalities

245
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,100
can use so its helpdesk its training its

246
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,580
calendaring and other solutions that

247
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,050
they host in their cloud and other

248
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,240
municipalities can say oh we have that

249
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,680
as well we need that as well here's a

250
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,210
bit of our IT budget because we would

251
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,800
like that feature to be implemented and

252
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,090
the group as a whole

253
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,200
starts fixing it Belgium a great example

254
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
email it has about 200 municipalities in

255
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,830
the french-speaking parts of Belgium

256
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,470
they're all working together on Python

257
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,700
and zopi based based solutions that's

258
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,010
like really great it's huge to go to

259
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,770
somebody at the municipality itself of

260
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,590
course Munich I will not have to talk

261
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,120
long about many here it's work world

262
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,820
famous a region

263
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,160
there's loads of regions in France or

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,630
several regions that do a lot on

265
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,270
open-source I just pointed out here the

266
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,780
Basque region by the way the slides are

267
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,520
already online and all these blue words

268
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,070
are links to directly to the author that

269
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,510
will show you the article where this is

270
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,170
based on the bus has a free

271
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,520
software policy they want to

272
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,650
do free software everywhere in the whole

273
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,320
stack for everything a bunch of years

274
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,080
ago the country the autonomous region

275
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,670
realized it was going to run out of

276
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,070
money and it gave their it gave their

277
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,920
staff the choice either we do something

278
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,060
about RIT because it's really expensive

279
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,160
or we start firing a bunch of people

280
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,130
watch which would you prefer so they

281
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,590
chose for the software but that maybe

282
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,740
makes sense and at an organizational

283
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,610
level

284
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,040
the Ministry of Finland I don't think

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,460
it's it's a very interesting for me very

286
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,870
important case but I think they've

287
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,480
rolled back they actually came back on

288
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,620
their decision but the bunch of years

289
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,350
ago ten years ago five years ago they

290
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,690
did a comparative study between

291
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,050
OpenOffice Microsoft Office and IBM

292
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,980
notes office or IBM office they ran the

293
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,350
cost comparison

294
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,570
they concluded that IBM would be the

295
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,370
cheapest they chose for OpenOffice

296
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,350
rolled it out and why why did they do

297
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,030
that why is this an interesting case

298
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,040
because they realized the free software

299
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,530
license gives you scalability and and it

300
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,080
gives you freedom to experiment that

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,970
they already were able to implement it

302
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,580
in a pilot program and it ran so well

303
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,380
and it implemented so easily and it was

304
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,540
maintainable so easily that before they

305
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,120
kind of made the decision process run

306
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,170
through the process they had already

307
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,350
installed it in the whole ministry and

308
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,790
that was something that they had never

309
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,470
experienced before and they liked it so

310
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,720
much that that's why they even though it

311
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,550
was maybe a bit more expensive than IBM

312
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,050
they they went for it

313
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,470
the CIO of the ministry did its PhD

314
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,220
thesis on this and they'll come back on

315
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,290
that because he made a few

316
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,810
recommendations that are in here the

317
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,440
second big thing that we need to do is

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,450
this is strange because you know I go

319
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,210
from CIO all of a sudden to a tool but

320
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,520
there is no real order in the sequence

321
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,620
we have to make Mozilla Firefox the

322
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,130
default browser

323
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,990
it's a complete open source browser at M

324
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,260
you a lot of governments are looked in

325
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,170
or maybe I should say we're locked in in

326
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,990
Internet Explorer they might be moving

327
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,610
away a lot of them are actually using

328
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,230
both Firefox and Internet Explorer

329
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,670
Internet Explorer is maybe on its way

330
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,350
out but it's still very dominant in

331
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,720
public administrations and it's not only

332
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,900
a way for a proprietary browser vendor

333
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,360
and operating system vendor and office

334
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,950
solutions vendor to lock in the public

335
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,540
administration but you have a lot of

336
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,670
service providers that say our solution

337
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,350
requires ie and it therefore they

338
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,470
piggyback on the lock-in and they can

339
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,550
keep milking the public administration

340
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,210
if they if they believe that they they

341
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,050
need to require ie so we need to force

342
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,310
public administrations to say Firefox is

343
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,110
the browser everything that has to work

344
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,220
through the web has to work through

345
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,240
Firefox Mozilla is also very active on

346
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,930
the open standards front and this will

347
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,440
be a way to reward that as I mentioned

348
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,350
it breaks the lock into ie a breaks lock

349
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,870
into a lot of proprietary technology an

350
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,810
anecdote would be a small Dutch town

351
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,460
that decided that this is what they

352
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,470
would do and they started the go shading

353
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,390
with all of their vendors saying okay we

354
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,580
have this web-based - we have that web

355
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,480
base - if you do not support Firefox we

356
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,910
will move to a different vendor and all

357
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,950
of the vendors started tooling around

358
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,810
there so far so that it would speak the

359
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,710
same things in Firefox it's available in

360
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,390
all operating systems so then you have

361
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,400
the freedom to say you want to use a Mac

362
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,780
go ahead use a Mac you want to use an

363
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,490
expectation go ahead use a Linux host

364
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,250
and that's what we need to do there's

365
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,310
tons of examples and sorry my notes are

366
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,840
not here so I'm going to miss a few

367
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,320
things so I remember that quite well the

368
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,700
Supreme Court of Slovenia it's a very

369
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,370
interesting example this is the main

370
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,340
court of the country they have people in

371
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,260
place that understand very well how this

372
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,910
thing works how lock-in works how

373
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,100
competition works and how the legal

374
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,290
system works and so they rolled out they

375
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,339
have complete open source workstations a

376
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,279
lot of them the country however that

377
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,870
this project is in trouble because the

378
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,209
minister that is doing public

379
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,639
administration is in the US every like

380
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,470
month every other other week and he

381
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,000
speaks to all the big vendors and then

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,620
they gave him a reward and they give him

383
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,110
a you know a medal and then they and he

384
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,190
comes back and he says Oh Cisco this or

385
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,069
HP that and it makes problems for public

386
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,250
administrations that that try to do the

387
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,699
right thing the ministry also realizes

388
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,419
that he is a small country and like one

389
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,910
of these big American firms makes more

390
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,740
money than the entire country they can

391
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,189
buy Slovenia main the biggest European

392
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,959
of the biggest European examples of the

393
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,280
French and armory I will not talk about

394
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,040
it long cuz I'll come back on it later

395
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,140
interesting is let's see which one here

396
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,260
interesting Aarhus in Denmark R which is

397
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,809
the second largest town of Denmark and

398
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,669
they are one of the main drivers behind

399
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,500
the O is too weird I mentioned a few

400
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,830
slides ago and so their policy for

401
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,049
Firefox is interesting Arnhem is

402
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,809
interesting because it had a huge fine

403
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,850
they had a pilot project that was going

404
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,469
to to figure out an open-source switch

405
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,299
Microsoft heard about this install the

406
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,799
network sniffer a license network

407
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,760
sniffer in the network

408
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,409
and the fine was in the millions and it

409
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,250
it rubbed the city of its of its

410
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,710
financial power to do the pilot so that

411
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,559
died the what is interesting in our

412
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,480
enemies that the councillor has a PhD in

413
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,220
computer science this whole house runs

414
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,610
on Debian so I hope that he will

415
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,679
continue to try this the bus country I

416
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,270
already mentioned

417
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,140
Munich is very famous and so in line

418
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,780
with making Mozilla the default browser

419
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,230
this is why open standards have to

420
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,740
become mandatory so this is very tricky

421
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,210
because you know now we have a debate

422
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,100
about what is open what is an open

423
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,090
standard and what's the definition so I

424
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,380
don't think I will do it here but we

425
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,570
need to be mindful of their definition

426
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,160
what can I say what what I would find

427
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,530
practical is that we should say that a

428
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,810
standard that is open it needs to be it

429
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,030
needs to be implementable in open-source

430
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,060
software that would make it open we

431
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,770
could require that the NOPA standard can

432
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,630
only be put on an open standards list by

433
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,210
any government by saying it needs to be

434
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,360
implemented actively implemented in an

435
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,580
open-source tool that would that would

436
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,840
bring threshold that some of the full

437
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,670
open standards are occurring out there

438
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,880
wouldn't be able to jump Oh XML is the

439
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,590
best example I think it's a standard

440
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,200
that we should not have allowed in i0 it

441
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,940
should be taken out of either that's my

442
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,240
personal opinion

443
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,520
but it's that use fake open standards

444
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
are making it really difficult for those

445
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,600
that try to use open standards that's

446
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,620
what we see in also time and time again

447
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,940
European Commission is one of its it's

448
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,860
here is a problem by itself because it

449
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,960
publishes a lot of documents and they

450
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,000
don't really understand at the right

451
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,970
level the importance of this document

452
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,370
format we keep telling them and

453
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,570
eventually we'll get through to the

454
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,130
right persons but they keep publishing

455
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,800
it in this non open centre that is

456
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,390
called an open Center which is not an

457
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,070
open Senate and it's making it really

458
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,870
painful for all those that are trying to

459
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,140
use our EF so you need to take care of

460
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,670
the selection process if you want to

461
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,540
know all the details

462
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,560
please look at Sweden they have figured

463
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,360
this out they have first they took the

464
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,250
Dutch list and the Dutch already made a

465
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,760
nice selection then the suite says ok so

466
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,500
we have to desist we need to make sure

467
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,230
that these are really open and so they

468
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,570
had to scientists Pierre Mendell and its

469
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,080
colleague

470
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,680
think

471
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,930
about so how what what does that mean

472
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,640
that means you need the community and

473
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,140
your needs to be an open process it

474
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,670
needs to be low threshold that everybody

475
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,770
should be able to pitch in now let's

476
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,510
look at this Dutch list and see which of

477
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,060
those actually have a community which

478
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,580
are actually made without financial

479
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,950
thresholds and then they read it down a

480
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,330
little list so it became a little bit

481
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,700
smaller that is a good list to start

482
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
with and you need to walk your talk I

483
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,810
already mentioned the Commission it says

484
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,700
it wants to do open standards it

485
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,860
believes strongly that open standards

486
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,440
will fix the lock-in and now we need to

487
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,210
get the Commission to commit to its own

488
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,010
statements and actually walk its talk

489
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,490
examples I a great example is the UK

490
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,350
they have a fantastically well thought

491
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,970
through open silence policy which is

492
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,950
really driving change in Great Britain

493
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,520
we it's hard to say that the effects are

494
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,990
already visible but they will become

495
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,220
very visible very soon

496
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,340
you I keep asking the GDS to send me

497
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,720
concrete examples and and that's slow

498
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,330
but it will come France already

499
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,100
mentioned a few slides ago also have a

500
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,560
very well thought through openness

501
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,960
policy open source sorry open standards

502
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,250
is a big part of that they have recently

503
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,280
published the RTI which is their list of

504
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
open standards which in in the first

505
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,140
version the first draft version had only

506
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,150
ODF and not oxm L there was a bit of

507
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,220
pressure not from the proprietary vendor

508
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,750
itself but from the public

509
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,880
administration's that are using this

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,510
fake open Center and so they put it back

511
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,580
on in the published version but they

512
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,510
said warning this standards has a lot of

513
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,670
proprietary links it's very unclear it's

514
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,560
very difficult we should you can only

515
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,170
use it for Excel and you can only use it

516
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,790
if there is no way you can you can

517
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,430
escape in your in whatever you did in

518
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,860
your excel sheet that you cannot use ODF

519
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,550
otherwise you should use ODF the

520
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,290
Netherlands I already touched on it they

521
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,160
have a good list to have a

522
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,290
standardization forum standardization

523
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,700
board that is also trying to drive

524
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,820
change the Dutch IT policy when you talk

525
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,539
about

526
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,210
this topic free and open source they say

527
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,239
look open standards are the thing that

528
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,649
is what we're going to implement all

529
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,019
over our public conversation and then

530
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,059
the change should come by itself to open

531
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,619
source because it's just the best way to

532
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,249
implement open source open standards

533
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,409
Sweden I mentioned the list and the

534
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,929
European Commission if you want to study

535
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,779
this more in detail they have the

536
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,489
sharing or use framework which is where

537
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:23,359
OHS are fitting and where open standards

538
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,429
are defined or we're trying to define a

539
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,739
per sentence we have the EIF where there

540
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,229
is an interesting debate about how to

541
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:32,029
define this thing that's where it takes

542
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,220
place and we have the cans which is a

543
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,529
monitoring process that will show you

544
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,080
which countries have which standards but

545
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,519
so there you can just pick out it for

546
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,519
example you will see the ODF is

547
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,200
basically in almost all Member States

548
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,889
and docx or XML is in a few like five or

549
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:53,210
six that's interesting the fourth main

550
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,499
thing we need to do we as groups that

551
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,179
are interested in this process or they

552
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,279
as public administration's is help the

553
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,320
organization change yeah it's it's like

554
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,549
this you have a proprietary workstation

555
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,960
income the open source people they take

556
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,149
away your proprietary workstation put in

557
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,679
place a taboo to workstation belieber

558
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,960
office and there you go for a public

559
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,940
administrator they don't understand what

560
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,429
we're doing because they say you replace

561
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,229
the stack with something that was

562
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,080
exactly the same why did you do that and

563
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,489
and then you have all the other problems

564
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:30,169
that the button isn't there like the

565
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,299
printer won't work and the telephone is

566
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,769
not connected and my calendar doesn't

567
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,029
think that you have all the little

568
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,059
technical things but they don't get why

569
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,239
we're replacing one stack for another we

570
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:45,120
need to communicate

571
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,669
the best way to drive this change is to

572
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,440
do really small-scale pilots and

573
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,059
convince the key people in those

574
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,559
organizations why this change is

575
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,240
important so that they can talk to their

576
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,379
colleagues when their colleagues are

577
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,629
like that's not working they can say

578
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,850
look it is working you just have to you

579
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,090
know click the other icon or fix it for

580
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,129
them

581
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:12,659
and communication is the key aspect you

582
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,159
need to talk and talk and talk and talk

583
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
and talk there now Regent PhD thesis on

584
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
the Ministry of Justice that was his

585
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,100
main conclusion you need in every

586
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,409
organisation what he called a innovation

587
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:24,210
champion somebody who can talk and

588
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,600
convince and fix and do and he will go

589
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,950
to your desktop and he will fix it on

590
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,149
the spot that he will go to the other

591
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,129
desktop and explain it to you 10 times

592
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,809
if necessary and he will convince

593
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,999
everybody in the organization why this

594
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:41,360
is a good thing communication is key

595
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,129
tons of examples both on the good side

596
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:47,399
and the bad side good for me update at

597
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,970
this moment the greatest example is not

598
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,429
Eric Fisher is the IT manager that has

599
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,700
set up the change amount he is the

600
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,990
change manager and he has been

601
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,490
publishing a lot and he's been talking

602
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,950
on conferences such as this one about

603
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,159
how to do this change justice ministry I

604
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:12,330
just ran ahead of myself clearly what is

605
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,789
an interesting example it's a good thing

606
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,379
here that my notes aren't clear the term

607
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:17,759
notes are invisible and after me for

608
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,850
memory the city of Munich they also

609
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,749
understood the importance of change and

610
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,490
they did the entire desktop as we all

611
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,169
know they had a whole bunch of things

612
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,210
they did newsletters leaflets brochures

613
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,759
workshops conferences for their staff to

614
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,940
convince them explain them they did

615
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,889
awards for you know make the best

616
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,990
picture of Munich and the best three

617
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,409
pictures will be the desktop def default

618
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:47,940
desktop images that you can choose from

619
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,309
when you start your Linux workstation

620
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,860
and that was this sounds cool to get

621
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,480
people involved in making pictures of

622
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,340
Munich but it was also a way for the IT

623
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,899
department to control the desktop

624
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:58,830
pictures

625
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,480
and there are plenty of reasons that you

626
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,700
want to control your desktop pictures to

627
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,110
make sure it's professional because not

628
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,450
all the staff will choose a professional

629
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,850
picture the defense ministry in in Italy

630
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,730
it's currently the largest European

631
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,130
maybe globally the largest rollout of

632
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,280
Libre Office on the desktop they use the

633
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,150
document foundation change management

634
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,630
manual and it that's a pretty it's at

635
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,890
the bottom it's a pretty good document

636
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,140
people should you organization should

637
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,510
use it as a template to consider okay

638
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,950
this might not entirely fit my

639
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,360
organization but these are the things I

640
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,670
need to do on the bad side the city of

641
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,450
Eden they had it's a Dutch town they had

642
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,850
it rolled out they were going to do the

643
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,730
whole stack they had everything on open

644
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,590
standards they had somebody convert all

645
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,240
their proprietary document formats to

646
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,280
ODF and now they're rolling it all back

647
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,930
what's the reason yeah I teach your IT

648
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,990
manager changed that in came a new IT

649
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,730
manager who had a whole bunch of things

650
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,990
that he needed to do and then he had all

651
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,580
these resistance in the desktops because

652
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,500
people were angry because I just

653
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,520
explained you have the desktop you

654
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,680
changed everything nothing works people

655
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,740
were frustrated he blames of course the

656
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,030
open source tools he doesn't blame the

657
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,160
change process and the easiest way to

658
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,080
get around this is but which is roll off

659
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,820
everything back and he calls his friends

660
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,160
and that's just the usual way to do

661
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
these things and I try to get in touch

662
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,440
with these people to figure out what is

663
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,970
wrong and then you you you just call

664
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,440
somebody in the in the city hall and

665
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,510
before you even start talking they

666
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,090
become frustrated yeah and these IT

667
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,100
people they just change your software

668
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,540
and they don't realize that things don't

669
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,760
work we have to do real work here it's

670
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,340
that kind of emotion that the CIO is not

671
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,500
going to deal with if the easiest thing

672
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,030
to do is oh you want the other tool fine

673
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,350
you get the other tool five work famous

674
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,990
example because they tried Libre Office

675
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,580
and then eventually roll back to

676
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,650
Microsoft Office there's one thing in

677
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,750
Fryeburg that's interesting is that they

678
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,720
all used Munich's template and document

679
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,790
and procurement process manager called

680
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,659
wall max

681
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,759
this is a tool that helps you generate

682
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,919
your forms it has the stamps that's the

683
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,570
seal the signature the whole thing and

684
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,869
if you do a procurement proposal it

685
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,340
fills in all the details that you need

686
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,609
to normally take into account and it did

687
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,799
it so well that it saved you a whole

688
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,359
bunch of time so when they went back to

689
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,769
Microsoft they said that chemical ease

690
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,710
please keep will mix that unfortunately

691
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,009
only works on LibreOffice so okay pain

692
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,149
points maybe they will go back

693
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:41,440
eventually all the other ones Italian

694
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,700
towns there's a whole bunch of them

695
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,830
Basel oh there's the first one Emilia

696
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,590
Romagna region and South Tirol province

697
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,529
they all stopped there Open Office

698
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,179
pilots I think it's key that it's

699
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:56,019
OpenOffice not Libre Office there's a

700
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:57,429
lot of rumors you want to talk to the

701
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,149
Italian people to hear the details but

702
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:02,679
you can say it's corruption you can say

703
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,269
it was false information you can say

704
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,159
it's a bunch of IT people that thought

705
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,409
of their career long term because having

706
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,389
libre office on your resume might not

707
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:13,989
get you in a job in the next career path

708
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:16,419
that you're choosing it did there's all

709
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,369
kinds of things to go on there the one

710
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:19,809
thing that happens with all these towns

711
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,190
is that they will start to break

712
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,649
procurement law again because soon they

713
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,359
will have to buy licenses and they will

714
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,519
ask for max of licenses the European

715
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,309
procurement laws do not allow you to

716
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,229
procure brands or products that set you

717
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:37,499
can procure Linux because it's a brand

718
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,059
but there are tons of people that can

719
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,070
send it to you and therefore that

720
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,409
doesn't inhibit competition it's a major

721
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,799
thing to note and you need to engage the

722
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,809
community that's the fifth point I think

723
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:52,960
it's also the last point now how do you

724
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,489
do that this is a headache for all the

725
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,049
public administrations here are a few

726
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,080
ways to fix it you make sure you require

727
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,609
open source skills the European

728
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,859
Commission like one or two months ago

729
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:06,489
did a call for IT staff and they really

730
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,559
asked through over and through whatever

731
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,359
they require that people have

732
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,919
experienced an open source the change

733
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,779
will come from it in if there's more

734
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,729
people that understand open source that

735
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:17,229
work for the Commission it'll become

736
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:19,299
easier to install open source tools

737
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,619
because these guys will say oh yeah but

738
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,720
we use this in Debian or we use that in

739
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,750
for Dora

740
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,460
that does it like this and before you

741
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,180
know it it'll be all over so when you do

742
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,220
your procurements you can also optimize

743
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,600
it for small and medium-sized companies

744
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,180
and do not require that the company has

745
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,370
50 million turnover the past five years

746
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,710
because that's maybe only two companies

747
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,570
that do this you can look at Sweden

748
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,850
again a good example for the way to were

749
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,760
learning how to organize this they do

750
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,700
frameworks that so they negotiate with

751
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,470
everybody and the negotiate on behalf of

752
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,870
all the public administrations and the

753
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,290
free - Swedish framework for open-source

754
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,850
has basically all the main big not big

755
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,070
small medium-sized companies that do

756
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,570
open-source services are in there

757
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,670
they're like tested and they were

758
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,940
approved and so a municipality doesn't

759
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,230
have to go through this whole selection

760
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,790
process itself it can just use the

761
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,790
framework and say I want this Drupal or

762
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,470
I want this Red Hat or I want this

763
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,110
fedora or whatever brand of open-source

764
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,170
product and they will get the surface

765
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,930
they can just say give me the the five

766
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,390
so service suppliers can send an offer

767
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,090
but they even have the independent

768
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,400
entrepreneurs in there so single person

769
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,010
companies can in that way get jobs the

770
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,330
public administration's helping them

771
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,910
roll out open-source and you need to

772
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,940
promote and facilitate open-source

773
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,540
developments and there are a whole bunch

774
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,310
of ways to do that we shall go to the

775
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,210
next slide and give you a few examples

776
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,860
the city of mount I already introduced

777
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,410
them that's one of the bigger cities in

778
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,230
France I think it's the 8th or the 6th

779
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,670
they first they realized by moving to

780
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,910
libre office we're saving an X amount I

781
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,370
think it was a million for ten thousand

782
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,110
desktops or some like that it doesn't

783
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,610
really matter that's money that

784
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,920
disappears from the IT budget but that's

785
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,450
like not a good thing for the IT

786
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,980
department so they said let's give them

787
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,580
30% and they can keep that for the next

788
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,840
year the next year so they can do other

789
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,700
things with the savings otherwise it's

790
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,110
like thank you for the savings and

791
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,150
that's not an incentive for the IT

792
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,549
department

793
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,730
and so that's one thing they can do

794
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,080
other interesting project but they also

795
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,390
said now we have LibreOffice and there's

796
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,980
a few things that don't work the right

797
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,480
way LibreOffice I'll give you a famous

798
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,549
itself an important example suppose you

799
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:53,260
have a legal document that does your

800
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,760
that fixes the houses and the land

801
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,320
around your house that you want to buy

802
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,660
yourself or if you're a farmer and you

803
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,679
have there's a whole bunch of

804
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:03,650
requirements and it's a bullet list and

805
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,940
then you send it to the next level the

806
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,320
prophets and for them all of us on this

807
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,270
changed into a numbered list it will

808
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,280
lose the legitimacy it will lose the

809
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,929
value this is a problem and in document

810
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,310
interoperability problem that really

811
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,168
makes it difficult for public

812
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,409
administrations to use the mix of Oh X

813
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,989
ml and ODT this is like but the big

814
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,239
headache announced that okay so let's do

815
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,969
a procurement proposal where we will fix

816
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,219
this and a few other problems that we

817
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,300
have and we will return the fixed

818
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,190
product to the upstream of the office so

819
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,699
they're working

820
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,250
I think the procurement is was launched

821
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,159
last year it's it went to a consortium

822
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,399
two companies including Cola Borah one

823
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,989
of the libreoffice developers and so

824
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,520
they are fixing this upstream and this

825
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,859
is a fantastic example of how public

826
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:50,840
administrations realize that their use

827
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,780
of our tax money actually benefits not

828
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,149
only then but it benefits every other

829
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:57,740
public administration and every other

830
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,260
citizen across the world if we want to

831
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,720
go further than European Union and that

832
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,850
fixes that day that nantes fix are now

833
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,710
fixed for people in Denmark to unique is

834
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,500
I think in Europe the biggest public

835
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,420
administration that contributes two main

836
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,550
open-source projects if you look at all

837
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,750
the code then the Commission will win

838
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,630
but that's maybe a different battle but

839
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,340
at the city level Munich is by far the

840
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,660
biggest day contribute well it's right

841
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,130
the notes are not there after this my

842
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,109
memory you'll forgive me if I have it

843
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:33,020
wrong but there's they have 500 patches

844
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,090
or no patches into Libre Office they use

845
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,580
I think Libre Office for and their

846
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,940
patches are in upstream in five but they

847
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,160
have a few issues why they can't upgrade

848
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,560
itself so they have fixed the office for

849
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,290
those code improvements are available to

850
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,030
all of us in five

851
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,070
they have wool mix the template manager

852
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,900
that I mentioned they have an

853
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,190
implementation manager they have tools

854
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,540
to manage the rollout upgrade and

855
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,730
implementation of workstations there's

856
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,250
there's a whole bunch then take the

857
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,700
French government modernization units

858
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,990
one of the ways in which they organize

859
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:18,560
this is in hackathons I can say a few

860
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,210
nice things about those things it was

861
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,330
France has they open-source the tax code

862
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,040
they also open sourced the code that

863
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,380
selects which student goes to which

864
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,270
universities and in both cases it was a

865
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,400
sort of a same Drive let's do the

866
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,950
student example first so this year or

867
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,120
last year the student allotment system

868
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,380
had a few glitches and there were

869
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,970
student unions that were trying to

870
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,920
figure out why this didn't work the way

871
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,120
it should have worked and they started

872
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,340
asking the members in Parliament and

873
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,540
they started asking the minister and the

874
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,880
minister gave answers and then they they

875
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,080
looked at and it doesn't make sense

876
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,820
because that's he says but that's not

877
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,450
what happened

878
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,180
can you send us how this is done send us

879
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,250
the source code and then the Minister

880
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,260
printed the source code and gave them

881
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,310
the source code

882
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,520
this is ridiculous so it's no way we can

883
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,740
check this so then eventually the whole

884
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,540
government realized okay so we need to

885
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,120
check we need to you we need to start

886
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,860
considering source code the way we

887
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,310
consider data we need to publish it if

888
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,840
you need to make it machine readable and

889
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,730
available because we this is how we do

890
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,050
openness this is how we are being

891
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,270
checked by the citizens these days and

892
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,310
it changed the law so now in France if

893
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,650
you want to know an algorithm that is

894
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,960
used in your process you can go to a

895
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,370
course and say can I have that cold

896
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,860
please doesn't really make it available

897
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,960
as open source but it's a start and the

898
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,180
other example is the text code where

899
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,530
what are the guys that worked at then

900
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,840
SiC on a Friday afternoon had you know

901
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,360
his tasks ran out he was an intern and

902
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,070
he said you know what I'll just see if I

903
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,380
can maybe improve the the income-tax

904
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,860
application and so he started digging

905
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,480
and it's a long story and he had to go

906
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,340
to court like two or three times and the

907
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,810
minister said no it is like way too

908
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,770
complex because

909
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,020
it runs on faxes and it runs on PDP's

910
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,640
and it runs it doesn't you know we can't

911
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,070
give it to you or floppy and and then

912
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,230
the minute the the guys that overruled

913
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,000
that decision say yeah technically

914
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,619
difficult that's not a good answer

915
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,470
so you know make it so eventually the

916
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,330
text source code also became available

917
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,550
as open source and so they organized

918
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,800
hackathons where they they asked these

919
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,110
people the use and the means to come to

920
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,910
the Ministry and then look at the code

921
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,350
and see if we can do something more

922
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,210
interesting with it and it's a great

923
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,300
example France is leading here it would

924
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:42,500
be nice if others do the same main

925
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,300
implementations I will speed up because

926
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,890
I think most of these are known for you

927
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,660
and the most running out of time and

928
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,190
maybe there should be some time for

929
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,940
questions I've arranged it in three big

930
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,800
parts because this is the desktop room

931
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
so you have the main complete desktop

932
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,830
operating system implementations then

933
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,840
you'll have the ones that basically do

934
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,520
Libre Office and then I have an annex

935
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,340
which are all the others which I would

936
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,130
do if you want the city for another hour

937
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,800
or something so operating systems and

938
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,070
office productivity the first one 72,000

939
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,810
workstations across all the gendarmerie

940
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:26,600
in France they everywhere here everybody

941
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,490
always says price it's the first thing

942
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,320
they say but the French also make is

943
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,850
very clear that price yeah that's nice

944
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,980
interesting it lowers the total cost of

945
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,530
ownership by 40 percent but man does it

946
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,760
make it much easier for us to do IT on

947
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,109
workstations his open-source stuff we

948
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,460
should have done this years ago they had

949
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,609
a guy he would fly to Australia and then

950
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:49,580
fly to an island in the Pacific and then

951
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,070
had to go to an island by canoe and then

952
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,080
by ferry and then he had to visit all

953
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,170
these islands to update the police posts

954
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,310
antivirus definitions he would come back

955
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,560
he would make it to Paris and they would

956
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,930
give him a new desk set of city rooms

957
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,730
and he could go back again he would be

958
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,510
gone all the time

959
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,340
fantastic job I would love to have it

960
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,280
but with the window which is what they

961
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,960
use they don't need that because it

962
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,359
rolls out automatically and

963
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,700
Isis whole virus thing is much less of a

964
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,539
headache they also they this they say

965
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:26,450
our eating steak is much easier because

966
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,849
we can control everything and it is P

967
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,039
now we program it here and it rolls out

968
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,890
across the whole gendarmerie 72,000

969
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,650
desktops yeah about almost it says here

970
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,599
I have 41 minutes and so and they say

971
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,059
it's priceless to be to get rid of

972
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:48,769
you're looking the second one is city of

973
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:53,989
Munich that's 18,000 desktops also MINIX

974
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,269
and LibreOffice the city of Saragossa

975
00:40:56,269 --> 00:41:02,690
which is 1200 it's a fragile process

976
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,210
these are a few like a handful of people

977
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,249
that are doing this and they're under an

978
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:08,779
enormous amount of time pressure and

979
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:13,099
using all their free time to do this a

980
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,140
quick list of the ones that are doing

981
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,789
Libre Office or OpenOffice but it's

982
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:17,630
mostly Libre Office

983
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,849
so first the ministries in France has

984
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,829
500 thousands of there's half a million

985
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,200
and they really use it I've checked

986
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,279
there's a few times over the past few

987
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,049
weeks they read it's their first it's

988
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:29,779
the only operating system office suite

989
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,329
on those desks it's 17 of the 33

990
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:35,869
ministries and in the Dutch central

991
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,670
government that's all about a hundred

992
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,890
thousand that number is not entirely Shh

993
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,569
they couldn't really know they couldn't

994
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:42,769
really tell me how much they have but

995
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,269
this is the total number of central

996
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,160
government civil servants and they all

997
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,410
have access to it

998
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,779
Ministry of Defense Italy that's going

999
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:52,339
to be a hundred thousand workstations

1000
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:55,069
with Libre Office it will make it the

1001
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:58,869
biggest one Extremadura this project I

1002
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:01,339
put it here because it's famous but it's

1003
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:01,789
broken

1004
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,130
these numbers are no longer valid and

1005
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,019
they're rolling it all back to Libre to

1006
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:07,970
Microsoft I'm trying to figure out

1007
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,910
what's going on but that's basically a

1008
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,789
dead project to lose 10,000 workstations

1009
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,950
bust country 8,000 workstations the

1010
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,079
police in Lithuania 8,000 workstations

1011
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,509
down to 5,000 so this is the

1012
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,160
I'll skip the annex the key policies

1013
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,240
that you need to look at if you're

1014
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,550
interested I already introduced France

1015
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,500
so that's the one the other one is you

1016
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,090
know take the United Kingdom's there

1017
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,960
open source

1018
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,690
sorry open standards policy and Bulgaria

1019
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,510
also famous because they managed to get

1020
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,840
into law that all code developed for and

1021
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,180
by public registration from day one must

1022
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,190
be done on a repository which will be

1023
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,080
mirrored to get hub this is the way to

1024
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,590
do it

1025
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,050
for for a public administration you

1026
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,790
hosted on your own repository and you

1027
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,750
link it to get it keep it on the console

1028
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,780
you expected benefits how much salary I

1029
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:10,860
still have minutes I'm sorry

1030
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,200
I'll just this is one more slightly

1031
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,180
expected benefits it's clear for all of

1032
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,990
us here autonomy sovereignty and control

1033
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,490
the efficiency in the growth that's an

1034
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,860
important one the growth of local

1035
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,300
enterprises it really happens in France

1036
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,850
and in the bus country you can see this

1037
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,400
so what's missing this is the last slide

1038
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,170
we need more politicians that know how

1039
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,090
this works we need more politicians that

1040
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,910
realize these are the benefits and these

1041
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,880
are the disadvantages of proprietary and

1042
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,040
we need well-organized the focus e so

1043
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
this is slowly happening but it's not

1044
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,940
there yet and we need patches for

1045
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,230
procurement because procurement in

1046
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,000
Europe is really broken and it's in

1047
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,620
favor of proprietary and that needs to

1048
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,260
be fixed ASAP and that's it

1049
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,510
thank you very much

1050
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:05,179
[Applause]
