1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,960
last presentation just a quick wrap-up

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,460
so before I do that I will need to

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,190
excuse myself my name is Eduardo from

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,609
EBU I'm the lead on video research and

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,240
development and co-organizer of this

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
let's say dev room mainly led by

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,650
Christophe and we try to do it every

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,730
year so I would just try to sum up all

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,650
the interesting presentation that we had

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,680
today so that would me if you were here

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,859
you can also interject or help if summer

12
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,310
is not to your liking right so what did

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,860
we have this year so this year we had we

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,980
tried to cover several topics we had we

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,320
covered actually frameworks on for

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,500
multimedia applications we had you piped

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,910
a streamer JPAC presenting then we had a

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,180
nice presentation about codecs on the

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,550
new codec coming from the open media

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,989
Alliance yeah yeah you can put it the

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,210
way you want but I think it means the

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,970
same anyway and then we had let's a

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,490
short presentation about stress testing

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,070
applications and api's from Max Max

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,180
morose morose yes and we had a quick

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,640
review of standards many open standards

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,670
but on the audio side and also on the

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,670
subtitle subtracting sides from the

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,759
colleagues from IRT then we had as we

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,960
covered as well quality control in broad

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,320
extent with the media info and cat a

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,409
struct which is another project that

33
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,079
will look look into a few seconds and we

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,840
had a few use cases covered so two use

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,110
cases one from false from trace trace TV

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,140
not forced away which was about

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,060
transcoding open source transcoding and

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,409
we had as well a case from Kaltura which

39
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,340
was more on live streaming based on

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,099
nginx and and others so now I will go

41
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,849
through so first of all we had a quick

42
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,849
history let's say overview from Kaltura

43
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:18,450
so

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,200
for those of you who do not know Kaltura

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,630
Kaltura is just let's say antwuan video

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,300
on-demand platform and they were there

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,950
were just basically telling us that they

48
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,660
were in the open source domain since 10

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,910
years and that they took advantage of

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,010
you know the uptake of video you know

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,680
since the introduction of YouTube to

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,870
actually establish their their framework

53
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,120
and now they are trying to get into the

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,690
live let's say streaming domain because

55
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,459
it's becoming more and more important

56
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,200
for broadcasters and not only so their

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,760
next actually step is is to move from

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,360
the educational let's say or MOOCs type

59
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,370
of application that they were providing

60
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,660
to more let's say content delivery type

61
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,970
of services then we went to the live

62
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,819
let's say demo from Jess so jess

63
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,670
actually showed us how we could quickly

64
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,489
using you know different open source

65
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,680
tool establish a live stream er based on

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,570
rtmp it was a very let's say speedy demo

67
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,600
from her she managed to do it quite

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,780
properly what she kind of mentioned here

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,700
was there was a very interesting point

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,709
about whether you would you would like

71
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,420
to use rtmp or web RTC and her advice

72
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,010
was first of all to use maybe nginx as a

73
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,239
platform because it was more adapted for

74
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,829
rtmp but you could use actually other

75
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,660
solutions if you were more interested in

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,620
using web bot WebRTC they went for nginx

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,470
because they use nginx in their

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,140
environment so basically in Kaltura

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,109
Enterprise so there they tend to

80
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,810
actually go for engine ich by default so

81
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,780
if you have let's say a different

82
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,720
opinion you can actually use another

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,940
tool but her recommendation for rtmp

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,108
streaming would be to go for nginx then

85
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,590
we had a quick let's say presentation on

86
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,550
on TTML which is the time time text

87
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,250
markup language so it is used for sept

88
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,090
and it was presented by andreas tie from

89
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,670
IOT the point of this presentation was

90
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,060
just to show over the whole production

91
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,160
untoned media chain where do we support

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,100
actually different subtitling standards

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,350
and formats so from his point of view as

94
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,420
an expert and as the chairman of the EBU

95
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,150
group on the subtitling most of the

96
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,790
open-source tools are let's say

97
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,010
embracing subtype the sub-site least

98
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,140
standards especially the profile IM sc1

99
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,190
i think ID yeah that's it so IMS C 1 is

100
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,640
the profile that is let's say taking you

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,970
know attraction at the moment and the

102
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,480
another profile of the of subtitling

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,910
which is the same TTT is being dropped

104
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,120
basically by by the industry so we may

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,080
see more and more the I am SC one let's

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,169
say profile coming up in the next in the

107
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,320
next years and if you would like to have

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
more details on the presentation on the

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,060
let's say the tools that support the

110
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,950
latest profiles for subtitling you just

111
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,180
go through the presentation you have a

112
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,040
list of all the tools there I try to

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,280
capture them here but don't think I have

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,210
all of them there last but I mean third

115
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,700
presentation trash TV very interesting

116
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,440
use case built taking different building

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,380
blocks to build a transcoder the key

118
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,200
point of the presentation was that first

119
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,450
of all the transcoder was built to serve

120
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,490
actually the increasing need from the

121
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,340
employees in the company to actually

122
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,700
transport content so not only content

123
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,220
let's say producers but also community

124
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,740
managers that have to transcode content

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,110
to you know serve their let's say web

126
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,220
platforms and so forth and you can

127
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,610
correct me if I'm if I'm mistaking but

128
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,950
what was interesting in this is that now

129
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,040
they have which actually are quite quite

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,630
a good maturity level and they want to

131
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,450
share this application so put it either

132
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,410
on a get up and improve improve as well

133
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,860
the let's say ability to duplicate this

134
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,689
this

135
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,789
this example this interesting use case

136
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,989
so from from what was captured this use

137
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:54,869
case is based on ffmpeg basically and a

138
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,929
set of other open-source tools note GSG

139
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:01,169
query and so forth so we look forward to

140
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,419
to receive an email saying now the

141
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,469
project is you know is on github and

142
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,079
ready to go and to be deployed in other

143
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,319
compare cooperations j streamer so j

144
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,939
streamer as we said is one of this

145
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,849
pipeline based multimedia frameworks and

146
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,249
we had another one which was presented

147
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:24,449
so you pipe j streamer is a bit older

148
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,329
than you pipe but you pipe is has has a

149
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:29,659
bit more traction today it's actually

150
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,709
taking traction and sorry thank you no

151
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,069
problem

152
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:41,599
i take it after okay so j streamer is

153
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,639
covering a large spectrum of codecs

154
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
there was a bit of confusion on j

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,979
streamer basically saying that josh

156
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,909
humor was either a codec or or a

157
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:56,069
transcoder or and so forth just you much

158
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,409
more framework and you can use it to

159
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,439
deliver different use cases and it's

160
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,949
part of the let's say the propaganda

161
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,349
campaign to try and remove this

162
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,199
confusion in terms of support it

163
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,899
supports several codecs up to h.265 at

164
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,719
least web RTC and what they want to

165
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,289
support as next step is SDI over IP so j

166
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,899
streamer was was mainly used for let's

167
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,199
say low let's say non-professional

168
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,389
applications I would say not

169
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,389
professional broadcast applications and

170
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,129
that made may be much from my opinion

171
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:34,879
the difference between you pipe and and

172
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,078
NJ streamer is that you pipe would be

173
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:40,129
more driven and used by you know

174
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,500
professional broadcasters then J

175
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,939
streamer even though there are few use

176
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,559
cases where you could find just rumor in

177
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,009
professional broadcast applications but

178
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:54,750
it is not that that well let's say

179
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,519
introduced in this in the professional

180
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,920
domain so is trying to

181
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,790
go quickly on JPAC interesting use case

182
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,720
JPAC mainly try to present to us how

183
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,249
they encoded 360 video so basically it

184
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,410
was to show that the Dare approach in

185
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,449
reducing the let's say bandwidth or

186
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,549
increasing the bandwidth efficiency so

187
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,009
they try to tile the pictures or the 360

188
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,410
picture you have and they try to stream

189
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,139
to your to your mobile phone or to the

190
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,720
device you have the tile that you are

191
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,359
currently viewing in higher quality so

192
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,790
basically what how as you move across

193
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,899
the the 360 video you see a refresh of

194
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,819
the quality as you go from one view to

195
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:45,699
another because the view of you are

196
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,499
actually seeing is stream at a poor

197
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,199
lower quality and then increase to a

198
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:55,329
better quality this this let's say

199
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,929
tiling mechanism is supported by mp4 box

200
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,429
that was actually the main message of

201
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,199
the presentation and you can already

202
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,089
trial it I hope it was it came across

203
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,889
properly during the presentation but

204
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,989
mainly mainly that said there were also

205
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:13,839
lobbying for having different let's say

206
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
quality quality strategies because you

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,949
can actually use different tiling models

208
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:24,299
to improve the efficiency of your your

209
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,149
compression or the bandwidth efficiency

210
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,049
and at the moment there are no specific

211
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:33,850
recommendation about a specific tiling

212
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,129
model Facebook actually had previously

213
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,779
splicing model that they abandoned it

214
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,110
was called this pyramidal mode but they

215
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,499
do not use it anymore so we type try we

216
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,720
are kind of going to toward convergence

217
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,269
we have a few a few tiling models which

218
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,369
are now available but we don't have a

219
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:58,809
let's say yeah a clear a clear view on

220
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,699
which one is the most optimal basically

221
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:05,559
for for a 360 video of streaming so at

222
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,009
the moment MP MP for box implements for

223
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:15,090
for tiling models you pipe as I said

224
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,980
new roughly new compared to JJ streamer

225
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,640
has some traction mainly driven for the

226
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,900
professional broadcast domain and really

227
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,490
a framework to watch I'm actually very

228
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,160
glad to see that it supports ten bits so

229
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,030
some very professional format like the

230
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,370
v2 10 there it's very difficult to find

231
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,930
a framework that supports it and the the

232
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,260
EBU I want to want to wait so these are

233
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,790
actually framework that could be easily

234
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,860
integrated in a professional domain and

235
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,200
it's actually nice to see that there are

236
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,400
projects which are delivering these

237
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,090
protocols media info very nice

238
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,110
presentation lots of tools I knew only

239
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,940
the media info one so the metadata

240
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,160
extraction tool and actually the media

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,570
conformance checker was also introduced

242
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,420
as well as the let's say baseband

243
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,990
quality control 2 which is the QC 2 I

244
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,810
wasn't really sure if it was you that

245
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,350
developed the QC 2 so the basement one

246
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,530
wasn't really clear that's that's what I

247
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,360
I think I've already captured actually

248
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,610
so but it was interesting to see that

249
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,950
from a media extraction a metadata

250
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,760
extraction tool you extended the let's

251
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,490
say the set of of product that you could

252
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,910
provide from conformance to let's say

253
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,230
deep beat definitions and down to

254
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,540
actually the baseband quality assessment

255
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,390
with different metric so psnr ssim and

256
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,940
so forth and one of the point one of the

257
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,120
question that came up was to whether

258
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,340
media info was interested to broaden the

259
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,410
set of metrics that would be supported

260
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,540
by the paceman tool and it was just

261
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,260
submitted to a future future prospect or

262
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,590
next steps media info is widely used in

263
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,950
the professional domain and it's it's a

264
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,690
very very nice tool cat a struct is a

265
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,630
parser for

266
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,590
based on the binary binary s-- mainly

267
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,130
the the the point there was to create a

268
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,000
posture that could easily read from a

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,220
binary binary file and reduce actually

270
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,530
the complexity of let's say finding the

271
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,510
documentation of different file formats

272
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,120
and so forth interesting project there

273
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,990
is a workshop that might be introduced

274
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,680
in the coming weeks so if you want more

275
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,530
information about this project send a

276
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,000
quick tweet to kattay underscore IO if

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,240
you want codec interesting codec from

278
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,750
the open media Alliance yeah okay again

279
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,400
as I said you can put put it the way you

280
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,570
want this open media Alliance came up is

281
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,850
it's a consortium of big internet

282
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,160
internet companies Netflix Amazon and so

283
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,870
forth are in and it was a bit of a

284
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,000
reaction to the licensing issues around

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
HC BC and h.265 mainly so it's

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
interesting to see that there is a codec

287
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,650
coming up now from the presentation what

288
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,920
came out came out was the issue that

289
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,380
they have to create a royalty-free codec

290
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,570
basically so they have several tools

291
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,470
they have almost 50 assessment tools

292
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,990
FIDIC 50 coding tools sorry which are

293
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,020
being assessed to improve the the let's

294
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,940
say compression quality of the of the

295
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,640
codec but one of the issue is to find

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,430
out whether there are underground IPRs

297
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,170
or i am i Piazon though on those tools

298
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,390
what was said was that this codec may be

299
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,160
released kind of at least the B stream

300
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,460
might be frozen in q4 2017 but they were

301
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,750
previously a couple of dates where it

302
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,660
was supposed to be frozen and then

303
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,760
postponed again so therefore there may

304
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,470
be there it we may have a new

305
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,790
royalty-free codec in q4 2017 but we'll

306
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,780
see one slightly you know off the track

307
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,459
quote from the

308
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,480
was that discotheque everyone is

309
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,170
currently more performant than h.265

310
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,970
which I would like to see I mean if it

311
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,360
is said it's really great and it would

312
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,579
be a real challenger if it is royalty

313
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,199
fee free so something to look forward to

314
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,439
first presented by maximal rules

315
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,779
basically a platform to stress test your

316
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,199
api's and your project in a nutshell

317
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,939
they have the OSS FERS let's say fuzzing

318
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,600
as a service available so if you want to

319
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,389
let's say embrace this new technique of

320
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,759
stressing your application and so forth

321
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,790
you are welcome to join the project and

322
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,160
access the 6000 course they have

323
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,209
available to stress test your project a

324
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:37,199
yes 67 and 70 basically it was a

325
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,279
presentation on the standards from our

326
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,610
colleague which is still in the room it

327
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,639
was basically showing for the AES 67

328
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,389
that a concatenation of already existing

329
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,629
open standards can be used to improve

330
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,720
the interoperability for you know audio

331
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,769
voice over IP transmission there was one

332
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,569
key mention here since we are in the new

333
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:07,470
open source environment that es 67 is

334
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,419
already supported by the two framework

335
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,230
we showed today except the connection

336
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,079
management so we look forward to see it

337
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,819
you know supported by by your frameworks

338
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:28,830
if it is possible so if if possible that

339
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,970
would be nice and that's it roughly in

340
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,789
terms of a summary what I can tell you

341
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,279
is it's always a pleasure to organize

342
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,070
these dev rooms but we need contributors

343
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,179
for presentations so we will be here

344
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:50,159
next year again the same team if if open

345
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:50,700
ardent

346
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,360
and open broadcast systems are

347
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,330
you know if they accept to be to be with

348
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,980
us exactly give us good ratings we try

349
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,660
to maintain this track because we saw

350
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,910
five years ago that it was really

351
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,780
missing but and as you can see we tend

352
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
to have you know a nice audience so

353
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,320
please contribute bring new

354
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,080
presentations and even ideas for new

355
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,140
topics that could be addressed and see

356
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,310
you in 2018 maybe or in September at IBC

357
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,920
for those that could go to IBC thank you

358
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,780
very much

359
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,109
