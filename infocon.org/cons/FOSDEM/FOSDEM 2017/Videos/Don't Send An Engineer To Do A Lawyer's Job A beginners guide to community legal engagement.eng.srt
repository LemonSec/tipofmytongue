1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
right our last speaker

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,389
thank you very much well thank you for

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,920
staying to the end of the afternoon I

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,920
appreciate that so I've got to talk for

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,380
you that I'm testing on you to find out

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,490
whether this is the way that I'm going

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,870
to spend all my conferences for the

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,500
coming year and the the talk is called

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,660
don't send an engineer to do a lawyer's

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,800
job it this was inspired by a thread on

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,859
the Apache legal mailing list in 2015

12
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,730
and in this thread somebody came onto

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,130
the mailing list with a request on

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,010
behalf of their come their company and

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,110
to my eyes at least this thread embodied

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,630
every single thing that an experienced

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,760
lawyer who was coming into free and open

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,200
source communities for the first time

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,950
should absolutely not do and so I've

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,110
I've read through it and I've rift on

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,660
that theme and put together for you a

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,790
set of lessons really that are drawn

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,189
from my experiences of watching repeated

24
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,960
encounters with communities by legal

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,140
staff and by the the engineers who are

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,659
supported by that legal stuff it's not

27
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,850
intended as a criticism of the company

28
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,580
and so I've not named the company that's

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,260
involved there is one person in the room

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,909
who already knows who that company is

31
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,060
which is Fontana down here because he

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,560
made a critical comment during the

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,510
conversation so I've I've told you I've

34
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,860
warned him that he's in the in the

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,750
presentation and he's sworn to secrecy

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,740
over who who the company actually is

37
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,150
I've got to give disclaimers so other

38
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,880
approaches are possible may include nuts

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,909
I'm not a lawyer and could not plausibly

40
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,220
play one on television there is another

41
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,990
problem with this presentation which is

42
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,390
I couldn't come up with it conceivably

43
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,579
with any pretty pictures to put up so

44
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,500
there are instead gratuitous cat

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,810
pictures during the presentation are

46
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,520
introduced here this is this is poppy

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,869
our cat and this is a failure and they

48
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,939
they'll pop up during the presentation

49
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,419
just to make it less boring so the

50
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,878
background to the talk in this thread on

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,790
Apache legal a representative of a very

52
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,340
well-known company that was already

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,210
active

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,930
in the Apache community showed up and

55
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,880
asked for some variations to some of

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,850
Apaches standard terms now if you're at

57
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,110
all involved in the Apache Software

58
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,880
Foundation you all know that showing up

59
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,980
and asking for variations two terms is

60
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,100
not a great way to make yourself popular

61
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,990
so this company had sent one of their

62
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,240
Apache member staff somebody was an

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Apache dogma email address to make sure

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,250
that they had as much stature as

65
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,830
possible in the conversation it turned

66
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,140
out once we dug into it that the changes

67
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,910
they want you to make related to patent

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,810
rights and the writer of the thread is

69
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,370
apparently a member of the open-source

70
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,400
team at the company and appears strongly

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,170
appears to be following directions from

72
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,690
legal counsel but the legal counsel

73
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,370
involved never shows up on the thread

74
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,500
and we never find out who that person is

75
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,200
it's also likely that this is not an

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,240
example of their previous behavior or of

77
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,610
their later behavior but one of the

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,560
messages in the thread indicates a new

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,240
general counsel had recently been

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,370
appointed at the company and it looks

81
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,560
extremely likely that this whole move

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,450
was at the direction of that new general

83
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,300
counsel who had just come in from an

84
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,180
extremely notoriously toxic corporation

85
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,080
that will also remain unnamed and

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,610
clearly had limited experience of

87
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,050
dealing with communities of any kind

88
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,960
least of all open-source communities so

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,460
that's that's the background for you so

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,670
in the initial email the engineer

91
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,920
brought in a league of agreement for

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,620
Apache to consider changing their their

93
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,180
software grant agreement they want you

94
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,920
to put a new project into the Apache

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Incubator and evidently the they

96
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,410
downloaded the standard SGA and the

97
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,630
legal counsel had read through it and

98
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,570
said these terms aren't quite right

99
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,920
please could you go get Apache to change

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
them for us and they had drafted a

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,780
completely new version of the SGA and

102
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,510
attached to the email that the initial

103
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,190
email in the thread there was this new

104
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,310
SGA and we'll say more about that in a

105
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,210
moment

106
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,820
so I would like to suggest to you that

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,730
any community has got legal documents

108
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,800
has got those legal documents to

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
create a set of freedoms and to create

110
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,620
an environment of certainty for the

111
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,819
people who are contributing to the

112
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,069
project and those legal agreements

113
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,419
create that certainty and they are

114
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,030
usually a consensus activity and so for

115
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,620
you to come in and suggest that you want

116
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,560
to change them is to you for you to come

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,750
in and challenge the environment of

118
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,550
certainty that the developers are

119
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,919
currently enjoying and that's the reason

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,509
you will get rejected it's not because

121
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,099
they hate you or because they dislike

122
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,199
your corporation it's because they've

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,449
already done this and you weren't there

124
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,039
and now you're coming in and trying to

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,409
open the old issue again and so they

126
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,389
will typically put you away if you try

127
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,909
and do that if you do find a bug in an

128
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,860
agreement well that's great but raise it

129
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,129
sometime when it's not urgent raise it

130
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,469
when when people are going to be happier

131
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:27,319
about talking about it okay click this

132
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,039
is exciting

133
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,340
I have a failure back again so the next

134
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,719
thing they did was they attach the

135
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,460
document and the document didn't have a

136
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,699
red line so there was no there was no no

137
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,830
information say what they had changed in

138
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,840
the document there was also no narrative

139
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,550
about the changes explaining what

140
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,469
changes have been made and there was

141
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,690
also no justification for the changes

142
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,360
now as you know open-source communities

143
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,550
are really not excited about being given

144
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,580
very large dumps of fait accompli work

145
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,340
and being asked in to merge them in with

146
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,259
the source code and the same applies to

147
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,990
legal documents that environment of

148
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,719
consensus uncertainty should not be

149
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,389
modified by a completely new version

150
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,449
that appears from the ether and

151
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,099
consequently I would say that combining

152
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,419
a large dump of change and a lack of

153
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,490
rationale is probably the very best

154
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,190
recipe to make yourself unpopular in a

155
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,349
community and unfortunately this person

156
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,729
did both just as a side note that this

157
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,680
whole phrase here's a special agreement

158
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
we need you to sign which normally goes

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,550
along with an NDA or something is

160
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,440
another really great way to get yourself

161
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,409
out of favor in a community now to

162
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,390
explain why that is

163
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,280
open-source community is a multilateral

164
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,680
environment there are many parties

165
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,930
involved and they have multilaterally

166
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,800
reached agreements and that that

167
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,540
multilateral state is actually what

168
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,940
creates the freedom and as soon as you

169
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,280
enter into that multilateral environment

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,160
and start creating one-to-one bilateral

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,870
relationships you undermine the whole

172
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,000
community's freedom and you do that for

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,810
two reasons

174
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,930
first of all you create contexts where

175
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,090
everywhere some people are not permitted

176
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,120
to participate and secondly you create

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,310
an instrument of power for the party

178
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,470
creating agreement because they can

179
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,510
threaten to modify it or to withdraw it

180
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,420
at any time as a sanction for behavior

181
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,670
that isn't required so any kind of

182
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,680
agreement that is bilateral being

183
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,570
imposed within a community which is

184
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,820
multilateral is automatically going to

185
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,440
be considered bad whether it's an NDA

186
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,720
whether it is some kind of a software

187
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,180
licensing grant whether it is a patent

188
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,370
license anything bilateral is going to

189
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,140
be rejected and it's a really bad idea

190
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,470
to bring it into the community the only

191
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,980
who came in also indicated that really

192
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,430
this wasn't his thing and he came in

193
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,740
with lots of cut and paste sections that

194
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,660
had clearly come from an internal email

195
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,000
and one imagines that he received an

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
email with little little bars around his

197
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,660
saying you can make this bit public and

198
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,480
so he cuts and pastes and sticks it in

199
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,580
the message and sends it off to Apache

200
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,820
and while it's inevitable that there

201
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,370
will be people in your company who you

202
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,770
need to bring to consensus before you

203
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,260
can act with the community it's really a

204
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,900
bad idea to send into the community to

205
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,600
negotiate a powerless proxy and that

206
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
applies to code contributions as well as

207
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,260
it applies to engagements over

208
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,150
administration or over legal agreements

209
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,030
if your company has been thinking of

210
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,159
having an open-source department that

211
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,229
will have all the people who face the

212
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,330
open-source community and what they will

213
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,490
do is submit code on behalf of the real

214
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,350
developers who live in secret in a plan

215
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,540
in a backroom that's not going to work

216
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,610
and you know that's not going to work

217
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,680
well it doesn't work for legal

218
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,690
agreements either you really have got to

219
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,720
send in an empowered expert to go make

220
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,970
the negotiations

221
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,799
and so there's quite a few people in

222
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,049
this room who are that sort of empowered

223
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:04,229
X were people like Fontana down here he

224
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,619
comes into public discussions and

225
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:10,299
represents his employer and does it in a

226
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,099
very thoughtful and integrated way in

227
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,169
the community well that's how you do it

228
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,809
you send a lawyer you don't send an

229
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:17,619
engineer

230
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,599
unless that engineer happens to be Roy

231
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,709
fielding in which case there's no

232
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:29,559
problem ok cat picture so the the

233
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,089
correspondence it begins to get

234
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,579
frustrated by being told well you don't

235
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,529
know what you're doing do you and begins

236
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,839
to suggest that maybe what should happen

237
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,509
is they should get their people to talk

238
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,169
to our people and so he actually asks at

239
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,359
one point to have their attorney speak

240
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,989
to your attorney now there are actually

241
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,939
legal advisors at Apache who are helping

242
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,669
the board with legal decisions but it's

243
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,849
not normal for you to ask to speak to

244
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,979
them as the first activity you should

245
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,839
probably come into the community and

246
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,579
talk to the legal discuss mailing list

247
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,859
and have your open conversation because

248
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,029
you're trying to affect this

249
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,459
multilateral environment and immediately

250
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,839
trying to go into a bilateral

251
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,179
negotiation is a sign of distrust and a

252
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,379
sign of disrespect

253
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,409
if Apache says to you our lawyer would

254
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,879
like to talk to you about this that's

255
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,189
fair enough but for you to show up and

256
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,979
ask for a one-on-one with Apaches lawyer

257
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,720
is again not going to make you any

258
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,970
friends so that kind of persisted for a

259
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,179
little while in the conversation and

260
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,279
then the the writer began to get more

261
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,399
frustrated and tried to dis to encourage

262
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,129
Apache to create a special process this

263
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,169
is an urgent code contribution it's got

264
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,029
to be made really fast we need to fix

265
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,819
this solution here let's resolve it this

266
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,259
way now Apache has got well-worn

267
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,499
processes for making decisions if you go

268
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:59,619
into the Apache legal mailing list

269
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,119
you'll find there are a number of people

270
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,439
there who will say to you that there's

271
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,599
no rush that they've got to make

272
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,539
decisions slowly and it's not a matter

273
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,999
of the process being slow and broken

274
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,830
it's slow by design

275
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,290
it's it's working when it's slow it's

276
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,010
broken when it's fast and so it was a

277
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,110
big error I think to do this and as

278
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,850
indeed one of the correspondents on the

279
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,130
mailing list said is they their new way

280
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,950
was simply a way of avoiding the people

281
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,570
with the most experience who were going

282
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,360
to spot the defects and that was I

283
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,860
probably actually what the company

284
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,330
wanted was to avoid the people who

285
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,230
really knew what was going on so now

286
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,300
they begin to play the the wounded card

287
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,130
we're just trying to make a con why are

288
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,530
you making this so hard for us we're

289
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,350
just trying to make a contribution and

290
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,760
this was the point at which one

291
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,210
community member who to remain nameless

292
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,270
was pointed out that there's a

293
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,370
substantial change that had been made in

294
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,220
the unread line document was to remove a

295
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,940
grant a patent grant to future patents

296
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,470
filed by the company on the code they

297
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,900
were contributing and it seemed likely

298
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,460
that this company had decided they

299
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,550
wanted to remain free to file patents on

300
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,320
ideas that were embodied in the code and

301
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,560
then potentially pursue the of the

302
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,140
Apache community for them later and that

303
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,600
did lead to a momentous point where this

304
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,460
person who pointed this point out was

305
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,250
said to be an extremely clever person by

306
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,500
Kim jong-il ski who was the president of

307
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,230
Apache at the time something that I

308
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,730
believe you have a back you have a gold

309
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,890
badge or something I don't know that has

310
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,920
that on so they were they were trying to

311
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,930
hide things and it's it's not always

312
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,150
easy to hide things from communities so

313
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,290
they they they try their last-ditch

314
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,200
attempt but unfortunately the president

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,860
of Apache said no and said that the

316
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,010
changes may look beefed be framed as

317
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,620
making a clarification to the SGA but

318
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,000
actually those clarifications are of

319
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,760
primary benefit to your company now I

320
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,380
think to everybody of all of us who have

321
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,210
been reading the mailing list this was

322
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,980
exactly what was going to happen from

323
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,700
the very first post I don't think anyone

324
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,680
was in any doubt that the request was

325
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,810
going to be declined but then the next

326
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,570
thing that happened after that was well

327
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,860
it turned out they were very comfortable

328
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,870
we

329
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,040
the SJ after all and within 12 hours of

330
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
being told no you can't do this they

331
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
said well well to hell with it will sign

332
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,700
it anyway and so if you want to round

333
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,220
out your your miss experience with the

334
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,440
community a great way to do it is when

335
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,270
you lose is to show that you had just

336
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,110
been playing a corporate game all along

337
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,730
that will make sure the next time you

338
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,290
make a request for a change no one gives

339
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,140
you the slightest time of day so to

340
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,180
summarize for you what did they do wrong

341
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,930
well first of all they sent a non-expert

342
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,540
unempowered proxy secondly they tried to

343
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,000
act bilaterally in the environment which

344
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,480
is inherently multilateral thirdly they

345
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,910
tried to circumvent the well one

346
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,880
accepted consensus the consensus which

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,860
creates the freedom that the community

348
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,440
enjoys for developing software fourthly

349
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,690
they condescended to the community at

350
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,420
one point they said that no one here is

351
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,160
an expert let's get our lawyers together

352
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,650
and I think exactly it was actually Roy

353
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,300
fielding that popped up around that

354
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,860
point and said you know I've a good idea

355
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,250
what's going on here they tried to

356
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,410
change the license and if there's ever

357
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,380
one thing to tell your council it is you

358
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,529
can't do that you know you're used to

359
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,080
doing commercial negotiations and those

360
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,140
are where two companies are trying to

361
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,529
broker a non-combat zone between their

362
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,140
two competing objectives and you change

363
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,640
the license agreements in that world

364
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,830
this is not that world that license is

365
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,830
not a bilateral peace treaty between two

366
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,320
warring companies this is a multilateral

367
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,779
statement of rights by a collaborative

368
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,709
community and you never change it as

369
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,390
possibly hard to change most license

370
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,770
agreements that are have been in use for

371
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,220
any length of time they sixthly tried to

372
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,670
dump an unexplained set of changes and

373
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,980
seventh and worst they tried to conceal

374
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,770
their true self interest and I think

375
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,900
that those are probably the seven

376
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,430
lessons that you should give to your

377
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,400
council to explain how to deal with an

378
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,079
open-source community so what should

379
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,610
they have done well they should have

380
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,709
found an empowered and qualified person

381
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:38,430
who was

382
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,170
not acting as a proxy but was acting in

383
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,420
their main job they should have

384
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,540
understood Apaches process and followed

385
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,670
that process and been told by Apache

386
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,529
when the process needed changing rather

387
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,089
than suggesting the process needed

388
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,779
changing for them they should have made

389
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,640
the changes if they thought the SJ was

390
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,230
wrong they should have made the changes

391
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,330
before they had a problem rather than

392
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,220
tried to make changes in response to

393
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,410
their perceived problem they should have

394
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,940
made sure they did all of their talking

395
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,459
in community spaces so that everybody

396
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,320
can participate from the community

397
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,060
community spaces don't need to be public

398
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,490
apache has private mailing lists that

399
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,470
are members only when things shouldn't

400
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,990
be made public to the general public but

401
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,600
Apache generally is not happy about you

402
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,589
trying to have one-on-one conversations

403
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,959
with people to circumvent the community

404
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,779
and don't try and go lawyer to lawyer

405
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,089
with open source communities until the

406
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,790
community invites you to do it you'll

407
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,470
know if you get it right because at the

408
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,170
end of the process your lawyer will be

409
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,270
told either that the cleverest person in

410
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,640
the room or they'll be told that they

411
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,260
should apply for membership of the

412
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,480
community or they will generally be

413
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,370
consulted over future activities they'll

414
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,339
be treated as a community member and the

415
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,440
truth is that that lawyers are the

416
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,080
members that we need in our communities

417
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,029
you know we've got plenty of developers

418
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,370
and and we've got plenty of users but

419
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,990
actually it's really good to adopt a

420
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,270
lawyer too so that you can get that

421
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,699
expert opinion without having to pay for

422
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,790
it

423
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,829
and so that is everything that I was

424
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,900
going to say to you and a gratuitous cat

425
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,630
thanks you for your time and I would be

426
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,880
very happy to entertain questions or two

427
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:31,490
because they understand what they tried

428
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,890
to remove so when you donate software to

429
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,480
the Apache Software Foundation they ask

430
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,370
you to sign a contributor agreement and

431
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,200
that contributor agreement doesn't

432
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,730
actually transfer the copyright to

433
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,460
Apache but he does give Apache all of

434
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,110
the rights that are implicated in the

435
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,540
Apache License one of those things

436
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,450
includes an unlimited license to the

437
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,760
patents and the reason that they asked

438
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,650
for unlimited license to the patterns is

439
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,150
to inoculate the Apache Software

440
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,280
Foundation and its members and its

441
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,530
software users from any possible patent

442
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,750
action in the future what this company

443
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,309
was trying to do was to remove that

444
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,140
compulsion to provide a patent license

445
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,809
to the Apache Software Foundation

446
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,950
presumably because they quite fancied

447
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,660
the idea of filing some patents later in

448
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,179
attacking the members now it is true to

449
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,220
say that the apache license itself also

450
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,799
has a patent retaliation clause in it

451
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,299
this is beyond the scope of discussing

452
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,830
this afternoon but that wasn't what they

453
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,570
were trying to circumvent here they were

454
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,890
trying to circumvent something actually

455
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,179
more fundamental they were trying to

456
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,230
avoid giving

457
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,470
any rights whatsoever to future patterns

458
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,880
why were they trying to join Apache if

459
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
they wanted that particular sort of

460
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,280
change when I just pick a different

461
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,900
license or go elsewhere they did they

462
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,220
just fail to understand or was there

463
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,230
something more subtle to it I think I

464
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,220
said that that is a fine question so the

465
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,929
company involved is is heavily involved

466
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,200
in other projects at Apache and this was

467
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,669
another project that they were adding to

468
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,890
their portfolio and I have a very strong

469
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,720
suspicion the situation arose because a

470
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,690
new general council had come in and they

471
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,250
hadn't had a general counsel before that

472
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,710
and they had been working on the advice

473
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,140
of external counsel I believe and I

474
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,549
think the general counsel came in and

475
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,200
said you know you're running this ship

476
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,400
you're running here is terrible it's

477
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,660
going to sink you've got to start paying

478
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,820
attention and this was the first case

479
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,280
after the GC had come in I think it was

480
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,620
probably a consequence of that the

481
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,690
company involved was a consistent

482
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,640
contributor at Apache and it continues

483
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,799
to be a consistent contributor and as

484
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,360
you saw at the end of the process they

485
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,559
worked out that they weren't going to

486
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,540
get away with it this time anyway it was

487
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,679
probably something of a learning

488
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,390
experience for the general counsel I

489
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,630
just want to just want to make a comment

490
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,790
that my heart goes out to the poor

491
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,910
engineer because I what I suspect

492
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,980
actually might have been happening was

493
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,620
the general counsel was let me go tell

494
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,809
them I'm going to go in the list and do

495
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,490
it and the engineer was like no wait a

496
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,280
minute no at least you know make some

497
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,650
attempt at the conversation so I you may

498
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,940
have more information from the

499
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,070
experience to know that or not know it I

500
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,169
was just reading them but everything

501
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,000
I've said is all derived from making

502
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
unwarranted assumptions about these

503
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,450
medications on the medic nurse I did

504
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,610
actually write to the people involved on

505
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,690
the mailing list and ask them if they

506
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,980
wanted to explain what was really going

507
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,690
on and they didn't reply to my emails

508
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,230
for some reason

509
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,450
any other questions awesome Thank You

510
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,830
Simon okay

511
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:43,419
