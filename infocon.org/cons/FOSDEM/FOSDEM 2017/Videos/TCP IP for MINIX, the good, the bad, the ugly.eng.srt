 joest there are closed as the mechanics

112
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,649

115
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,550
 it's now or drop back at you get a time out with our macs a series of slap

116
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,959
 anyway this client will point the display to give it up and then set out

117
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,339
 creates a wish you and then the types of listen failed script eye catcher

118
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,290
 view of opens i speak connections and picasa still can't really is implement

119
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,719
 acceptor xlii I recognize that push thumping with cookies

120
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,839
 where you put your to-do list an error descriptors are skippy cow that for

121
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
 connexxion and your money for a new failed script you said you they cookie yes

122
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,310
 what the connection with now and directly move the collection informant falls the

123
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,910
 script to another and that one has the cm effect

124
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,490
 social times but fitting with the framework requires some extra creative

125
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,110
 teach you to get it to work

126
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:25,300
 so this is already so degrees mixed bag or you do with sex placement

127
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,939
 and then you see now yard to do blocking to you and select bandages

128
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:39,180
 backups and us some in jpg file system select then that he stood headpiece

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,359
 operations to wall of script washesaar determined by you may be one

130
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,040
 response what does he have then all of them after the member states that is at

131
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,980
 some point something happened 50 liters for form index free

132
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:01,210
 do you want xlii implemented f&f i complete them with that is your goal

133
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,160
 once some nassau then the pick up once the risks you never huge

134
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,310
 only browse the websites in your center and then in the case of min x

135
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,959
 front drivers and bacon like bc and leads to the flash drive both

136
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,369
 look at this stumping and with eijsink rose to you your dust

137
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,140
 cento starters operations and then you tell the

138
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,209
 application like ok just continue and then all the file system has to

139
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,300
 remember the table like these would and of the operations at there star this en

140
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,339
 in the some point the application can can blog and it does give me the status

141
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,550
 or when of the operations file since to the whistle this he and forget to the

142
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,229
 price of one of them by the first risotto came

143
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,450
 so problem is of course nobody' look cold it seems like you

144
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,470
 what port thumping is non blocks you and select and de

145
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,230
 problem solving is up to you that sucks you do I call the blocks so you go number

146
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,820
 for user food that's again with gesink, you have the free with this

147
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,950

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,840
 verbeek and filter for the beep beep that me and

294
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,570
 we know the game pi-po who are you can do so his caught his finger this

295
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:55,580
 ahead wifi six becomes the tunneling tick locks and then some to that it roll so

296
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,629
 at some point red vp and implementation using the de cm interface

297
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,410
 yes between for minus x so between lot of stuff you know target coast in use of

298
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:15,650
 space and some times we to look at what they freebsd den dool box tunnel in

299
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,970
 we turn off configuration options to wondered why not just around the one

300
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,950
 user food in you then heft all has the complex that in he has go for

301
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,670
 something that seems to be the end of full of the lessons

302
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:38,390
 he thought m riri bed it was me king distributions to cancel your stolk

303
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,520
 and make sure that some bootable images of minus 4 and die were put on so der

304
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,490
 still there after that do you roll it that i clio tests to thumping age would

305
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,810
 i you want to play with that and get my questions or thumpy

306
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:29,850
 the question is about iptables in linux looks like yes he hef

307
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,659
 something similar 250 basics for for implementing a firewall their bed

308
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,350
 so like a set for for doing beep beep et cetera because we do that

309
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,429
 component-based so would he interface that essential

310
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,270
 is 6 tell me something about and extech it

311
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,530
 and then you can get as many bytes if you get for the racks spots them the

312
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:00,240
 site rob or reject orcas and stuff like that end and the action network site

313
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,750
 doesn't have to wait no de policy yes least completely

314
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,070
 in userspace find them too that's my plants for doing your mug and who had and

315
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,070
 shirt people is that the guy how this up to hold

316
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,669
 small tunnel vp and also in the deathly image in san-san parasol

317
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,240
 functionality and then almost started doing a wifi sixt and it was alright

318
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,600
 nobody's i touring eyepiece x1 i love that not a firewall jet so would it

319
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 becoming all light so friends last couple of years that this kind of like mole

320
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,199
 pressing like ok her key you do it for artifice i the fire old to

321
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,040
 make sure that physical he is a firewall that closet for out those four for

322
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,409
 already have that built into a ppm

323
00:27:48,140 --> 00:28:00,440
 yes, that's how we see the system

324
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,610
 so the question is how long does it take to implement

325
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:18,860
 so and also this have last year and it seems that charges basic if they also have internet

326
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:26,689
 ayp ayp ip and tcp up and running to be some way live leemans and what from this

327
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,870
 forty wardens often this out by time to follow the arms iss close as possible at

328
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,969
 it hasn't foresight maybe and the reader about time my modes find it

329
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,950
 en come yes make more sense sam in white by

330
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:50,360
 the some weird stuff yeah and that old catch he did was he fed up point host this

331
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,149
 summary ran on you me content and this must

332
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,320
 crash my site we had beg the crime and that's the kind of stuff that

333
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,480
 you not to really get the box out that license plate loop time so i beg your pardon

334
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:13,550
 I understand the heart with chain out of the box we that she Czech part no more

335
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,300
 questions ardèche

336
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:31,389
 kind or angry and curly lace min x fries silent chips becomes ipad

337
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:38,040
 accept that they never bothered to update this would be the bag and then itv six

338
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,790
 ports apple did that he itv himself

339
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,770
 so do we and that burden is just as

340
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,160
 heibi was my first gosh there it was the fireworks linux

341
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,350
 so that would be the boot garden and thirty was framed and and briefing that it have

342
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,750
 it's in the pass mister's note what that getting ives so many

343
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,020
 other things to do that he that spend a lot of time so would the mainframe

344
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,910
 that ariely this is itv six and get out of this kind of the fire house maybe

345
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,810
 some other small things

346
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:38,220
