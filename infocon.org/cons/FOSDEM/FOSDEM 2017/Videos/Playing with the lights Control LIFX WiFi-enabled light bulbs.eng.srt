1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
my name is Hui we opted this a recent

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,170
software engineer does it really matter

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,269
why I'm I don't really know anything

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,650
about hardware and I think that's what

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,540
we put in part of this talk is I'm

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,980
putting with like hardware devices and

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,410
playing with IOT and I don't really know

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,850
anything about this I'm really just a

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,430
software engineer so if you're gonna

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,550
start number three agenda so this talk

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,439
is going to talk about two related

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,090
projects one is a motor light which is

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,340
any why for like devices like this one

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,420
which is basically like a mattress of

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,140
balance like this okay to control light

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,789
bulbs light bulbs like this guy here I

17
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:52,680
don't know actually this rope that's

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,399
like gonna like it 20 interface and this

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,949
veterinary and then lights D which is

20
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,079
diamond to control the light bulbs so

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,300
this demon close to the eye bulbs expose

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,549
a high level API and I can control that

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,479
the Bible since this way so I'm going to

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,490
first talk about mana right so I could I

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,659
control the bulbs through this like

26
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,330
better Narae I'm gonna give you some

27
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,650
details about the project and then I'm

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,439
going to talk about light Z which was

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,020
actually most of the work which is a

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,729
demon to talk to the bulbs and then

31
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,590
we're gonna maybe some time for the

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,950
discussion so if you're going on a

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,470
styler before you have this high level

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,400
architecture diagram so you can see that

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
moonlight talks to both light Z on the

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,299
pattern array and that's why I control

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,460
the bulbs should here next you see that

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,189
port one is gonna light for to stimulate

39
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,420
Z then on slide number five title model

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,520
right so I just start to be like what

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,530
now what I said a head up to the head

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,439
balance each button has like sixteen

43
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,600
level of brightness this is how I can I

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,579
like you know make make up any right by

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,040
playing with the various levels it's

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,710
connected over serial the next slide I

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,020
was controlling the small table which is

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,600
a

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,740
by this brand curl I fix it's a about a

50
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,780
thousand events bulb so it's pretty high

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,820
brightness inside kissamint watt light

52
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,030
bulb it has nice colors it can be like

53
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,600
all the cores

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,820
it has a nice range of flights from that

55
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,640
keynote 2005 Erland kelvin to like 9,000

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,730
cabin and those lightbulbs are connected

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,870
over Wi-Fi 2.4 gigahertz so the next

58
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,180
slide let's look at the controller right

59
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
so you have the grid so you have like

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,260
this side should be just show a grid

61
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,880
okay and then the next slide you see

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,650
that the brown robe is where like words

63
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,990
and functions so that we get to

64
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,670
functions so for example you know you'll

65
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,700
see have like I can like other functions

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:11,200
I'll show later see ya next I'd like

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,520
shows you like some of the functions

68
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
were like they're mapped black hole

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,600
works you know I could like more things

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,150
to this to this balance black figs and

71
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,070
power control like in your MP day

72
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,520
control other things and then have like

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,400
spread the array into like four control

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,920
pads right so this is like my control

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,990
body here here right and like there is

76
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,890
like four sliders and I'm like some

77
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,090
function all the functions at the top

78
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,300
right so if you're in the next slide you

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:57,070
see like what your starter is okay so so

80
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,590
can I make make it like fullscreen oh

81
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,680
yeah like let's go baby let's do for the

82
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,040
next toy

83
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:18,019
perfect okay okay just just use it here

84
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,220
yeah okay so here okay so like that much

85
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,780
tighter is a key note here and then

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,880
saturation brightness temperature so

87
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,900
that's the HSB K you know color model it

88
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,440
just be and then we have the temperature

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,710
so like you know can increment decrement

90
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,960
so principle I can show this here I turn

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,789
this guy off again I'm gonna rock you

92
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,310
know bring up the brightness which is

93
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,169
here I'm gonna change the color which is

94
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,000
here you can do those two things at the

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,970
same time okay and sound sound can I

96
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,440
make it like less saturated

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,910
right so you're gonna all see like a

98
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:16,150
change color alright so like that was

99
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,979
kinda the more like see okay what are

100
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:28,150
things to say that I'm gonna make a

101
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,590
smoother one that's right that's blue

102
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,220
I'm gonna so like what's interesting is

103
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,919
like the board shows like the the set of

104
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,050
the bobbin act with low light ends here

105
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,759
right that's sort of like a feature of

106
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,449
what I did

107
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,449
it's like it shows really like whether

108
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,919
the status of the Bob is it's not like

109
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,659
you know predicted or something in fact

110
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,210
the real studies of the of the light

111
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,219
bulbs is shown up on the board so for

112
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,880
example if I make it like you know

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,819
transition we can see that the sellers

114
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,530
are moving by themselves right and

115
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,750
that's a program it's just like showing

116
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,340
the real status of the light bulbs right

117
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,479
one more thing like to show is I Cole

118
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,419
interface is that define which i think

119
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,889
is like pretty interesting so I'm gonna

120
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:43,509
go back in to do this like because like

121
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,550
the way this is implemented is in Python

122
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,949
so like the the program that controls

123
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,460
the grid is in Python and the API image

124
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,529
only are pretty high level and the way

125
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,169
you like set your UI element on the grid

126
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,960
is I think pretty interesting it's

127
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,210
pretty high level that's about for like

128
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,310
right on the implementation details

129
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,169
which you'll find on the slides so this

130
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,169
is Python I've been using Python 3.5 and

131
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,700
3.6 with

132
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,980
type annotations which are awesome so

133
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,660
you basically like you know do a type

134
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,550
Python I really encourage you to look

135
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,610
into this if you do Python a lot and

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,610
then I use a circle circle using

137
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,640
synchronous awesome thank you so much so

138
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,750
I'm gonna go on my profile

139
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
so there we go

140
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,259
even architecture by the end that's

141
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,590
pretty awesome

142
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,960
see it's gonna be you I there's like

143
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,590
what I'm using

144
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:09,499
no no so see you guys define right so

145
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,719
like I do her up like a bootlegger

146
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,300
on line 49 and then I can start some

147
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,159
balance the burns have defined actions

148
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,680
in line so she for example like the

149
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,129
other it's you know pink glove which is

150
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:24,650
the effect I did what was moving slowly

151
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,599
there is delayed which is the flashing I

152
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,789
did so she is like defined some parents

153
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,339
say or there are defined reactions it's

154
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,490
very like decorative that's pretty cool

155
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,089
like you're coming back to the

156
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,140
presentation itself okay why it's

157
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,000
lecture maybe one more thing that's

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,490
interesting in the on the movement of

159
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,079
light something I'd like to do next is

160
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,880
that I'm just gonna show them the sides

161
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,800
so imagine we have two functions like

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,949
you know time or another

163
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,360
so we could say like press the timer

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,250
button and then you know you have this

165
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,870
at sharp which is like a timer picker

166
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,269
right would select which time you want

167
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,660
on your timer and then press the target

168
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,149
one chefs act at the time a press an

169
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,470
effect like alert which is the one I

170
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,959
played and flash the Bob with and then I

171
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,660
would like try automatically right so

172
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,010
like one thing I do if I tell Bob's a

173
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,180
lot is I use them as a kitchen timer

174
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,690
over the house the kitchen timer thing

175
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,740
is pretty nice you know it isn't like

176
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,620
Billy like children's okay guys keep

177
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,850
this I talked about it already

178
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,949
I use oh I'm just talking about like

179
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,140
Alton pop-ups I'm using his library to

180
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,620
talk to the billing grid its GPO with me

181
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,649
free I just have to do again skipping

182
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,170
like lights D I'm going to skip this

183
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,440
demo but basically like this is how I

184
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,699
would like to show you the same thing

185
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,949
but can online so show you how to talk

186
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,480
to light Z the demon are controls the

187
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,100
light bulbs which runs directly on the

188
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,829
Wi-Fi access point here

189
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:57,560
um vacuous very high level API in tithe

190
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,360
like you know I should be an example in

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,310
Python again you came just like you know

192
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,529
do at the convention you get back here I

193
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,029
one-niner you get the set of the bulbs

194
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:06,950
another one-liner you can set you know

195
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,860
turn them off do some effects very

196
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,959
simple no discovery delay very high

197
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,529
level okay that's the point project

198
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,760
actually like you know why should you

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,910
suffer under grid is we like a small

200
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,829
amount of the work most of the work was

201
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,540
nicely the other project it's in see

202
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,959
once everywhere details here the

203
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,230
original idea behind lights you were to

204
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,740
remove like discovery device which is

205
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,839
that comes with what the we fix

206
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,899
manufacturer deliver to you with the

207
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,120
light ops basically like the birds are

208
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,089
nice but the surfer stack is soft like

209
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,660
not so not so good got a lot better in

210
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,480
like three years

211
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,130
but like at the beginning it was really

212
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,269
really bad and that's why I start the

213
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,199
project so original ideas like we do

214
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,519
such issues improve the user experience

215
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,500
also a high like security in mine right

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,110
I don't want to have light bulbs on my

217
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,519
back you know whole network I want light

218
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,160
bulbs to be on a separate dedicated

219
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,260
close network I don't want them to other

220
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,699
access to Internet I don't want them to

221
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,070
access anything really right and let's

222
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,990
see by acting as a proxy allows you to

223
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,390
do this right you can isolate the bubble

224
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,820
uh network and use that you as a gateway

225
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,420
to the bombs right so no cloud no ID

226
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,649
required no nothing

227
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,790
I can't you play with me and like

228
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,170
something I have in mind me this project

229
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,699
is also like to make it accessible to

230
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,440
people right this is a personal project

231
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,540
I'm not doing this for like profit and

232
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,899
let me use as part of my company another

233
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,660
entirely personal and I like to make it

234
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,940
accessible so I can have good code our

235
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,880
good practices you know I'll do like

236
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,100
Python 3.26 like you know bleeding edge

237
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,949
stuff so like you know that's an

238
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:59,329
opportunity to do this right

239
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,880
good dogs

240
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,500
on the implementation details for lights

241
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,620
day it uses the light fix as to api's

242
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,500
one is HTTP it goes over the cloud and

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,480
one is like on the local network

244
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,029
it's UDP it's much faster as so much

245
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,329
harder to use separates you all the

246
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,459
communications to the bulbs you know are

247
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,010
you sampling to keep track of the bulbs

248
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,870
right everything is like the bomb

249
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,850
themselves you can like as the state set

250
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,620
their state they're like you know the

251
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,329
protocols can please take this right I

252
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,880
need to like do sampling to like know

253
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,160
what the state of the bugs are right so

254
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,870
I'll just like pull them all the time

255
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,779
right and that's how I get to be have

256
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,649
low latency you can talk to my high-low

257
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,250
very I'll give an API over tcp unix

258
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,800
sockets basically like my API offers you

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,269
like the same kind of functionality you

260
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,850
have with the color api except there is

261
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,070
no cloud right it's so on your local

262
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,010
network on this project and have access

263
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,620
to notes on some fun parts and some like

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,430
you know more like headbanging parts one

265
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,019
point I like to talk about especially is

266
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,149
like what I call like stack position

267
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:15,050
right light Z is actually like soap in

268
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,510
the middle in the stack right on the

269
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,640
left it's like a like you know a lot of

270
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,380
stuff which are like the bulb it's

271
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,920
hardware it's embedded on the right you

272
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,180
have like mono light which is a user

273
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,279
interface it's in Python it's higher

274
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,800
value I it's like you know there is not

275
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,930
much you know system level programming

276
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,370
stuff let's assume everybody's in see

277
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,500
it's pinteresting because it's open up

278
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,120
it opens up to like a wide range of

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,610
topics right by working and like I

280
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,350
didn't know it would go this way when I

281
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,209
said working lights deep but like it

282
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,130
really opened up to a lot of things I

283
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,680
can like either go really deep down and

284
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,750
start doing reverse engineering start

285
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,610
writing like few more bits and like

286
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,170
under lightbulbs and I do like more

287
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,360
hardware related things or I can go very

288
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,399
high level and start like writing G wise

289
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,800
and like very high level code right and

290
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I found this pretty interesting summer

291
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,660
tunnel I fix bulbs I want to share with

292
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,089
you if you like if you wanna get them

293
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,709
get them on sale they're pretty

294
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,100
expensive

295
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,110
I think we still have the best right now

296
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,449
some colors on the market as of today

297
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,250
and the bit like you know their

298
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,709
computers in this you have to keep in

299
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,120
mind there's ten bipolar conception

300
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,529
which is still fairly high

301
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,060
I'm pretty pissed I like you know the

302
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,800
bulbs like saying like here in the on

303
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,319
the box it's activated a when the thing

304
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,910
like you know consumes two watts and

305
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,529
standby

306
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,690
I mean if you have like you know like

307
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,630
ten light bulbs you have like it stuck

308
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,199
if you had always one fully fully turned

309
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,610
on they have a cool an API and I think

310
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,560
they are the only vendor to do this and

311
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,149
it's pretty cool I give me like hope

312
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,670
they keep it it's pretty nice

313
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,829
they're not super made to happen about

314
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,180
it but they're not really closed about

315
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,250
they either right one thing though is

316
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,660
only the first generation of bubs

317
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,269
doesn't crash for me right everything

318
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,649
they mail after this and they're in

319
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,920
generation three basically crashes right

320
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,779
they have like I could go into the

321
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,040
dissolve abyss but there's some Wi-Fi

322
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,990
conditions which always happened to me

323
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,300
up and up which always happen for me the

324
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,089
web crashes unfortunately so really what

325
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,040
am I to say about this is like binary

326
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,120
blobs suck

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,699
really I love to be able to get access

328
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,800
to the ephemeral source code and like be

329
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,750
able to like have something more up in

330
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,579
there so I could like debug and

331
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,690
eventually fix what's going to like I

332
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,339
have the opportunity to action on this

333
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,889
right or replace their stuff with my own

334
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,940
stuff like this right so really again

335
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,850
like you know free software convention

336
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,660
binary blobs suck

337
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,529
still the case

338
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,980
[Applause]

339
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,390
thank you

340
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,320
other things I want to do on this

341
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,120
project you know do time-based release

342
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,520
improvise share information do bellicose

343
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,510
and enforcement surveys you like might

344
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,610
enlarge the maintain to version of the

345
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,320
lightbulbs one which is the reality and

346
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,560
one which is what I want and because

347
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,200
it's like all every junkie you know

348
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,840
light see we like always try to make

349
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,240
that's supposed to be the loyalty right

350
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,280
so like I have two views and I probably

351
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,550
one on top of each other and then with

352
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,650
this be able to be a real cool like

353
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,080
effects API not effects plug-in they're

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,240
like really reliable right and stuff

355
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,000
like this other things I like to do it

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
but I'm you know I will never do I have

357
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,770
time but horror like if other people

358
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,300
want to like you know like something I

359
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,250
love to do is like be able to like debug

360
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,690
the fuelers and I have access to the

361
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,170
film worse just make it easier for me to

362
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,870
like reverse-engineer the API stuff like

363
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,280
this they'll be awesome that's about it

364
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,329
we have like a minute left for

365
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,720
discussion and questions so like please

366
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,180
go ahead don't be shy

367
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,410
otherwise I'd like a side okay one

368
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,449
question here yes connect with the

369
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,609
supplier can you repeat the question yes

370
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,500
so I've I've been in contact with with

371
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,480
the supplier about my project yes

372
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,260
actually yes and they recognized that

373
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,200
for example the crashes and they they

374
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,670
say that affects a small amount of

375
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,070
people but certainly affects me very

376
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,780
pretty nice they were really care about

377
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,370
the project because I'm doing something

378
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,980
which is like completely different from

379
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,840
like their product right there polo is

380
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,150
cloud it works in like mobile I'm doing

381
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,530
a demon and see that you have to install

382
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,720
somewhere right I make it as easy as

383
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,490
possible that's some point you're gonna

384
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,840
have to run an app get or you're gonna

385
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,330
have to like use append ability and I

386
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,740
can put it somewhere in a raspberry pie

387
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,870
whatever you want but you have to open a

388
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,400
Hutu and type some comments right so

389
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,260
they're not simple delivery interested

390
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,700
right I believe and like I do you

391
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,800
understand this I saw these questions

392
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,270
are clearly not interested in opening

393
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,090
that framework

394
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,340
any other question well thank you so

395
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,050
much

396
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:32,329
