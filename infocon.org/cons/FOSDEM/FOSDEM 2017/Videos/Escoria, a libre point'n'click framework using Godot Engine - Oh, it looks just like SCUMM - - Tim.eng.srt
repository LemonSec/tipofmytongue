1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,389
have the

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,069
I mean financial help for having him

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,790
coming here but else he would have come

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,200
and certainly with he would have spoken

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,309
[Music]

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,199
to to do so but yes you know it was

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
impossible maybe next year

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:39,330
thank you hello everyone and welcome to

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,890
this presentation where I will be

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,320
talking today about a scoria framework

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,120
which is a label point-and-click

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,160
framework using the dough engine that

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,750
allows you to make adventure point and

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,130
click games so first of all what is this

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,560
Korea s Korea is basically a set of

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,680
tools and scripts built on top of coder

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,470
engine Godot engine I will be eternally

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,519
talking about it in the next slide the

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,170
this framework

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,390
aim and aims at providing a basic

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,090
workflow for whole team to build an

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,219
adventure graphic game

23
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,149
ud based on top of it to the so it

24
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,270
provides multiple tools such as the esc

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,159
scripting language that i will be

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,329
talking a bit later too

27
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:26,939
and just know that it's meant to be a

28
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,490
tool for either four teams to adapt and

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,380
built on top of it or for indie

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,719
developers in the also alone so what is

31
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,600
Korea is not first of all it's not an

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,090
only one product such as you can know

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,249
with Visionnaire or Adventures game

34
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,770
studio which isn't a complete solution

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,049
to that allows you to do to create such

36
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,259
games this is not exactly the Navi idea

37
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,869
so it's not exactly a user-friendly

38
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,179
product you will have to adapt and know

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,159
the framework no-gooder engine because

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,319
you will be using good ranging

41
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,859
extensively it's also not make your game

42
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,840
without programming solution so it's not

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,169
like RPG maker stuff that allows you to

44
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,150
put your assets and just move them by

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,700
clicking and dragging them

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,620
the way you want it's not exactly that

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,900
ghetto engine allows you to do so but

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,950
this is not exactly the purpose of

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,349
s.korea framework engine which some of

50
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,110
you may already know and if not you're

51
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,450
welcome to over to our booth in the H

52
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,180
building which is a full-featured Engine

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,940
2d and 3d that allows you to create your

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,720
games it's not a library that because it

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,430
takes over your entry point main loop

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,190
inputs shaders it allows you to create

57
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,900
the whole stuff that you put into it

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,900
again and organize your your stuff in

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,930
nodes into the same tree model that you

60
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,810
have an illustration here by the jetty

61
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,600
sweetie from some epic unreal who a

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,880
little comparison between the the way

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,459
the scene is there is organized in other

64
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,290
engines and the one in in Godot as you

65
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,110
can see here in other engines you put

66
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,239
all your assets in the biggest sea and

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,970
organize them and them inside in Godot

68
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,489
you just create your scene and you split

69
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,410
them in sub scenes which you don't you

70
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,250
split up again

71
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,180
in even smaller sub scenes that you can

72
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,850
use in other scenes so you can you have

73
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,140
since reusable and easier to maintain

74
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,700
that's the end of the basic ID and of

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,310
course go to engine is fully open source

76
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,400
and MIT licensed so back to us Korea

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
framework again there's already one

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,570
professional game that uses a scoria

79
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,980
framework it began it began with the

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,700
development of the demo in 2012 showing

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,209
a classic point-and-click gameplay and

82
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,150
just just to say that most of the team

83
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,959
was from most of the members of the

84
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,609
development team it was the first time

85
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,470
making a game

86
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,080
they had six core members and there were

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,959
12 in total finally the game was

88
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,890
kick-started in November 2014 and we

89
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,510
barely made at 30k and the game was

90
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,200
finally published and it's no no

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,850
since about one year on Steam just a

92
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,280
word about tools in game development

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,950
every game whatever they can the jar or

94
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,190
the type when it comes to a certain

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,990
complexity will have its custom tools

96
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,240
that's the case with adventure tools the

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,150
adventure game sorry but when it comes

98
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,550
to professional teams making a game you

99
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,560
are generally distinguished two main

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,650
groups of people for the artists and

101
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,400
then the game designers so we need in

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,070
this case a tool that allows both groups

103
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,820
to work together so we need a tool that

104
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,980
allows special specialization for the

105
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,900
artist and for and for the game

106
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,140
designers and also assigning tasks away

107
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,760
from the develop from the programmers so

108
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,580
you don't have bottlenecks having

109
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,940
programmers artists or game designers

110
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,370
needing some specific tools waiting for

111
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,270
the programmers to program them and

112
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,440
having to wait for the programmers to

113
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,930
finish the job before they can at last

114
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,030
starting to other work so the

115
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,010
programmers have to build the framework

116
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,040
first which is the purpose of his Korea

117
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,330
program is solve the other problem with

118
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,729
the code and the code halfbacks so we

119
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,080
want to avoid having to create code as

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,640
much as possible during the game

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,210
development process also programmers are

122
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,370
25 percent more expensive according to

123
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,310
Guinness cetera which means it's it may

124
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,280
be interesting to value using them as as

125
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,979
much as possible as an example

126
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,210
Doug Mendoza has 20 as fear 15k assets

127
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,030
which means there is a really need in

128
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,270
this kind of game adventure games for

129
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,180
artists to to put their assets and

130
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,889
creation in in the game so what are the

131
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,560
artists need exactly they need to be

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,690
responsible for the creation of them the

133
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,639
usage of their assets from the beginning

134
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,180
from the blank page to the to the indie

135
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,220
game until the game is completely

136
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,289
finished so yeah they need to have the

137
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,660
control of the use of their assets into

138
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,699
the game engine that's the purpose of

139
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,510
the other engine which allows that they

140
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,210
they have no dependency on programmers

141
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,639
on almost in the case of a video game

142
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,789
artists they are not simple artists on

143
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,669
blank pages they also they of course

144
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:04,789
draw their images and textures and 3d

145
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,039
models but not just for the beauty of it

146
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,080
they have to use it in video games

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,710
that's their medium so they can express

148
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,020
themselves on the middle of a video game

149
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,460
if they can and if the environment

150
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,470
allows them to do so then you get a

151
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,650
better product in the end

152
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,560
in the case of game designers the their

153
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,840
needs is a bit unclear they need to

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,789
accept the input the influence of the

155
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,419
game logic but not too much because they

156
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,300
are they will add much imagining and

157
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,699
much thing and even more and the game

158
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,770
the game will never the game development

159
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,560
would never end but they need the 2 that

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,380
is complex enough enough to allow us to

161
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,169
surprises and be able to make things

162
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,320
that we don't think the framework or the

163
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,370
game engine would be able to do

164
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,599
basically then we believe of design

165
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
tools to allow them to build the scenes

166
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,690
the rules and stuff like that also

167
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,849
dialogue and dialogue writing in the

168
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,160
form of dialogue trees and get some

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,460
scripting not as movie script as

170
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,419
experiment

171
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,810
not as computer script that is no sole

172
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,900
source code we want them to write a

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,479
story and make to make the gameplay upon

174
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,370
it in the case of level design you can

175
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,280
we can use game a given engine with us

176
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,589
courier to do so it's a bit similar to

177
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,990
the artist because they can put the

178
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,208
assets together to create and organize

179
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,000
the the elements of the mat of the map

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,870
or the room by creating a technical

181
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,200
specification and keep it flexible the

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,260
engine tools allow that so they have

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,500
they are forced to learn the tool and it

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,630
allows them in later to keep the Edit

185
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:03,050
and test cycle very fast ESC language

186
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,510
which is this is the language is

187
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,589
provided by s.korea framework and that

188
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,380
that is used for cutscene scripting it's

189
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,880
made mostly for the dialogues and the

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,010
reactions of them and the NPCs to some

191
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,790
actions of the player and it's a

192
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,180
generally or generally or they get the

193
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,420
translation of the of the game history

194
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,660
of the engine frames we don't want the

195
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,149
game designer to take care of about the

196
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,899
technical stuff and take care about how

197
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,329
how it shows does it take time do we

198
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,459
have data at the time how many frames

199
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,769
per second etc we don't care about that

200
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,790
and let's just let's just them they just

201
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,310
have to do their job and the technical

202
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,790
part is the programmers part this

203
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,140
language allows the description of

204
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,750
complex dialogue to directories in that

205
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,199
it's simply a basic logic workflow since

206
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,940
it's not Turing complete it does not

207
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,930
provide any operator no for loops no

208
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,830
no if statement and so on it only

209
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,680
manages boolean values to do the job and

210
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,230
it's sufficient it's enough easy for

211
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,120
them to be able to be able to write what

212
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,800
they need and powerful enough to do to

213
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,130
do this kind of adventure adventure game

214
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,589
just for the story mr. Tim Schafer the

215
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,200
Creator well-known for day of the

216
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
tentacle games and also grim fandango at

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,130
in the LucasArts games visited the team

218
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,500
members of the Dublin dollar game and

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,200
when he was presented with the ESC

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,350
language had this word wow it looks just

221
00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:00,690
like scum so again about about the ESC

222
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,000
language it is real men from for

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,779
non-programmers

224
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,029
game designers are not always

225
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,490
programmers they need to control the

226
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,860
game logic in complex ways and complex

227
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,470
ways just to push the limits and allow

228
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,800
them to for all of them for better

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,020
creation but not too complex because if

230
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,380
you add more complexity than you are you

231
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,270
can add more bugs and if you need such

232
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,440
complexity then you you should give this

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,290
task to the programmer itself and let me

234
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,980
do the job but in that way the

235
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,390
programmers should just keep his eye on

236
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,680
the under project and be just the frame

237
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,160
around the creator's not be an obstacle

238
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,100
and what everyone needs in the can in

239
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,230
the task of creation of adventure games

240
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,870
here is always to keep a version of the

241
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,240
beta rentable at all times you don't

242
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,180
want to have the game created in the

243
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,829
editor then start it over and start with

244
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,459
the compilation testing we mark the bed

245
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,889
correct array compiled and so one

246
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,170
multiple times until the job is done

247
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,290
so that's the purpose here of the

248
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,569
avocado engine again because there is no

249
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,339
such compilation process another

250
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,230
advantage of the avocado engine here

251
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,790
with s.korea

252
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,110
is that the vessels are independent with

253
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,470
each other that is you can run one scene

254
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,550
alone so that the team that you can be

255
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,250
split up in to work on the different

256
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,970
scenes and each scene is is meant to be

257
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,459
a little game in turn in itself and the

258
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,949
whole scenes the whole set of things put

259
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:55,740
together gives the final game at the end

260
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,810
just a word about using user friendly

261
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,690
versus productive question this

262
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,610
framework here was made for a

263
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,250
professional team it has been released

264
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,030
in the MIT license there very recently

265
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,890
but it was meant for a professional team

266
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,280
which got paid money of course and they

267
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,990
absolutely didn't absolutely don't care

268
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,680
about having a pretty UI and magnificent

269
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,370
tool that shiny and so easy to use our

270
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,280
steep learning curve and if they do they

271
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,630
I get they get paid money to did not

272
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,640
care so it's up to you the programmer to

273
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,100
make it easy for them to use your your

274
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,930
framework so they can be productive and

275
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,270
you don't have to convince them to use

276
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,560
it in such it has two takes and you I do

277
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,950
have a value but the value of the of the

278
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,470
team that creates the game is

279
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,690
productivity and not user friendliness

280
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,530
that's why we focused they focused on

281
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,560
the use of on the creation of the

282
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,450
framework using google engine and not

283
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:09,530
having a whole solution all-in-one the

284
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,450
tools are very important to allow all

285
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,060
the programmers to work and contribute

286
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,370
to the game together to remove the whole

287
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,620
process the programmer has to be has to

288
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,960
be just a frame around them around the

289
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,350
core team it's not it's not VMT and

290
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,320
three point for any task of the audio of

291
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,110
the whole team because in this case it

292
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,640
would occur there but at the bottleneck

293
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,930
which we want to avoid the two artists

294
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,180
are generally straightforward and most

295
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,630
angel provides them so you want to make

296
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,390
artist firstly use them and make

297
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,490
programmers out of the way only you help

298
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,950
them when the when they need it not

299
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,060
having the artist go to the programmer

300
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,650
finally the tools for the game designers

301
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,780
are a bit trickier they can use the same

302
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,910
but it's all effectively a middle ground

303
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,210
between the programmer and the artist so

304
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,420
you

305
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,400
have to find a good balance and that's

306
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,290
the the idea between the use of total

307
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,219
you good arranging thank you

308
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,550
I just wanted to add that tomorrow and

309
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,350
and the day after we will have be having

310
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,930
the first double cone here in Brussels

311
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,149
which will takes place take place at the

312
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,940
hackers place a cure space near the

313
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,230
center of Brussels so you're all welcome

314
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,399
if you want to join us we will be

315
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,670
talking about Google ad contributions

316
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,790
talk about the new documentation crash

317
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,870
course isn't maybe it's so you are

318
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,750
welcome if you if you want any questions

319
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,020
[Applause]

320
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,240
[Music]

321
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,050
you don't have to worry about the about

322
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,680
the interaction because they are all

323
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,870
managed directly by them by the

324
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,449
framework first that goes into the into

325
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,149
the ghetto engine which K which is the

326
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:31,829
second layer so you absolutely don't

327
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:34,199
absolutely don't have to worry about it

328
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,259
left click for example manages the

329
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,089
movements of the other characters the

330
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:41,939
actions are already managed also and you

331
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:45,120
just have to you just have to take care

332
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,100
about the elements that you put on on

333
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,120
the screen and the actions are connected

334
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,310
very easily using the framework you just

335
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,199
have to connect the scripts the current

336
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,319
of the correct scripts into you get your

337
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,300
your objective and elements in your

338
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,819
scene and the framework does the rest

339
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,450
how do these brotherly other times what

340
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,230
I do well if you need an extension about

341
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,660
the the framework right depressions

342
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,680
because the microphone well you're

343
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,440
talking about the the inter interaction

344
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,160
and the fact that you need to manage

345
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
more thing that the the framework could

346
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,980
actually do but then in this case you

347
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,370
can extend the the escrow yeah for more

348
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,950
very easily because it's developed in GD

349
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,870
script which is the the in Erlang

350
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,850
language scripting language of the other

351
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,610
the engine so you simply you can of

352
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,300
course adapt the the inner scripts

353
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,060
included in the us-korea frameworks to

354
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,070
fit your needs if it's needed of course

355
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,580
yeah

356
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:21,730
yes it has no because it's decided then

357
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,320
yeah concerning the considering the the

358
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,649
decision of I'm sorry on I scheduled a

359
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,929
trip it again because I almost forgot

360
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:37,440
the question sir sorry

361
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,759
the need of adding the design has an

362
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,600
impact on the the others on the other

363
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:10,059
members of the team may be not really

364
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,059
actually they're in this kind of problem

365
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,639
to make things simpler in the in the

366
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:17,889
framework the framework is designed to

367
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:22,379
be as simple as possible so you don't

368
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,129
generally have to make things different

369
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:29,309
you can use it as a you can use it as is

370
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,470
and it generally will fit the needs of a

371
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,600
basic adventure pointing pointing to

372
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,869
games so if you if you really have new

373
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,450
new designing needs it's not a problem

374
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,909
you can add new a new script 16 if it's

375
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,239
needed

376
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,380
yes looking at the Astoria github repo

377
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,090
it looks like there was this massive

378
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:08,140
first comment five months ago yeah so

379
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,220
concerning the current state of the

380
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,680
korea framing a framework on the github

381
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,340
repo effectively the the Astoria

382
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,320
framework was developed first for the

383
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,930
Dublin Taos our game just at the

384
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,880
beginning of the development then it was

385
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,710
released and freed open source very

386
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,540
recently so for now no no one is working

387
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,840
on it to maintain it I intend to want to

388
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,300
work on it and maintain it and add some

389
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,070
and some new features in it

390
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,920
I worked personally on a little

391
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,500
framework on my on my own before s.korea

392
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,390
was out so I I'm I mean I need to add

393
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,310
some of the features I created to

394
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,770
simplify some of them a lot of other

395
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,110
stuff that s Korea provides for example

396
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,750
you know if you want to define the area

397
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,340
of the clickable items you have for the

398
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,380
moment in your in s Korea you have to

399
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:15,170
use masks in images engine provides a

400
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,940
simple way to avoid this and do

401
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,790
everything directly in Google so you can

402
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,180
avoid having to create image masks of

403
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,970
your scene to to allow the user to to

404
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,750
select the selecting an area of the item

405
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,810
plus if this area is incorrect you have

406
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,510
to modify this image if you are select

407
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,360
and define the area directly directly in

408
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,010
the editor then you don't need to create

409
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,380
to remake the image one more time that's

410
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,840
the idea of things I want to simplify

411
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,790
and other Cerf I have ideas on

412
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,550
especially for the creation of s.korea

413
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,220
scripts and ESC scripts which are

414
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,150
currently text-based I think we can I

415
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,340
think I'm able to

416
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,280
to create a tool that allows you to make

417
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,490
your dialogue trees like bright graph

418
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,020
based I created as the start of our work

419
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,020
off from my own project which is not

420
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,230
finished yet but I intend to may to make

421
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,500
it and put it into an into his cornea

422
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,940
framework system requirements I think

423
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,400
you need a pretty fast graphical

424
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,340
workstation to run yeah good is very

425
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,630
very big very big workstation as an

426
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,180
example the main developer of avocado

427
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,700
engine works in a very low-end computer

428
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,830
so depending on the complexity and the

429
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,350
need of graphics the option after

430
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,810
production then you may need a very

431
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,580
important very important configuration

432
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,670
so it's pretty it runs perfectly well on

433
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,050
very low-end pcs so no need for hire not

434
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,710
specifically except you're doing very

435
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,930
important graphics change shading and

436
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,160
this kind of stuff you know

437
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,200
like Intel HD 3000 graphics on their

438
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:25,980
life so this is some a lot of people are

439
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,720
using very low end graphics and almost

440
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,820
non-existent graphic cards to make their

441
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,420
games yep in simply Intel in internal

442
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,460
internal chipset what's there well yes

443
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:49,170
most adventure games you have a story

444
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,880
that goes from point A to point B and

445
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,100
you have like just like a single ending

446
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,030
like branching path this is like support

447
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,000
it in your framework or that's up to you

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,070
that's up to you because you are the

449
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,750
game designer so you have to design the

450
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,010
game the way you want

451
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,890
that's the per the idea behind the ESC

452
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,140
language that allows you to create

453
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,600
multiple endings if you if you want

454
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,150
depending depending on the only actions

455
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,090
of the other player say if he finds an

456
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,790
item or not he gets one ending or the

457
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,150
other that's up to you to design this

458
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,530
when you're when you're designing the

459
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:35,220
game at the first time to write some

460
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,960
kind of branching scripts you can do

461
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,590
visual novels yeah you can you can do

462
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,750
this kind of branching using the the ESC

463
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,210
language branching like in in certain

464
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,330
games that came out very recently and

465
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,809
visual novels it's absolutely possible

466
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,420
to to make with ESC language yes

467
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,510
you stop there thank you so much

468
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:06,049
[Applause]
