1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,590
my name is Wayne Stan ball I'm currently

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,990
the kicad project leader talk today a

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,120
little bit about the current status of

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,309
kicad where we're at right now where

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,680
we'd like to go in the next stable

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,470
version I'm going to change my format a

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,110
little bit this year black the last two

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,700
years I've kind of done adjust I talked

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,080
at you it's gonna be a little bit more

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,580
of a show-and-tell

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,980
I'm just picked I kind of cherry picked

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,230
some of the bigger highlights of the

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,780
upcoming stable release and trying to

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,129
kind of left a little bit of the more

15
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,950
detailed stuff out so I can get through

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,090
a little bit a little bit quicker

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,530
because in the past there's been so many

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,590
questions so without further adieu and

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,600
of course it's gonna make a look what's

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,680
going on here my computer's ok cut

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,170
project status hopefully stable release

22
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,930
5 will happen soon I'd like I'm hoping

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,700
in the next month or two we're gonna be

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,430
ready to branch and then start you know

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,570
final bug fixing so the goal is sometime

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,549
around summer see how that works in

27
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,950
practice anybody who's ever you know

28
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,780
done an open source project knows that

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,330
that doesn't always work that way the

30
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,090
developed the version 6 development

31
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,799
roadmap is complete if you want to go

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,869
see that it's online on the kicad

33
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,130
website we have seen a increased

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,659
interest in user interest than from the

35
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,110
downloads that are from our website

36
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,380
increased commercial interest and I was

37
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,380
told earlier when I'm talking to haviar

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,840
that there was a sudden spike in

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,180
donations and if people who aren't know

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,369
the whole situation situation with Eagle

41
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,990
know probably when that happened and why

42
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,710
it happened so that's a good thing thank

43
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,420
you eagle yeah I'm not gonna complain

44
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,030
and this year we first for the first

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,939
time we had two hackathons some of us

46
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,500
were at CERN over the summer and July

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,150
for a week and then there was another

48
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,520
hackathon in the fall at Brazil in

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,780
Brazil and I don't normally like to give

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,810
too many commercial people credit but if

51
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,530
I don't know if you were familiar

52
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,750
somebody had hijacked a long time ago

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,330
kicad org we didn't get the domain

54
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,290
somebody else

55
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,510
took it from us and we said we weren't

56
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,400
going to pay the money because we'd have

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,900
money to pay to get the domain back but

58
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,989
digi-key graciously bought the domain

59
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,299
paid the five grand to purchase from

60
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,250
whoever had it and wanted that money for

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,239
it and they redirected kicad or to the

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,890
website so now when you type in kicad

63
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,409
org yeah thank you thank you beauty

64
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,799
right there you know they're under no

65
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,629
obligation to do that for us and you

66
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,489
know but I talked to their their people

67
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,680
and their yeah no problem it was very

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
very cordial so keep that in mind when

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,040
you're ordering parts from somebody oh

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,590
it's gonna be slow today isn't it yes it

71
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,400
is okay come on where's the first page

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,129
of course it goes to okay stable five

73
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,290
release and new features the big stuff

74
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,209
okay I know technically the first one is

75
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,480
not kicad but for all the people who

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,859
develop on kicad that was probably more

77
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,909
important and everything else we've done

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,560
I'm not gonna go over this the next one

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
because Tomas did a really nice

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,609
presentation earlier on the ngspice

81
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,269
integration into kicad if you want to go

82
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,409
take a look at that you can go look at

83
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,269
the video it's it's really nice if you

84
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,220
have not a chance to use it if you're if

85
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,650
you're a splice user I highly recommend

86
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,750
you try it okay so let's get into some

87
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,819
of the stuff that happened here we have

88
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,239
a few simple things here one of these is

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,970
the schematic editor tool like so one of

90
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,079
the things that you know it's easy to

91
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,560
get you know your fields lined up very

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,269
simple tool is the splice the new

93
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,709
alignment tool you just hover over and

94
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,079
hit o or you want to do the context menu

95
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,669
you can do that too

96
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,250
it's just a new tool that happened to be

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,810
thrown together by one of our guys as a

98
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,340
cheap and dirty who was tired of hand

99
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,139
you know trying to you know change the

100
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,940
grid size and place everything so that's

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,228
that's a nice new feature that we have

102
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,620
Oh

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,990
the next one is the you also just saw

104
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,160
that um you see there's a net highlight

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
here in pink so if I go over here and

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,569
click on the net highlighting tool and I

107
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,300
click on a different net or a different

108
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,639
wire it'll and it also works for

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,169
hierarchy so if you you know if you're

110
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,300
one of those guys has a a big sheet with

111
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,610
you know and you just use labels instead

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,560
of actual wires it'll highlight the

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,879
labels too so like if there's one over

114
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,990
here inside the page and one on that

115
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,569
side of page they'll turn pink and so

116
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,129
now it's not hooked up to the board

117
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,409
editor that's coming up in the next

118
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,479
version so that's a new feature in the

119
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,069
schematic editor one of the other new

120
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,039
things in the schematic editor that was

121
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm not going to go over that there's a

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,520
regular expression search live you know

123
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,240
when you're searching through the

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,159
library you pick a symbol to put in your

125
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,099
schematic editor so rather clever it's a

126
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,870
combination of type as you go old

127
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,539
wildcard searching matching and regular

128
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:22,979
expression it looks at the whole thing

129
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,380
and picks the best combination of rich

130
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,990
but you know queries that it gets and

131
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,880
then that's what you see in this symbol

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
list so so for you know probably only us

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,240
geeks will care about regular expression

134
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,289
searching but it's there

135
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,870
if you if you want to use it another

136
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,819
what requested feature is when you can

137
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,719
now directly out update the board from

138
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,039
the schematic editor in other words

139
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,110
there's no intermediate netlist file you

140
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,330
can you can still generate it it's just

141
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,580
it's now transparent it's actually sent

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,520
through an internal communications bus

143
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,039
from the board to the schematic and it

144
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,810
looks a little something like this you

145
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,569
go in here and you go into the Tools

146
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,870
menu and update PCB from schematics and

147
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,909
you'll see the schematic since I didn't

148
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,169
make any changes there were no changes

149
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,909
and then you can perform the update you

150
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,949
can say yeah I accept them or no I don't

151
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,990
and then it'll make any changes to your

152
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,419
board so now it's transparent so when I

153
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,060
hit perform PCB any changes that are in

154
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,219
that list are gonna be made to my board

155
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,719
so there's no intermediate you don't

156
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,759
have to save the netlist till file go

157
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,460
into the board editor open the new you

158
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,710
know re-import the netlist and then go

159
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,030
through this iteration

160
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,110
sure sure yeah it has a converse too

161
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,940
which is rather nice we you can also go

162
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,050
the other way when you have the Bordeaux

163
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,970
editor open and I'll talk about that a

164
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,620
little bit it kind of works in both

165
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,200
directions there so that's that one

166
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,120
probably the single biggest user change

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,100
that you'll see this year is the 3d

168
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
editor was completely rewritten and it

169
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,090
brought a lot of things along with it

170
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,700
that are really nice I know ray tracing

171
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,430
is eye candy most people unless you're

172
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,410
you know creating brochures or something

173
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,510
like that you probably don't care but I

174
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,220
don't know if anybody any of you have

175
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,650
seen what some of the results of our ray

176
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,120
tracing are and I don't know how good

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,400
this is gonna look here but if you look

178
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,580
at some of the if you have really high

179
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,650
well you know in all fairness you have

180
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,330
to have really high quality models for

181
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,670
that to happen you just can't take

182
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,780
run-of-the-mill models you got to do all

183
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,640
the texturing but if you're dedicated

184
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,680
enough and you're ambitious enough you

185
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
can get these kind of results so yeah so

186
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,050
and I know it's just kind of eye candy

187
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,190
and I'm not gonna do it live here

188
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,140
because this computer is too slow if

189
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,430
you've know anything about ray tracing

190
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,940
it can take a while so so that's a nifty

191
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,870
little feature we got one the other nice

192
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,440
thing about the 3d viewer is it we used

193
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,030
it brought in step the the developer who

194
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,860
did it did a nice plug-in system so now

195
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,710
we can import you know not just our VRML

196
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,480
VRML models we can also import step so

197
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,580
which also gave us direct export to step

198
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,010
once we had basically we can import step

199
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,840
models and and flip them around you can

200
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,390
now from the board editor edit to step

201
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,860
and I'll show you here's a simple board

202
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,230
that I did some of these are oh man it

203
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,820
looks terrible on this no it's probably

204
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,840
as a resolution only one of these

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,490
components on this board is a step model

206
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,490
the rest time are VRML so when you do

207
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,580
the export you will see something like

208
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,909
we're free CAD here now I mean it where

209
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,570
is it there and so that's a step model

210
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,550
that's to scale so if you wanted to

211
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,750
implicit you were putting that in an

212
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,580
enclosure you can pull it in

213
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,530
you're whatever solid modeling package

214
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,960
you use for you know hardware

215
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,730
development and use that model and

216
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,160
that's a step model so we now have

217
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,900
because that is a really highly

218
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,910
requested feature for a long time so so

219
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,880
that's that was the the 3d viewer bought

220
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,550
us all that so we also now support

221
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,310
rounded rectangle you know our Pat we in

222
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,840
the past we've only just had pure

223
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,540
rectangles we now support rectangular or

224
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,750
rounded rectangular one of the one of

225
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,580
the old things that were left over from

226
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,930
the good old days when you would the

227
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,400
first time you open you know imported

228
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
your netlist or a board all the

229
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,340
footprints will be laying on top of each

230
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,270
other and you had to spread them out

231
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,100
manually and people who know are

232
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,720
currently using the version four know

233
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,940
that there's now when you import a

234
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,520
middle it'll just it'll expand them it

235
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,720
won't try to put them in any particular

236
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,100
order but they won't be laying on top of

237
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,820
each other anymore

238
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,800
so they'll it's easier to move them

239
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,440
around the other thing is now that we

240
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,080
can if you we can go to the other

241
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,730
direction so if you go from if you're

242
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,960
thinning the schematic editor and you

243
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,430
made some changes to your or in the

244
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,200
board editor and you made some changes

245
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,160
to your schematic you can come here and

246
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,760
say yeah pull it and I see the exact

247
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,290
same dialogue it just came the other way

248
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,490
this time it went and query the

249
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,110
information in the schematic editor and

250
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,940
said okay what do I need to make change

251
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,740
in the board what edits have I made and

252
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,960
that's the so it's bi-directional which

253
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,150
is rather which is convenient for users

254
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,669
[Music]

255
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,019
no no it starts to go backwards yet no

256
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,579
that's gonna be the net yeah we'll talk

257
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,420
about that and that's version six baby

258
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,740
steps baby steps the gal canvas is now

259
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,110
this was a requested feature if you go

260
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,100
into the View menu

261
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,069
this is top side look into the board

262
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,750
from the top side to the backside which

263
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,399
is normally you know the normal view not

264
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,970
we now have a flip view so you can look

265
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,319
at it from the back side because

266
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,269
sometimes when you're bored okay well

267
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,350
sometimes when you're bored you know

268
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,180
it's hard laying on board it's hard to

269
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,769
look through the board and see because

270
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,629
the backsides mirrored so you yes well

271
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,129
now you can flip it now that's looking

272
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,050
from the back side of the the back side

273
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,759
to the front side flip this way like if

274
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,300
I just took this board and went that's

275
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,019
before you couldn't do that you always

276
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,990
had to work from the top through so

277
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:37,750
that's new there's a checkbox it tells

278
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,809
you you're in flip view but no I

279
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,759
this computer doesn't show that very

280
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,559
well but that we put there's anti

281
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,990
anti-aliasing support for the OpenGL

282
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,319
canvas so like when you see the the net

283
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,839
names on the traces there they're just

284
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,000
smoother looking now it's the text the

285
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,639
text is rendered with if you're you know

286
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,740
your graphics card supports it we now

287
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,779
have anti LSD support Gerber x2

288
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,889
extensions

289
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,480
Gerber's desperately trying to stay

290
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,069
relevant I don't know how familiar you

291
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,360
are with them but you can embed things

292
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,759
like to stack up you know your layer

293
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,769
stacks in writing your Gerber files now

294
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,170
there we are as far as I know I don't

295
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,579
know if anybody else has even done it

296
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,519
because jean-pierre sharad the founder

297
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,670
the original founder of the project he

298
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,170
has a close working relationship with

299
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,259
you Camco and i think we're the first

300
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,430
project to offer xt support directly and

301
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,230
now the people the person Shover out are

302
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,059
now in the past it like when you were

303
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,329
shoving stuff around sometimes you you

304
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,980
didn't get the clearance around your

305
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,319
traces so if for some reason you

306
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,459
couldn't route something through

307
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:50,829
because you were you were violating your

308
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,319
clearances there you actually see the

309
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,459
clearance now on the push and shove

310
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,139
router the legacy always had that you

311
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,800
could see where the the the clearance

312
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,720
was so that's the new features okay it's

313
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,670
going to be slow what's it doing okay

314
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,110
some improvements I'm going to not go

315
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,550
over too many of these we got some new

316
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,970
bitmaps and the launcher the schematic

317
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,550
editor configuration is now a unified

318
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,589
tab boring and a dialog it's cleaned up

319
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:24,879
we stabbed like three or four different

320
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,040
ways like color settings there on a

321
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,949
single dialog now it's much cleaner a

322
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,339
simple other library that's not here's

323
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,369
we are library editing we know as week

324
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,499
our library management tools are a

325
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,209
little weak so we're in the process of

326
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,369
working on that we changed the Python

327
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,749
shell from pie crust which is just a

328
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,059
basically a grill basic Python shell to

329
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,339
the pilot mode which is a little bit

330
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,259
nicer editor so when your fire up the

331
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,839
Python shell from kicad you can or from

332
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,549
pcbnew you can get a little bit nicer

333
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:59,709
shell - or nicer Python shell to work

334
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,839
with we have object selection filtering

335
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,029
the gal canvas you can that's that's not

336
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:06,249
been committed yet but that's coming you

337
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,110
can you know filter by objects so you

338
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,459
know when you're selecting a big group

339
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,999
you can just filter by say a footprint

340
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,980
or text or whatever and you only going

341
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,720
to get the text so just a couple of code

342
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,089
improvements the 3d model has a plug-in

343
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,259
manager which brought in open OCE

344
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,559
that's one of the reasons we got step

345
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,809
the schematic plug-in is IO managers

346
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,850
just about done and getting ready to be

347
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,889
committed that'll give us the ability to

348
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,499
start importing other for direct import

349
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,999
of other formats without you know

350
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,369
providing like a script to convert from

351
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,920
somebody else's format to which is what

352
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,929
a lot of users do right now like from

353
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,670
Eagle to schema

354
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,809
it'll just be you open up an eagle file

355
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,459
the new file formats that's still

356
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,049
questionable yet there's a lot of work

357
00:14:59,049 --> 00:14:59,410
to be

358
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,230
there we're getting close to having all

359
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,670
the editing tools from the old legacy

360
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,089
canvas done into the open what the gal

361
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:13,029
canvases which are OpenGL and the fall

362
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,949
back to Cairo when the rendering when

363
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,920
that's not done we moved I took all the

364
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,720
we don't download libraries and build

365
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,670
them anymore all right we expect that we

366
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,069
had now have pretty much full coverage

367
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,680
for all platforms on our auto builders

368
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,110
so we really don't we don't really need

369
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,100
to do this anymore

370
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,529
so because I'm not asking users to build

371
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,300
them source anymore since we have such

372
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,480
good our nightly builds commit goes in

373
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,000
it's usually built within a couple hours

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,430
unless there's a problem so we don't do

375
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,550
that anymore we're now C++ 11 project we

376
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,810
turned the corner and just said okay

377
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,939
we're going to do we're going to quit

378
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,660
we're going to turn on 11 and the usual

379
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,350
blog fixing and polishing probably one

380
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,060
of the things that you don't get a lot

381
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,319
of people don't get a lot of credit for

382
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,399
but if you've been paying attention

383
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,490
recently to the number of commits to the

384
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,800
art libraries the quality of our

385
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,389
libraries both footprint and symbol

386
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:09,459
libraries has significantly improved and

387
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,470
there's a lot more coverage those guys

388
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,910
have been doing a bang-up job they

389
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,350
probably don't get them as much credit

390
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,389
as they should

391
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,040
documentation is coming along well too

392
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,560
and as of right now version 4 has been

393
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
translated fully translated in all those

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,470
languages

395
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,019
I expect version 5 will be 2 because

396
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,399
there hasn't been a huge number of

397
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,110
changes in terms of the code

398
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,100
internationalization you know the

399
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,480
strings haven't changed that much so it

400
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,069
won't be a huge problem

401
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,170
ok version 6 I'm gonna scream through

402
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,079
this as fast as I can

403
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,279
version 6 the schematic editor is going

404
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,990
to get a lot of work we're gonna get

405
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,040
their grant we're going to put that over

406
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,059
to the the graphic extraction layer

407
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,029
that'll be OpenGL and Cairo the new tool

408
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:53,829
framework which will give us the Select

409
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,470
selection and of objects similar to what

410
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,829
we have now in pcbnew we're going to

411
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,930
have a shared object a common low-level

412
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,609
library for the schematic objects

413
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,809
there's also going to be highlighting

414
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,880
when you're working in pcbnew you click

415
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,520
on a net and the trace and the board

416
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,910
editor

417
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,589
gets highlighted it's part of the

418
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,910
original the first part of that change

419
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,290
has been done where we can just click on

420
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,400
that some highlight that'll be

421
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,959
bi-directional if I'm in the board

422
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,839
editor I click on the on a trace or no

423
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,819
you know it all connected traces it's

424
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,810
going to go back the other way and

425
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,209
highlight that in the in the board edit

426
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,010
earned the schematic editor we're going

427
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,840
to change over to system fonts instead

428
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,270
of right now using our hard coded font

429
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,400
which the reason we have that is because

430
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,830
if you render boards it has to be

431
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,570
accurate on the schematic it doesn't

432
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,010
matter so here people can use creative

433
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,130
fonts and use whatever they want I'm not

434
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,140
that was kind of a implementation thing

435
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,660
this is coming we're working on this now

436
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,850
already but it's not going to be I don't

437
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,350
want to hold up the next stable version

438
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,780
for that I'd love to have it in my

439
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,030
pocket right now be off with all

440
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,860
fairness in all honesty but we're

441
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,720
working on that so that means you got a

442
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,820
schematic you got a we already have that

443
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,440
direct import of if you don't know we

444
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,660
already directly import equal board

445
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,990
files and footprint libraries but we

446
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,460
still don't have the schematic and the

447
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,370
symbol libraries import is our that's

448
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,810
our kilise we're missing that part right

449
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,130
so you can't you know you want to be

450
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,650
able to put both pieces back together so

451
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,620
that's coming in the next version yeah

452
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,990
it's just giving me fits once we you

453
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,650
know and we're also gonna swing out et

454
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,990
schema said that'll give us Python and

455
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,090
any other scripting languages swig

456
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,860
supports and anybody wants to attempt to

457
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,630
build right now we're just swing down to

458
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,130
Python just like the board editor yeah

459
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,170
lots of things DRC library management

460
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,480
usability we're going to go in the board

461
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,830
editor we're gonna have support for

462
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,310
complex pad shapes pin and gate swapping

463
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,660
that comes with a new file format

464
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,940
because there's the current file format

465
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,950
won't support that so then that'll be

466
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,510
bi-directional so you change something

467
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,050
in the the board and you swap you swap

468
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,090
pins to make a route better your trip

469
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,220
layout better it's going to be reflected

470
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,430
back in the schematic full clipboard

471
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,290
support we're weak there we're trying it

472
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,390
that comes with a new file format too

473
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,750
because I don't have two parsers to cut

474
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,119
and paste stuff so we're doing that

475
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,009
redoing the geometry libraries we're

476
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,329
gonna have improve coverage for our

477
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,279
design rule checks on the board so

478
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,159
that's going to be big and that'll be a

479
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,719
battle darkness give me you keep out

480
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,819
zones on boards and then we're gonna do

481
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,039
the same application of the wild card of

482
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,129
the search on the footprint a library

483
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:49,579
search so hatched zones right now our

484
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:52,849
design fills our solid externally linked

485
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,709
objects and that comes with the groups

486
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,669
so you can like group a part of the

487
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,219
board layout and duplicate it multiple

488
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:03,229
times with external reference you make

489
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,529
the change to one and all the I think

490
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,509
it's called snippets and some of the

491
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,259
other dat packages board stack up and

492
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,059
peens calculator that maybe that one

493
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,519
would be a stretch we also like to do

494
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,709
the improve the rats nesting so that you

495
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:22,399
we can change colors of know of each rat

496
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,949
of each line or turn the visibly Oh turn

497
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,089
one and you know if you have a complex

498
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,199
board you have to have a look at all the

499
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:30,169
entire rat's nest and you're like ah you

500
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:31,159
know you can't see the forest through

501
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:32,689
the trees so we're gonna make some

502
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,289
improvements there this one if what WX

503
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:37,909
widgets ever gets attacked to get it's a

504
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,579
a UI together we might that one may not

505
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,739
happen again and we'd also like to port

506
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,959
the gerber viewer to the that would

507
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,639
benefit from being OpenGL because that's

508
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:50,919
pretty graphics intensive okay way out

509
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,939
microwave support tool for the board

510
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:56,089
editor because that will need the the

511
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,949
the geometry library would be needed to

512
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,739
support that import ODB plus plus

513
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,779
possibly export a lot of people like to

514
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:05,409
use that in the commercial world

515
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,969
database management we there's been a

516
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,769
lot of interest in that lady lately from

517
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,389
commercial vendors that they want to be

518
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,849
able to you know if plug into their CIS

519
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:16,699
system they make a part change they want

520
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,199
the schematic editor to say hey you're

521
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,989
CIS system a depart change or it

522
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,209
sparkling obsolete you want to some of

523
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,009
the CAD programs already do that you get

524
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:27,289
a warning that's long real long term

525
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,729
stuff because that's really a lot of

526
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:33,349
work move to I want to go to plugins for

527
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,749
everything so eventually if we can use

528
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:37,129
competing technology for things like

529
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,390
Auto placers auto routers routing tool

530
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,679
we could have specialized routing tools

531
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,690
where maybe I have a microwave rallying

532
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,160
tool specifically for routing microwaves

533
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,450
and that you don't use the normal

534
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,860
because it wouldn't make sense to use

535
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,280
that in a microwave application unit

536
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,130
testing we we have some work to do there

537
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:58,020
and integrate Kamado seen i've actually

538
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,370
been one of the things the guide

539
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,140
educators interested in was donating

540
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,230
time for obvious reasons I'm not look

541
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,790
I'm not naive I know what do you where

542
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,100
he was going but I you know hey I told

543
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,270
me as long as the code meets our

544
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,710
standards and it will have to be

545
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,140
abstract because I told him I slike know

546
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,429
it's not going to be propriety it's

547
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:16,020
gonna be abstract and so other vendors

548
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,360
want to build on top of that that you

549
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,400
know that's my you know as the project

550
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,660
leader I have to make those decisions

551
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,360
and that that's my decision so until I'm

552
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,540
not project leader anymore so in that

553
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,950
and we actually have quite a few people

554
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,049
that like that ID click on it your it

555
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,760
generates the building materials goes

556
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,890
out in order say I want 20 sets of parts

557
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,290
for this board and boom you know those

558
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,960
two digit key or Farnell or whoever your

559
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,040
vendor dejour is and places an order you

560
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,230
give me your credit card number and got

561
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,830
parts admit if parts of the mail okay I

562
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,049
want to thank just a quick shout out

563
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,210
thanks all the developers who give their

564
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,580
time and talent it's it takes a lot of

565
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,090
work

566
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,190
keek adds a big project really big

567
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,140
project people underestimate exactly how

568
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,220
big it is thank you thank you everybody

569
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,080
who's interested in kicad and for using

570
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,910
kicad i hope you know we can continue to

571
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,429
support whatever you're doing we're you

572
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:13,110
know I know the pace of developments

573
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,760
never as fast as anybody wants it's not

574
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
as fast as I would like but we have

575
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,799
manpower you know we're like any other

576
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,020
open-source project there's more to do

577
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,390
than there's people to do it and I want

578
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,040
to give a special shout-out to haviar

579
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,650
and CERN for their support because they

580
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,510
may they make this possible this dev

581
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,250
room and they've contributed a lot to

582
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,660
kicad and we have them a big big great

583
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,280
deal thanks so thank you everybody again

584
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,700
for coming

585
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:59,430
all right the the question is is how can

586
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,110
I make sure that the schematic and the

587
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,710
board are up up to date on the can I do

588
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,360
it on the command I know it's it's it's

589
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,150
going to be in the the graphical user

590
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,670
interface and honestly we don't have a

591
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,380
direct way to do that right now I

592
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,530
suppose we could write some kind of

593
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,040
connectivity issue where we say hey your

594
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,390
schematics changed it will impact your

595
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,730
board at least warn you because we do

596
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,960
have the tool now where you can do the

597
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,790
direct you're going to be able to

598
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,800
directly update the schematic or from

599
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,270
your in the board oh yeah I updated my

600
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,010
schematic yeah go update from schematic

601
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:37,350
so it's it's something to think about I

602
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,360
mean certainly if it's something we can

603
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
we'd have to look at but I'm sure it's

604
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,680
doable I mean a lot of these things are

605
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,560
doable it's just you know when do we do

606
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,500
you

607
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,900
we yes in the schematic editor because

608
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,310
we have a script that we haven't swigged

609
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,850
it out yet
