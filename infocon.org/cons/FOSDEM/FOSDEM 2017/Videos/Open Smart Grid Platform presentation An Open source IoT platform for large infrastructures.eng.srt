1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
you think your spots

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,549
all right okay hello everybody my name

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,860
is Sami Anza today I like to talk about

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,949
the open smart grid platform maybe maybe

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,570
you expect that the onus from the

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,039
bowhead here but he was sick so I

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,269
replace him together with you like I

8
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,369
said I like to talk about the open smart

9
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,289
grid platform why did we start the open

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:31,660
Smith cut open smart way platform I work

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,240
at the Dutch utility known as le on

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,320
there and that le under where a power

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,930
distribution company so we provide

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,030
electricity to the houses we distribute

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,420
electricity and we see a change changing

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,320
landscape and the field of energy their

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,699
energy is shifting from centralized

18
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,500
production to a more decentralized

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,989
production and what we need is more

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,010
insights integrates to cope with this

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,920
with this change and one particular

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,019
example where we needed the open smart

23
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,500
gate platform was for switching the

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,740
public lighting what we have right now

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,020
is a technology called ripple control

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,360
technology which basically is a big

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,490
sender who sends out two pools over the

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,510
50 Hertz great and then you have devices

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,450
that pick up that signal and then switch

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,880
on the street lights or treats them off

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,430
not really intelligent and also

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,100
municipalities were banging us from a we

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,690
like to have more control over the

34
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,440
street lights

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,170
so then colleagues were looking into a

36
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,420
solution to control all those devices

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,510
and and build an app for for

38
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,390
municipalities and they found that the

39
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,630
existing vendors were very locked up it

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,500
was a silo yet high cost on a long term

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,140
and a big fan of lock-in so therefore

42
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,850
colleagues decided to build our own and

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,370
part of that is a the open smart grid

44
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,880
platform

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,160
so opens market platform is a layered

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
architecture and can be seen as an IOT

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,040
gateway between applications and devices

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,280
so with an application you can connect

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,320
to out the open smart grid platform to

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,040
devices and current use cases include

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,380
smart lighting like I said for

52
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,620
municipalities smart metering so you can

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,130
read millions of smart meters micro

54
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,550
grids we have an island in Amsterdam

55
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,489
which is his own microbe it's a small

56
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,450
grid will balance its itself and that

57
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,420
it's using opensparc a platform to send

58
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,050
out signals we're also planning to use

59
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,330
it in distribution automation where we

60
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,970
want to use it to get data out of the

61
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,940
grid to prevent outages or to recover

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,780
outages faster load management is a

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,900
thing we're working on that's especially

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,670
relevant in Germany where sometimes it's

65
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,079
too much solar power so the the start

66
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,180
record the utility wants to switch off

67
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,150
certain solar panels that could be done

68
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,920
with the opus particle platform as well

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,640
and the open smart gate platform also

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,280
contains device management so you can

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,000
see which devices are connected and

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,519
right now there are multiple protocols

73
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,380
connected to the open smart gate

74
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,540
platform DMMs chosen for smart metering

75
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,380
61 850 and open streetlight protocol for

76
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,549
smart lighting

77
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,390
so a little bit more detail about the

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,840
open smart grid platform you get web

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,230
services on top and everywhere Web

80
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,760
Services fits to a certain domain for

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,549
example smart metering that domain

82
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,480
checks if if if a comment is allowed can

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,989
this application is this application

84
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,089
allowed to access that this kind of

85
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,959
smart meters then you get a core layer

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,220
which reroutes

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,100
the messages to the correct protocol

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,260
adapters you can have multiple protocol

89
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,580
adapters within the same domain and that

90
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,340
koala also incorporates all the generic

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,630
functions like time synchronization and

92
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,280
keep track of all your devices so a list

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,910
of a list of devices and on below you

94
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,340
have the protocol layer which start

95
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,310
directly to devices with different

96
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,180
protocols

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,100
key features of the platform is that

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,310
it's fully scalable and I performance we

99
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,810
build it so you can scale out to

100
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,170
millions of devices if you want to yeah

101
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,960
since we're a utility company security

102
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,930
is quite vital for us because Society

103
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,780
expect us to keep the grid on so they're

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,520
state-of-the-art security and Security's

105
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,180
building from the ground up and a lot of

106
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,620
security measurements the platform is

107
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,270
generic I showed you some use cases from

108
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,660
the smart grids field but you can also

109
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,390
at your own and make use of the generic

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,820
framework what we're having and it's

111
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,140
open source for them and we try to use

112
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,360
as much as open standards as possible

113
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,670
where we can find a good one okay so now

114
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,100
it's time for a quick demo

115
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,010
[Music]

116
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,720
so hello my name is you I work for CGI

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,310
and part of the development team that

118
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,009
helped developing this application I'm

119
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,889
gonna give you a small technical demo

120
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,909
just going to go through it quickly we

121
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,030
have different components through which

122
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,879
messages are sent we use ActiveMQ to

123
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,650
deliver those messages a small demo we

124
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,539
built the flight simulator for the olp

125
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,740
protocol so we can add devices here and

126
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,650
you simulate the messages and took 12

127
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,340
devices

128
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,990
[Music]

129
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,960
we also have a demo application so we

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,580
can see the devices over here we can add

131
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,000
them and control them as well so I'm

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,169
just going to add a device

133
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,890
so the device will be delivered to to

134
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,360
the platform and now we can simulate the

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,010
device actually being connected so I'm

136
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,539
going to end up just over here

137
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,040
so this simulates the device actually

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,310
being connected to the platform platform

139
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,430
picks it up so it registers itself

140
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,030
I'm also gonna go from register and then

141
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,479
confirm

142
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,510
so the device is now added to the

143
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,480
platform so we can do stuff with it like

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,289
this what this actually does is it

145
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,080
fetches the status of the device so it

146
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,610
asked at the device can you give me the

147
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,139
status and asynchronous sync it returns

148
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,750
the message this is my status so in this

149
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,519
case the lights off it has no value what

150
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,820
we can do is we turn on the lights

151
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,429
it sends another request towards the

152
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,950
platform in which it says well I want to

153
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,779
have for this specific device I want to

154
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,690
have the lights on so it gets delivered

155
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,130
to the platform at processes it and as

156
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,149
you can see in the simulator realizes

157
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,630
now on

158
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,640
okay thank you for the demonstration now

159
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,529
we take a look a little bit closer at

160
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,250
the how it works technically you saw the

161
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,980
demo application on the top and the

162
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,880
device simulator below so a message get

163
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,550
routed to a throughout the integration

164
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,040
layer to the domain layer and to the

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,310
core layer and then to the specific

166
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,980
protocol adapter and to make the

167
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,370
platform scalable we use message queues

168
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,070
between all those layers and that makes

169
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,740
sure that multiple server instances can

170
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,600
can grab messages one thing I like to

171
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,339
point out is that the open smart grid

172
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,589
platform is not a historian so it

173
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,540
doesn't store data it just passes

174
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,709
through commands but it does store all

175
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,740
the devices that are connected to the

176
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,550
platform so feel free to join the open

177
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,230
smart gate platform especially if your

178
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,120
organization that manages a lot of

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,740
devices I think this could be

180
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,680
interesting project to look into and see

181
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,920
if it's featural requirements we try to

182
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,470
be as open as possible so we have

183
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,709
extensive documentation for free to

184
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,110
connect your hardware or application and

185
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,970
help to drive innovation

186
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:44,360
okay question okay so the question is

187
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,269
are we do with protocol adapters because

188
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,920
there are a lot of fenders out there and

189
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,779
how do we incorporate that so for the

190
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,230
public street light example we did a

191
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,410
tender to four devices and then couple

192
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,700
of device suppliers showed up and then

193
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,130
we had adaptive protocol adapter to that

194
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,190
specific device but if you look at the

195
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,339
smart metering for example and you take

196
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,130
a implementation of the protocol as the

197
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,399
protocol as should be implemented then

198
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,000
it shouldn't be that hard to do to

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,610
incorporate it in the platform but but

200
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,410
for now every device needs some

201
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,560
attention some adjustments to make it

202
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,739
work

203
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,730
the there are some devices already okay

204
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,130
now can we open source the the current

205
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,980
implementation yeah we are already open

206
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,690
sourced the ones that are there that are

207
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,010
available you know

208
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,670
oh okay yeah how many devices the

209
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,530
imagine of woven do you have like the

210
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,790
big server burn and doing Billy

211
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:08,230
okay clearly things how many devices are

212
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,029
connected to the platform right now and

213
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,790
do we use the platform yeah we're still

214
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,529
we're still in a testing phase for a

215
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,870
large roll out for the public street

216
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,810
lights and we're planning to for twenty

217
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,650
thousand devices connected and I'm not

218
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,540
sure sure how many servers are needed

219
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,460
for that do you know no no but yeah like

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,470
I said you can scale on so if if needed

221
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,530
then you can add more servers

222
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,860
give it anything to providing data back

223
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,120
to the owners of smart meters

224
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:56,389
to the great okay so so the first

225
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,630
question is are we sharing data with

226
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,510
other other utilities or data consumers

227
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,130
currently at Leone we have a program

228
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,060
called open data and there's that's the

229
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,779
place where we share some information

230
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,370
all the information is shared with the

231
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,180
market regulatory systems so in the

232
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,120
Netherlands you have distribution power

233
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,829
distribution operator that reads out all

234
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,019
the smart meters and you get a different

235
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,480
party that produces and delivers the

236
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,490
energy itself so there's a mark

237
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,019
mechanism in the Netherlands that make

238
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,850
sure that the data from that smart meter

239
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,350
is going to that supply our producer

240
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,440
don't you where the other question about

241
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,779
the data data historian why is not a

242
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,850
data historian part of the open smart

243
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,579
gate platform I think that there are

244
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,399
other solutions to store data and to

245
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,639
process it and analyze it and it really

246
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,740
depends on the use case what's best

247
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,370
what's the best solution so therefore we

248
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,839
did it include it here

249
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,630
okay yeah you said stay at the earth

250
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,690
security what does that mean absolu

251
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,360
what does state-of-the-art security mean

252
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,530
well we're actually test the the

253
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,500
implementation we do set certificates we

254
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,740
do signing we have extensive user

255
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,760
authorization model so in case of the

256
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,830
public lighting we want to give a

257
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,490
municipality access to a certain area of

258
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,700
course not other somebody else their

259
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,730
municipality and then that municipality

260
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,610
can give access to a subcontractor and

261
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,710
that subcontractor can give access to

262
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,590
another except constructors so there's a

263
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,020
fine-grain mechanism to authorize

264
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,040
certain functions on on certain devices

265
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,990
running this software gets to control

266
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,800
who gets rejected

267
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,630
it depends who gets outside who gets

268
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,760
access is that something this software

269
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,829
does or something that you know as you

270
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,480
say for the smart meters the utility

271
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,740
decides that you have any choice about

272
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,820
that so the question is who's who makes

273
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,420
the decision who's allowed to talk to

274
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,220
which device while the depends on the

275
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,010
operator of the platform in our case we

276
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,890
run it ourself but it's also you can run

277
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,569
your own and then you're your own boss

278
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:54,390
so the question was how did we open

279
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,750
source it and how did we convince the

280
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,820
management to make it open source now I

281
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,579
personally one of the person that make

282
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,790
that happen so I was already a big fan

283
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,609
of open source so I thought let's make

284
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,329
it my work as well so I started to give

285
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,869
presentations to numerous departments

286
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,400
about open source and why should you use

287
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,939
it

288
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,000
I think we're owned by the society we're

289
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,079
part of a government owned and we have a

290
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,079
monopoly so in that sense I think it's

291
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,070
also fair to share our codes what we

292
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,820
produce and as I says I also think it's

293
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,870
a good way to collaborate with others

294
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,820
because otherwise you end up in a fan

295
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,280
the Lockean situation where the vendor

296
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,410
kind of decides still certain extent

297
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,750
what you can do and what you can do and

298
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,910
that's not a world I see working well

299
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,910
and then specific to the open smart grid

300
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,799
platform I noticed that the project was

301
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,590
going on there so I asked the guys opus

302
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,330
want to get platform I looked on get up

303
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,510
can find it so how open is open and then

304
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,549
they said well summer we need to talk so

305
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,559
I told them about open source and why

306
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,320
you should do it and etc and then we ran

307
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,419
at the end of song and then decided ok

308
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,570
open source the way to go and over here

309
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,840
yeah

310
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,050
sorry Eskimos know you've mentioned an

311
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,270
island in the Netherlands where this is

312
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,420
happening what's it called pampas it

313
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,750
says it's a small island and the waters

314
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,340
in Amsterdam and it used to be a German

315
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,810
fort and as a restaurant on it and they

316
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,760
they have their own solar panel and

317
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,710
diesel generator and that's kind of

318
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,010
stuff so they want to balance that out

319
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,130
so they got a programmable logic

320
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,990
controller on that island and this opens

321
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,420
might be a platform gives a precise

322
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,120
access to that programmable logic

323
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,580
controller is there one controller in

324
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,330
that specific

325
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,690
Island yes yes yeah one controller it's

326
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,910
it's pretty small

327
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,530
more questions yeah go ahead

328
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:46,990
I was wondering okay this is a system so

329
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,430
the question is what happened if there's

330
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,950
a power outage well that's our business

331
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,180
so if first of all we got all the data

332
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,030
centers backups etc etc we got our

333
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,010
private telecommunication network with

334
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,810
also some some uptime and if you take a

335
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,480
look at the open street lights for

336
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,390
example the devices are smart enough to

337
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,830
load switching schemes on it so if the

338
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,710
if the platform goes down or the telecom

339
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,620
network goes down then when asperities

340
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,870
are not able to add hoc switch their

341
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,580
street lights but the building scheme is

342
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,690
still still working and by that way it

343
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,960
should work

344
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,460
so the question is do we manage a

345
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,880
battery storage yeah that the battery

346
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,070
store can be added to the platform as

347
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,310
well 61 850 is one of the ruling

348
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,550
protocols in in the quote/unquote smart

349
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,070
grid field and also supports batteries

350
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,580
and that Island in Amsterdam pampas has

351
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,520
also its own battery and it's connected

352
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,280
to out the r2u or programmable logic

353
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,670
controller

354
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:47,440
how much been with this so the question

355
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,730
is how many bent resistor within with

356
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,540
the smart metering I don't know but it's

357
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,590
not not that much italiana we we brought

358
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,570
our own frequency and we built our own

359
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,600
telecom network a CDMA but it doesn't

360
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,210
have a lot of bandwidth but most smart

361
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,570
meters are only read six times a year so

362
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,470
yeah that should work but I'm not an

363
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,160
expert in this field

364
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,420
[Music]

365
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,960
easy doctor don't even put a rule in

366
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,760
turn these lights on at this time we're

367
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,830
trying to

368
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,300
so the question is is there a rule

369
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,240
engine inside the platform I know that

370
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,360
there's a limited rule engine in the

371
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,430
domain layer but I don't know exactly

372
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,470
the details but in terms of that

373
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,360
switching schedule for public lighting

374
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,330
which is also a kind of rule that can be

375
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,460
transferred to the device via this

376
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,030
platform

377
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,999
[Music]

378
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,920
so the question is how to scale the the

379
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,930
the platform

380
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,270
yeah well the all the layers are

381
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,150
consists of multiple servers and when

382
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,370
the server's get too busy then you can

383
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,260
start a new one and you want anyone and

384
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,950
scale them vertically horizontally

385
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,060
you can take one last question last

386
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,100
question there how do you use

387
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,880
so the question is did we start from

388
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,470
scratch or did we use some other code

389
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,779
from the protocol layer I know that

390
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,630
we're using open source libraries though

391
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,440
by the Fraunhofer Institute and we also

392
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,480
give them some tasks to improve there's

393
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,289
those libraries and from the development

394
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,470
point of view we use Tomcat and a spring

395
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,919
framework and a more lively to to make a

396
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:21,190
work

397
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:30,889
