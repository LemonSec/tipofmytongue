1
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:23,410
is Derek here okay I have body

2
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,540
I am Federico Capuano I'm in court

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,370
developer of the open double-speed

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,810
project I work for a consortium and here

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,379
Shaniqua consortium which is an Italian

6
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,920
non-profit consortium that offers

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,469
services to Italian institutions and my

8
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,600
job is public Wi-Fi

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,670
I'm also contributor of Nimitz and

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,479
Italian wireless community network and

11
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,429
I'm here to present you the new open

12
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,620
doublespeak controller it's an

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,420
application with which you can manage

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,170
open up your tea or liddie devices you

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,819
can use it to implement a mesh network

16
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,970
or a public Wi-Fi or any network you can

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,790
implement with open WT because I have a

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,700
very short time less than 50 minutes I

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,110
prepare the screencast because I wanted

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,600
to do a demonstration so I will play the

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,210
video and explain you the main features

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,070
because I think this is the best way to

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,290
give you an idea of what you can do with

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,390
this software ok

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,790
you see here this is the Django admin

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,620
interface you have three main objects

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,770
which are configurations which

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,900
represents configurations of devices

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,350
templates are bits of configurations

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,080
that are shared among devices VPN

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,700
servers are configurations of VPNs that

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,820
you can use it's optional to automate

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,790
VPN connections from clients and see

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,380
certification authorities and

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,930
certificates are used for a specific use

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,540
case of this automation of VPN

37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,270
certificates so let's go ahead here I'm

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:13,319
creating a template and I give it a name

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,750
the four just to start with something

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,560
easy I'm creating I'm defining a time

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,170
zone because I know that all my devices

42
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,330
will use the same time zone so I define

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,239
it just once and I give it the most

44
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,370
appropriate time zone for me which is

45
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,610
wrong and then I remove the other fields

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,050
because I don't need them because those

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,019
fields are usually used locally on each

48
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,129
device and this is a template it will be

49
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,280
shared and used by all the devices I

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,200
hear and I show the Advanced Mode which

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,390
you can edit the configuration in a JSON

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,110
format

53
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,950
it's called net JSON look it up it's an

54
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,970
attempt to standardize some

55
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,010
configuration stuff related to the

56
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,930
networking so I give it a description a

57
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,180
descriptive name and I save it and this

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,959
is it I'm assuming you're using open wrt

59
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,720
i also flag it as enabled by default

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,440
which will make it activated on by

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,180
default on each device that will

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,069
register to the system i say and i go

63
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,799
ahead i add a new template sometimes

64
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,889
this time slightly more advanced I want

65
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,430
to add my SSH key into all devices so I

66
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,850
can log in and manage them without

67
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,220
supplying a password so here show how to

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,489
do that you add a file you have to it's

69
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,620
a little bit of an advanced system you

70
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,209
have to know what you're doing if you

71
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,010
know what you're doing it's really

72
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,319
powerful but it's not yet we're ready

73
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,180
for users that have no knowledge of

74
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,269
networking so I added the SSE SSH key

75
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,799
and now I do something slightly more

76
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,450
complicated I let's say I know many

77
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,529
devices will have two gigahertz Wi-Fi

78
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,200
access points Wi-Fi access point

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,039
interface and I I do that I create a

80
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,210
template for this use case

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
here I'm probably talking in the video I

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,479
went too fast here it is I give it the

83
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,960
name to bigger Wi-Fi access point if I

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,690
enabled by default I start by creating

85
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,190
the radio so in open wrt you have to

86
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,470
define the radio the configuration of

87
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,990
the radio like what power what channel

88
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,580
and then you define the Wi-Fi interface

89
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,130
the SSID and this kind of stuff so here

90
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm adding the radio you can see that I

91
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,630
mostly use the defaults

92
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,940
I can leave some some fields empty and I

93
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,060
they select the channel I leave it Auto

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,750
so Linux will automatically select the

95
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,630
channel it finds best I put a low-power

96
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,449
for the radio I select my country and

97
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,680
then I'm ready and I proceed with adding

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,940
the interface and you can see that there

99
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,349
are quite many options here I select the

100
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,830
wireless interface there is also bridge

101
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,099
and normal network interface I leave all

102
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:49,289
these fields empty I have to manually

103
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,900
unfortunately still type radio zero in

104
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,830
that red field here I'm showing the

105
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,380
options you have now we use access

106
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,780
points you also have mesh you have a

107
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,550
dock station

108
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,800
I give it an SSID here i type in Fossum

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
test open SS p2

110
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,570
these fields are more slightly more

111
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,310
advanced and we don't care about them

112
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,230
now and I leave the network with no

113
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:26,050
encryption and the radio is there done

114
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,260
already just to check that the result is

115
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,000
good if you have experience with open

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,430
wrt you can check the preview and it

117
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,870
will show you the generated

118
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,150
configuration so if you have experience

119
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,950
with this school you see how you can

120
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,330
check that everything is correct that's

121
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,250
actually what will be installed on the

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,360
system we have package Network and

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,580
package Wireless and we are ready to go

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,320
and we save it so now I show you how to

125
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,840
create a configuration you usually won't

126
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,200
need to do this manually because devices

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,450
if you are managing many devices you

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,640
compile a filmer that will automatically

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,330
register to the application and so you

130
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,490
want to do this it will be mostly

131
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,130
automatic if you if you work well with

132
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,650
the templates but here I'm doing it

133
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,900
manually inserting a dummy MAC address

134
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,320
just for example purposes you see that

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,780
now scrolling down those are the

136
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,820
templates that are automatically

137
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,640
selected we just created in the video

138
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,470
and now you if you you see that the

139
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,600
configuration is empty but the templates

140
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,240
are there and if you hit preview you

141
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,910
will see the final resulting

142
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,200
configuration in text playing format you

143
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,970
see the timezone is what we set there

144
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,070
which opened ability is a bit strange

145
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,430
and then you see what we created before

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,820
an SSH key we save it and once you save

147
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,880
it you can also download the generated

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,600
configuration which is a tar.gz

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,580
which contains what you usually put on

150
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,789
open TT on open TT this will be added to

151
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,699
the existing configuration in a smart

152
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,300
way so you can remove it updated but not

153
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,750
mess with the existing configuration so

154
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,120
now I went on an a different system and

155
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm showing you how a device will

156
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,790
automatically reduce it to the system so

157
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,339
this is open wrt the web interface on

158
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,970
the new device I just have to set up the

159
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,610
LAN interface so it can connect to the

160
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,350
internet because the controller now is

161
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,120
hosted on the internet but you can also

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,930
see it locally on a local area network

163
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,130
is up to you the set up really so here I

164
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,200
selected the DHCP and I the network

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,020
reconfigures and I have to log in again

166
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,459
this is open wrt

167
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,820
it's a Linux distribution for routers

168
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,730
and wireless networks anything it's also

169
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,829
used for IOT and now I show that there

170
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,920
is a demon that tries to contact the

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,170
open WSP - controller here I'm logging

172
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,970
in again after having reconfigure the

173
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,700
access point and here you see maybe you

174
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,829
cannot read but it says new device

175
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,190
register successfully as the MAC address

176
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,649
and the ID and then it says

177
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,570
configuration controller has changed

178
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,930
testing configuration so the daemon also

179
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,940
tests that the configuration works if it

180
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,750
doesn't work it's it rolls back ten

181
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,529
minutes left

182
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,829
I thought less actually that's good so

183
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,290
here I show you that the demo now we'll

184
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,700
have configure itself they you the ID

185
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,910
and it's key this is the stuff it uses

186
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,699
to download the configuration from the

187
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,180
controller

188
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,720
and you see the host name here changed

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,130
it automatically said it's MAC address

190
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,380
so now you can take these MAC address go

191
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,250
in the list of the devices you update

192
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,900
and you'll find it there and you give it

193
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,840
a better name of course here I call it

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,080
Fossum test and you see the default

195
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,180
templates are automatically selected so

196
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,670
it has already downloaded them but I

197
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,820
also add the two gigahertz Wi-Fi and you

198
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,040
can see you can also override or add

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,740
more stuff in a single device

200
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,350
configuration here just you know this is

201
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,180
something you could do for maintenance

202
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,720
propose add the descriptions of you know

203
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,110
here I put maintainer as myself and I

204
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,570
add a node test device

205
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,750
I usually before saving I always check

206
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,650
the configuration you can see this quite

207
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,450
a lot of stuff from the default

208
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,090
templates but this is automatic I didn't

209
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,930
have to do anything

210
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,510
once you define the templates adding new

211
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,950
devices is really easy so now it's saved

212
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,070
and here I open the lock grid

213
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,990
interactive mode again to show what is

214
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,120
performing behind the scenes and you see

215
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,640
it was testing the configuration it's

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,980
reloading everything you see quite a lot

217
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,760
of logs from all the components of open

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,030
wrt and the configuration test succeeded

219
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,620
and now it's configured you see the

220
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,180
wlan0 interface is brought up and the

221
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,860
SSID of the free Wi-Fi service which is

222
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,810
breached

223
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,240
the Wi-Fi is bridged with a layer 2 VPN

224
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,160
here and the layer 2 VPN is correctly

225
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,420
running here show it with a command

226
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,770
so I got all this stuff done for me

227
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,610
automatically in no time

228
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,110
it's pretty it's pretty powerful still

229
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,530
not for users that don't know much about

230
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,330
networking but I really want to make it

231
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,460
easier but now we're getting more users

232
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,580
we're getting a lot of interest from

233
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,950
emerging economies especially India and

234
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,800
South America it's quite interesting but

235
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,190
we use this software also a lot in Italy

236
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,770
Italian institutions use it for offering

237
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:12,100
public Wi-Fi the old version but some

238
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,170
people some institutions are starting to

239
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,030
picking this up for example the

240
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,430
University of Urbino is using it to

241
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,580
manage is own Wi-Fi they also use it to

242
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,240
provide ad ROM to the students and okay

243
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,270
how much time do I have left

244
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,750
seven minutes no two minutes okay so

245
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:44,680
time for questions there's no time you

246
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,100
you use a term validation validation is

247
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,870
the validation of the schema before you

248
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,840
save then there is a demon test the

249
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,760
configuration there is a default test

250
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,700
and the default test is that the device

251
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,220
is able to contact the controller again

252
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,260
after the new configuration but you can

253
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,189
define your own test

254
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,020
no no the default test is very simple

255
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,150
the default test is I can contact the

256
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,100
controller again it's not necessary on

257
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,660
the internet the important thing is that

258
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,590
you can reach the device if something is

259
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,410
wrong you can fix it manually or you can

260
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,350
define your own test it depends on you

261
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,870
on your use case I cannot foresee all

262
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,120
the uses cases of the people that we use

263
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,220
it so you will have to define your own

264
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,940
test in the framework so what's a hard

265
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:00,850
problem HTTP why not it was easier to

266
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,310
implement it's just me working is and

267
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,810
also I do it in my free time zone
