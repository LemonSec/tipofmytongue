1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,770
so the next enlightening time

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:11,370
ah Kisan energy and energy grids we

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:19,860
welcome our speaker hi my name is nikole

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,180
iike i'm gonna talk something about

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,740
energy daytime why it's important for

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,550
you

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,410
my background is electrical engineering

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,600
I studied that and for the four last

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,800
four and a half years I've been building

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,680
on an energy data transmission platform

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,629
which is mostly decentralized it's

12
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:35,879
called hello data it's in the

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,929
Netherlands and I think it's all you can

14
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,120
all use energy data some way one way or

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,920
another because it's important

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,809
firstly because it's a large part of

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,329
every consumers build so there's a lot

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,519
of optimization you can do secondly

19
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:52,199
because it's very influential in terms

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,179
of it says something about your behavior

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,479
this is a daily pattern of consumers

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,039
usage you say they are sleeping just

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,960
refrigerator using some energy then they

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,990
wake up they use energy then in the in

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,700
the during the lunch maybe they heat up

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,799
something in the microwave and they come

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,290
back they watch television here they do

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,960
the washing here afterwards when you go

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,439
to bed they do the dishes so there's a

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,060
lot of things you can do with energy

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,920
data in potential as long as you know

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,210
how to use it and that's why I'm giving

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,100
this talk so traditionally this is the

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,990
electrical grid we are using

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,350
regenerating from power plants and fat

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,810
all the way down to industry and

37
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,799
residential consumers and we need to

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,390
build the energy we deliver and we bill

39
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,880
ideally barrels of oil or amounts of

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,250
energy but there's a difference between

41
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,859
energy in a barrel and flow energy

42
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,549
flowing and if you take it to integrate

43
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,329
it over time

44
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,060
so you have energy flowing and so the

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,549
point you have a volume of energy and

46
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,320
that's the difference between for

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,789
example in energy you have kilowatts

48
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,890
which is the flow the flow of energy the

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,619
amounts rushing in and kilowatt hours

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,560
which is your volume of energy this is

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,580
something to look out for and especially

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,680
in billing we're interested in the

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,709
amount of energy

54
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,980
we delivered so on the left are the

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,870
internals of a gas meter which are

56
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,519
basically two containers two lungs

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,469
pumping up gas into the other so we know

58
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,439
in pieces of gas how much is delivered

59
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,810
on the right we have a disk which is for

60
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,909
the electricity meter which is voltage

61
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:39,219
and current which results into power

62
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,159
which is flow and that spins the wheel

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,010
on the meter and thereby registers the

64
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,439
amount of energy we delivered so the

65
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,810
difference in a measurement but that's

66
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,669
not enough because if as a consumer we

67
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,859
only register our numbers every year in

68
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:59,730
the mean time we don't have any real

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,500
significant energy storage so if there's

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
an imbalance we have to solve it right

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
away the supply and demand and it's a

72
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,930
real time struggle that's going on in

73
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,359
the grid so we have grid operators who

74
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,769
maintain the stability of the grid

75
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:14,650
supply and demand and associated with

76
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,950
that is a market and so while back a

77
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,959
decades back they came up with a

78
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,690
standard to supply energy data which is

79
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,810
a D LMS cause I'm in the Europe and the

80
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,470
obese codes listed below define very

81
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,930
specific measurement points you might be

82
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,060
interested in if you're going towards

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,250
smart meter energy data this is

84
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,229
something to look out for because this

85
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,079
is sort of the guideline on how to

86
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,780
interpret everything you're getting it's

87
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,970
very old it's not like Jason it's

88
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,099
different but luckily there are

89
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,319
libraries available if you can't make

90
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,349
sense of it but this is all finally good

91
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,109
this is the old world and now we're

92
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,120
getting into renewables so this happens

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,790
and more importantly this is happening

94
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,099
where solar panels are put on the roofs

95
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,069
of consumers individual houses may be

96
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,290
small windmills and energy has been

97
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,739
generated everywhere and now especially

98
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,978
in Germany to the point where in 2015 we

99
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,589
were very tied tied to a chair I was on

100
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,750
the desk having a separate laptop just

101
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,950
watching the grid because there was a

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,450
eclipses solar eclipse so at a certain

103
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,300
point the last part of the generation

104
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,949
the solar panel generation would drop

105
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,289
and after about half an hour it would

106
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,930
come back but we need to match supply

107
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,449
demand instantly so how do we manage

108
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,220
demand there was a lot of things we did

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,479
beforehand but this is something to

110
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
watch out for we have to maintain a

111
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,580
continuous balance so this is a previous

112
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,069
week in Germany and what you can see

113
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,960
here is this is the energy being

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,060
generated so at the top you see the

115
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,919
orange Peaks there is solar energy at

116
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,419
the beginning of the week there wasn't

117
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,880
much solar there also wasn't much wind

118
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,849
which is the green queenís one but then

119
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,169
in the end of the week when it's less

120
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,360
energy usage there was more solar moment

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,650
and in to compensate there was more coal

122
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,520
and other fossil fuels being used in the

123
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,680
beginning of the week and this then

124
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,229
translates surprise you see the blue and

125
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,840
the red lines which are the prices the

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,289
day before the day begins people can bid

127
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,400
energy they can supply and also or gonna

128
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,520
use and in the day itself people can

129
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,000
also go to the market so we have a

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,150
mismatch we have low solar wind power

131
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,860
so therefore the prices are high in it

132
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,490
then it's valid

133
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,770
viable to to start up the power plants

134
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,449
the conventional ones and our parties

135
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,960
who go into this price difference and I

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,669
think one of the first part it was in

137
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,120
2009 UK there was I would say a lock in

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,280
fridge was a fridge tied to the Internet

139
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,940
and in this case and power would

140
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,280
determine when to switch it on and off

141
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,349
it would maintain a very constant

142
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,570
temperature but they would be in control

143
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,050
and now this year in Belgium there'll be

144
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,979
a similar project with boilers and they

145
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,320
estimate to roll out 10,000 boilers

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,699
connected to the internet which are

147
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,310
controlled by restore and they then have

148
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,370
effectively 25 megawatt to control to

149
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,150
the grid and to go to the market with

150
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,259
but what does that mean for me as a

151
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:41,830
consumer well I want to participate in

152
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,919
the market I need a flexible pricing

153
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,810
and therefore freakin billing because

154
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,520
the prices fluctuate therefore I need a

155
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,189
frequent readout and thus in in the IT

156
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,509
world of the day we need a digital

157
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,699
remote readout which is the smart meter

158
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,639
that's coming along and in Europe most

159
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,139
of the countries are doing that this is

160
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,560
a report from 2014 to say how far we are

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,990
and what the different countries are

162
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,029
doing for example in Germany they are

163
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,490
pretty limited in the rollout and not a

164
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,189
country stay for a much further and this

165
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,840
is the timeline by which they are doing

166
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,669
it so most of the countries in the

167
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,710
europe are already pushing out smart

168
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,169
meters now one of the first was sweden

169
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,210
an experience there is that they

170
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,159
introduced monthly billing instead of

171
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,370
yearly and now even they offer hourly

172
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,680
billing so it's a much more frequent

173
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,159
market people can participate in of

174
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,629
course there are privacy concerns this

175
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,159
is a poster from a campaign in the

176
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,259
Netherlands about the smart meter spying

177
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,330
on people and this is a real concern

178
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,759
because but do you know what they are

179
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
reading because it's a wireless uplink

180
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,960
right maybe there are policies in place

181
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,599
but still so luckily in the Netherlands

182
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,339
and also been in Belgium and Luxembourg

183
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:57,099
we have a p1 port which is a serial port

184
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,009
but which the readings are spit out as

185
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,680
well in addition and in the UK we have

186
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,259
this Sigma smart energy so locally you

187
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,719
can put a display and read it out you're

188
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,240
not dependent on just the energy company

189
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,520
and so I practice if you want to do

190
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,860
something with energy data on the one

191
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,110
hand you have the the verified chain

192
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,300
it's on the top where you have the smart

193
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,960
meter reporting back to the backend and

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,129
their bills draft it and inside is given

195
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,919
but there's a low latency we all don't

196
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,750
have much bandwidth in the telecom

197
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,479
industry not enough or not cheap enough

198
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,698
for the smart meters so what we do also

199
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,919
in practice if you want to do something

200
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,019
with energy data if you have something

201
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,630
in house collecting energy data you

202
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,540
already use it there or you put it on

203
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,760
your own back end do some analysis maybe

204
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,709
this aggregation that's where you look

205
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,040
at patterns to see what the different

206
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,860
devices are using and then you display

207
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,259
it there in Germany they have a

208
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,309
quite different model where they because

209
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,939
they are not a very large distribution

210
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:09,879
system operators so every region has a

211
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:15,009
small grid operator and so the various

212
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,509
meters involved so what they do is they

213
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,779
make a small communication device which

214
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,509
is a smart meter gateway this connects

215
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,850
to the meters that are available

216
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,699
connects locally for a readout and to

217
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,230
the Internet to the energy supplies but

218
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,879
what's in the top-left corner or in the

219
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,619
bottom-left corner is the CNS the

220
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,449
Cutrona belowed system so this energy

221
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,209
device has a potential to switch or

222
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:44,709
direct energy data some appliances so

223
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,749
maybe your solar panels the energy

224
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,519
company could potentially switch them

225
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,839
off if they're allowed to in the right

226
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,379
authorizations or prevent they're given

227
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,809
so then you come to the real need for a

228
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,519
home energy management system this is

229
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,679
the scientific term you need something

230
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,629
in your house which is using a

231
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,809
controlling your energy usage and if you

232
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,009
want to do something with flexibility

233
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,980
this is a very strict and good framework

234
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,230
but how to define it you have something

235
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,749
uncontrollable which is statistics solar

236
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:15,730
panels maybe your computer usage you

237
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,739
want to use it whatever it takes you

238
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:19,809
have something in which you can shift in

239
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:21,249
time because this is a given pattern

240
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,410
like a washing machine and you can delay

241
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,660
it for a couple of minutes you have

242
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,999
something which is having energy stored

243
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,410
at just a temperature you have to

244
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,989
maintain you can vary a lot with when

245
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:34,360
you put it on switch it on or off and

246
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,649
you can also store in a battery of

247
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,199
course and there's the unconstraint

248
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:39,639
where you can say okay I have a diesel

249
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,199
generator I can switch it on whenever I

250
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,529
want a colleague of mine he built this

251
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,309
charger for his Tesla and he charges his

252
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,249
Tesla when the solar panels are

253
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,869
generating electricity just by way of

254
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,660
experiment so ideally we'll be in a

255
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,269
world where it's Energy api's everywhere

256
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,850
right we're not there yet but it's

257
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,389
coming and we can use this also this is

258
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,429
an experiment in Brooklyn where they

259
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,980
built a local grid which is balanced

260
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,660
it's a micro grid we call it and they

261
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,080
use etherium integration to provide a

262
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:23,240
local cost way of dealing with cost now

263
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,540
their various protocols frameworks

264
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,820
especially also for price in particular

265
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,990
which you can use if you want to do

266
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,030
something with energy data but to

267
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,700
summarize there's an increased smart

268
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,340
media coverage coming more smart devices

269
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,980
are coming the IOT frameworks we are

270
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,890
available are maturing and there's have

271
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,420
a more API so you can use for

272
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,510
measurement and control and if I look

273
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,140
out I say okay this we have to look for

274
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,820
easier market adoption so people can

275
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,550
join in to the markets that's out there

276
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,740
we need to improve the open standards

277
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,350
and api's that are there because some of

278
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,990
them are lacking in certain places we

279
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,000
need to get those energy management

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,820
systems out to the houses of people and

281
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,740
we have to keep some personal data

282
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,690
Locker where people can store this

283
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,990
precious data especially from years past

284
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,220
because there's a lot of intelligence

285
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,670
you can use to learn your energy usage

286
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,720
so thank you for your attention

287
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,620
maybe that questions

288
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,209
oh you showed that in Belgium you have

289
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,260
second yellow pleat and some some of

290
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,750
them do I think it's heavy F which is

291
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,029
providing smart meters with p1 ports so

292
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,870
it's not all energy companies it's a bit

293
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,930
of spread from the Dutch smart meters I

294
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,399
have two questions one leads to the

295
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,930
other what is the private share of total

296
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:04,370
energy consumption and I'm assuming that

297
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,500
the private Sheriff soul energy

298
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,870
consumption is is fairly low so maybe

299
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,240
who says that that this expensive

300
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,760
rollout is worth it because energy

301
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,220
prices are dropping so maybe maybe it's

302
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,350
simply not worth it to introduce this to

303
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,839
private markets maybe it should only be

304
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,180
industry that uses this market industry

305
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,660
already has facilities to provide a

306
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,029
smart metering and consumer household I

307
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,399
think they are limited in what they take

308
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,680
on from the market in terms of energy

309
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,300
but still there's a we have to get those

310
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,250
renewables and if you want to put solar

311
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,529
panels everywhere we have to involve the

312
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,300
consumers the houses be because we need

313
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,160
property you need land that's the main

314
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,040
thing so we have to incorporate houses

315
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,420
there and therefore we need customer

316
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,630
involvement so the way I see it and so

317
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,450
yeah yeah because that otherwise or you

318
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,190
have companies coming in and renting

319
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,840
your roof that's also a business model

320
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,270
but then it's not up to the consumer

321
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,870
anymore yeah will it be possible for the

322
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,810
consumer to take part in the market so

323
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,700
that's I can zel and achieve and the

324
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,320
prices are high possibly I've got an

325
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,570
electric car with a big battery and then

326
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,690
I store the cheap solar energy and zel

327
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,730
it when it's high so I can I mean

328
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,130
difficult as a consumer you need to be a

329
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,180
business or even are the 50 minute

330
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,830
billing they do in the energy markets

331
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,970
it's not really available there are

332
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,260
organizations stepping up to ease that

333
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,480
East that the opening of the market or

334
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,420
people collaborate and form a community

335
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,580
and then they go to the market maybe

336
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,520
with a white label party in between so

337
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,430
