1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,360
okay so hi thank you for coming

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,790
my name is the captain Yamato and I'm

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,830
interaction designer for next week

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,770
I'm going to talk about the open source

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,990
[Music]

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,199
design feedback it's going to be a panel

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,980
mostly and these are my colleagues from

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,769
I want it to be a very interactive

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,598
session but because we have only twenty

10
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:38,390
five minutes and I will encourage also

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,010
the audience to participate so if you

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,540
want to participate so the questions

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,540
that are being asked because I don't

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,100
know maybe we will not have time to ask

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,369
everybody you can use the QR codes and

16
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,670
the surveys there and we can see also

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,540
what do you think about about the topics

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,970
and the first question are who do you

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,650
represent so that that will be an easy

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,180
question for you like if you are

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,069
designers or developers or other things

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:11,180
and I also start when you in the

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:18,680
community there so hello I'm Bernard

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,620
that guy from just before I'm part of

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,780
the open source design community I and

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,710
using researcher and interaction

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,290
designer and I'm trying to sort of get

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,970
more involved in more open source

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,200
projects that's me I'm young and you

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
probably already know that I'm from the

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,610
previous talk that I mixed toad and I'm

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,190
interaction designer and yeah I'm also

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,830
active in open source design and a few

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:57,320
other open source projects I'm a visual

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,810
designer mostly doing stuff for Mozilla

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,690
and tall project and I'm representing

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,150
where we help many other open-source

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,229
projects with design everyone my name is

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,360
Victoria I am an engineer with the

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,990
interest in usability I represent first

41
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,940
Asia open source design and I try to

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,050
work on volunteer

43
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:32,330
the project this means that it's very a

44
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,840
calibrated attack bomb so the first

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
question that I will ask the panel its

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,560
what do they think that's understanding

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
the designer motivations improves the

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:52,540
feedback designer

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,030
sharing experience or not and for you

50
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,950
guys do you think it's important when

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,170
you provide design feedback to

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,300
understand why the designer it's

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,520
contributing or you want to keep it

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:19,220
professional it doesn't matter so do you

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,620
think that if you know that a designer

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,150
wants money in open source you should

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,040
shoot a different or if you know that

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,100
it's his I don't know doing this problem

59
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,700
you should maybe be more polite to him

60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,910
or is it change the approach for

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:41,720
communities when so I think that design

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,030
contribution no difference from any

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,739
other contribution to open source and

64
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,510
it's very important to play by the rules

65
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,100
of the community so if you are wanted to

66
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,110
be a part of contributor of the open

67
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,600
source projects you need to explain how

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,610
you came to this decision and it's an if

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,780
DIF difficult topic usually so in your

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,450
design especially the most important

71
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,300
process is explained the journey why you

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,160
make these decisions and then you have a

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,140
chance to succeed and make your

74
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,790
contribution accepted I wanted to add

75
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,790
something about that as well so when an

76
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,649
open source project is born there's an

77
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,630
probably there's a need for something

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,060
new and the founders of the project

79
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,820
understand the importance very very

80
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,310
clearly so one of the problems which

81
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,790
comes up

82
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,350
when a designer comes into the game is

83
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,600
that the communication of the importance

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
of the mission of all the whole thing

85
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,010
why the people are doing this is not

86
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,890
translated well to the designer so this

87
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,080
is why there might be a lot of technical

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,660
contributors because they understand the

89
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,910
need for the project while designers

90
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,220
might lack that understanding and I

91
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,690
think there is a gap between the

92
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,860
communication between the technical

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,590
leads of the project and designers

94
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,320
because it's like it's like telling you

95
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
why I love that particular kind of

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,640
coffee it's like no one will understand

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,830
that unless you explain them because the

98
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,660
coffee beans are roasted in that way and

99
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,030
it's because it's Fairtrade bla bla bla

100
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,340
if you talk in that process like you can

101
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,280
you can ah that's why you like that so

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,100
much ok I understand why this is so

103
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,410
important to you and if you are doing

104
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,030
especially if you are doing this pro

105
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,100
bono this is something a designer needs

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:53,270
I think I think it's because we

107
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,980
shouldn't treat design as art of course

108
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,390
because it's quantifiable and it's

109
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,020
basically any design whatever we do like

110
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,610
if they do it full-time if they do it

111
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,440
pro bono or if they're just a volunteer

112
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,770
they're just kind of a voice for for the

113
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,780
user basically or for whoever is using

114
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,600
it in the end so usability is

115
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,120
quantifiable so it doesn't really matter

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,670
in what capacity you contribute to the

117
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,280
project so it's like you're just a

118
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,730
channel for better usability for making

119
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,470
better design happen so that shouldn't

120
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,250
be part of like who you are or why you

121
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,790
contribute to the project

122
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,169
[Music]

123
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,000
project and the options are the owners

124
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,310
how understanding the panel improve the

125
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,960
feedback the community gives one example

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,150
when a committee looks at the design

127
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,720
thing he doesn't think about his users

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,830
he's just providing subjective feedback

129
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,940
so who is the target in open source and

130
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,070
how is that important and how does that

131
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:26,030
reference I think the first question I

132
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,010
think it's probably the world I mean the

133
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:46,280
world contains the users the one that

134
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,250
provides the most no it should also be

135
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,560
the user well it should be the users

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,630
ultimately and and the designer is the

137
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,810
voice of the user the the contributors

138
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,720
who write code also possibly be the

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,210
users possibly so you have to take into

140
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,350
account everybody's feedback I mean I

141
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,090
just think it's important that it's we

142
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,310
don't see like we don't say the target

143
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,260
audience is everyone because then we

144
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,030
don't have particular focus right so we

145
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,830
have to move to first focus on like a

146
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,100
specific group and then maybe maybe

147
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,220
specifically cut that up into into

148
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,970
different groups of target audiences so

149
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,350
yeah I definitely don't think it's the

150
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,080
world because like I don't know not like

151
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,990
internet or something so for example

152
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,909
that right listening of the world

153
00:08:41,909 --> 00:09:10,620
and 14 users I'm not sure if it's on on

154
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,600
topic that I just wanted to add it's

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,730
easy to say for whom we build software

156
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,190
for users but it's very difficult to

157
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,430
follow this and we sometimes assume oh

158
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,460
I'm the user I know everything so if you

159
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,530
build the project just go out and see

160
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,210
people use your product that's the only

161
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,150
one way we can learn so the users

162
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,490
whoever you see using your project and

163
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,780
then you learn and improve so very

164
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,580
specific because if it's the world you

165
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,700
are not surely who your target is are

166
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,490
they advanced users are there normal

167
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,770
users are they from a specific

168
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,690
geographic region and this might be or

169
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,520
not important when you propose something

170
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,510
[Music]

171
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:17,959
so they're the same options from so I

172
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,939
have some personal experience with that

173
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,679
I guess I think I mentioned that before

174
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,859
so when someone asks you at four for

175
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,889
contribution it's hard to understand who

176
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,009
makes a final decision and in doing that

177
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,569
in the beginning right in front can

178
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,509
avoid a lot of misunderstandings in the

179
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,389
in Tulane or because sometimes people

180
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,809
want to work in the open doing requests

181
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,549
an open source design but they want to

182
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,169
have that final decision so if you're an

183
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,549
open source project you are the founder

184
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,379
of the project you want to create it you

185
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,720
want to have the process in the open but

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,009
you want to have the final decision in

187
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,319
the end so ok I can understand that but

188
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,230
that would be great if you can say that

189
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,309
sometimes you want the community to have

190
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,089
the decision so this creates this can

191
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,549
avoid quite a lot of conflicts if it's

192
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,160
in the brief if because open source

193
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,059
design is quite niche yet it's nice to

194
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,469
have a clear communication and

195
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,800
you

196
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:36,160
oh but the designers are not committers

197
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,799
so I believe that community have to

198
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,670
decide always and community will balance

199
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:52,850
itself and so I think it's those who

200
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,989
make the software and those are

201
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:58,819
commuters and designers all together and

202
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,220
they have they as a community make

203
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:09,949
decisions we cannot separate it Thanks I

204
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:12,829
think like in many cases it it it will

205
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,899
ideally become a discussion between all

206
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,769
of these groups

207
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,170
I suppose that like only one of them

208
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,029
only one person is responsible would be

209
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,269
sort of very classic management and I've

210
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,600
hope that in our projects we can have a

211
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,160
discussion together and make sense of it

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:43,879
together I think that design by

213
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,350
committees some is a wait for things to

214
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,350
go certainly wrong there is I think that

215
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,379
there is a one reason yet you might

216
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,629
decide that okay after all the

217
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,179
discussion if you haven't reached some

218
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,179
kind of consensus somebody has to make a

219
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:08,779
final decision and in my opinion that

220
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:15,379
should be the designer and since you

221
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,290
said that I would expect if there is a

222
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,839
design made there was some research are

223
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,730
some testing done with users and I would

224
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,649
look for their data and if there was no

225
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,689
data then it's more difficult but if

226
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,759
you've done usability testing with X

227
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:33,049
number of people here's data there's no

228
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,250
data this is the

229
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,430
fault would be my yeah I mean it's

230
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,110
difficult to make a decision without any

231
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,020
it's just opinion against opinion or if

232
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,210
we treat design as an opinion so yeah

233
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,500
again research basically Trump's these

234
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,780
these factors like objective factors I

235
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,190
just think it's important not to think

236
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,210
of design as an opinion because I mean

237
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,950
you you go to school you learn a

238
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,880
profession and that I mean you can't

239
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,720
always have statistical data saying it's

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,150
a good design it is the profession and

241
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,320
anyone else

242
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,839
the next question is how this time

243
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,839
influenced the feedback process so

244
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,430
something very problematic I've seen his

245
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,640
bike shedding like people talking about

246
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,839
maybe that color should be a bit more

247
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,820
purplish or something but because I like

248
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,910
purple so that's not the right thing to

249
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,820
approach things and bike shedding

250
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,550
generally takes a lot of time and this

251
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,410
waste of time as again I said oh sorry

252
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,830
yeah as again as I said it depends

253
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,960
really only who make takes the decision

254
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,790
so takes it depends on the question

255
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,500
before so the bigger the community or

256
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,260
decision-making committee is the longer

257
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,529
it takes so if it's only one decision

258
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,630
maker obviously it takes much less time

259
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,670
but it's less transparent so it's a

260
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:34,029
compromise always one thing to know it

261
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,339
is done in open source design process

262
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,440
and feedback can take like a couple of

263
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,690
months so even in our community we've

264
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,360
seen proposals that didn't receive for I

265
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,130
don't know five months response etcetera

266
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,190
and for designers can be very hard to go

267
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,350
back in that mindset and remember what

268
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,760
they've been there and create another

269
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,900
iteration time this time also helps to

270
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,060
rethink and get out of maybe you were

271
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,490
stuck in back then so you you can get

272
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,770
removed from like your baby that you

273
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,080
created as a designer and you're so

274
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:19,630
attached to and very important when you

275
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,330
request design work it's to also mention

276
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,850
how much time that designer has to work

277
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,040
or not because for example when

278
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,430
requesting things for free there might

279
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,760
not be an urgency and if you want

280
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,100
something very fast at least until that

281
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,170
designer that I don't know that okay

282
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,660
it's free and it's fine but you need

283
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,520
it's urgent or or not

284
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:52,100
No okay well you want to see what would

285
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,230
be great sometimes like often people

286
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,730
seem to be unsure what they what they

287
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,499
need and that's like super well it if

288
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:58,910
you don't know how to approach a design

289
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,230
problem if you're not a designer

290
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,689
yourself and in that case I think it

291
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,449
would help for example communities like

292
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,130
like ours a lot of people who will be

293
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,319
just frank about it and say I would like

294
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,609
to have that improve but I don't know

295
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,669
know why so please first help me to to

296
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:19,519
make a good decision about that I think

297
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,119
that's really important because design

298
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,470
isn't just about going away and doing

299
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,720
something in a in your time coming back

300
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,940
and saying here it is it's also talking

301
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,320
with the people who have asked you and

302
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,090
if they don't know what they need then

303
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,220
it's your job to go back to the start

304
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,360
and say okay what is it that you're

305
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,039
looking for and let's talk in the

306
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,149
simplest of language and then you get to

307
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,470
the point where you've got a better

308
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,779
understanding of the design thing that

309
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:45,980
you're trying to do okay now I

310
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,940
understand and it'll save pain and hurt

311
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,559
make a summary of the things we discuss

312
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,960
and it was if you were to pick one of

313
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,849
the factors that it's the most important

314
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,389
design process which one would be and

315
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:10,119
the options were knowing who is the

316
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,759
decision maker and or knowing what is

317
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,259
the motivation for designer or

318
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,609
understanding the need

319
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,379
knowing the target knowing time

320
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,419
constraint or any other thing and

321
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,139
currently for example the most important

322
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,999
factor from the other audience they

323
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,340
consider to be the need so understanding

324
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:34,239
first so talking to people yeah I mean

325
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,549
like of course I agree it's the need but

326
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:41,289
unfortunately the reality is that you

327
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,239
actually don't have time to do usability

328
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,249
testing especially in open source so

329
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,799
unfortunately it ends up being just a

330
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,320
whole bunch of opinions of a whole bunch

331
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,029
of people on your issue tracker so I

332
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:55,149
think that's actually a good point that

333
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:56,799
understanding the need is the most

334
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,289
important point and do usability testing

335
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,799
or or any kind of testing is a very very

336
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,470
important thing in design as a whole but

337
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,840
especially in open source projects yes

338
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,059
been mentioned before it's in think it's

339
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,009
the most important thing is that design

340
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:16,509
not to treat design as an opinion

341
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,840
because like people look at it as a form

342
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,929
of art which it isn't so for example you

343
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,789
cannot say I like rap so let's make the

344
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,830
logo red because you need to understand

345
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,059
that Brett might be aggressive

346
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,129
it might in some countries it might have

347
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,470
a different meaning you might want to

348
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,629
know that sans-serif as font is

349
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,519
different than serif fonts because blah

350
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,029
blah blah so you gotta have arguments I

351
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,609
think I can understand if you don't have

352
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,119
the background to to get that but

353
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,960
comments like I love it or I hate it

354
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,289
because man are kind of like

355
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,659
unconstructive so I think this kills the

356
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,919
process of feedback

357
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,669
the feedback process stops and the

358
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,229
audience has options like after X number

359
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:24,849
of votes or when the committee decides

360
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,369
to when the designer decides to after a

361
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:40,059
number of iterations so the main

362
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,919
questions was do you need to do like

363
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,839
accelerations or do you need to wait

364
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,209
like seven months or do you need to make

365
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,829
the designer happy do you need to make

366
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,769
the commuters happy in the world or I

367
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:54,579
don't know I mean if we talk about it on

368
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,929
a broader scale I think the feedback

369
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,119
process never stops because software is

370
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,299
ever-changing and so that but that also

371
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,859
helps because we say okay what's the

372
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,469
best for like the next half year or

373
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:11,379
what's the best for right now and then

374
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:14,259
we also have things for more future

375
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,389
iterations so I think yeah at the same

376
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:18,279
time it's it's good to realize yeah this

377
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,229
will change in the future maybe anyway

378
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,759
and five years ago it looked much

379
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,669
different and decision to say this is

380
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:28,779
going to change in the future maybe

381
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,549
anyway but we can always weave so we can

382
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,109
always revisit it but for now and that's

383
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:34,419
let's decide on something which works or

384
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,449
not

385
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:45,939
the winner is when owners are happy so I

386
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:52,809
think that it's very important to know

387
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,429
that there should be time for several

388
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,499
iteration because the first result would

389
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,879
never the belt it would be never the

390
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,069
best one so when you plan to design

391
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,269
something just just accept the idea that

392
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,789
it's good go for several iteration and

393
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,679
even if you are not happy with the first

394
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,369
one move on and an iterate again so the

395
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,380
process never stops because we

396
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,090
Pro software constantly and it never

397
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,590
gets to the best point because

398
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,570
everything is changing software has to

399
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,890
change as well so process never stops I

400
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,330
strongly disagree with this result I'm

401
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,650
sorry I just want to do a comparison

402
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,390
with that like there's a reason there is

403
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,160
a CTO there's another reason there's a

404
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,920
creative fleet so imagine like a

405
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,290
designer taking on the CTO position hey

406
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,700
I don't like this line of code like

407
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,860
please do don't do it like that I don't

408
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,040
like that so it's the equivalent of the

409
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,590
owners not liking or liking the decision

410
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,100
so if you have asked a designer to help

411
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,380
you what's the point of asking a

412
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,730
designer when you're doing the decision

413
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,250
yourself anyway right you just need a

414
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,110
robot to implement the design for

415
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,850
something which you have in mind because

416
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,880
that's not it how design works so I

417
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,810
think like everyone has their own skills

418
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,600
and this should be respected of course

419
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,820
in a more open and transparent way so

420
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,810
let's yeah that's it nutshell so i sorry

421
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,180
I completely disagree with this result

422
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,300
as well the software is being developed

423
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,580
I presume for users the designers

424
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,960
opinion doesn't really matter if the

425
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,700
users are happy with the software and

426
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,680
they're using it more and there are more

427
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,320
users and everybody is happy that's when

428
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:50,020
that's my opinion thank you thank you so

429
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,060
much we also have the please provide

430
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,230
feedback for the sessions

431
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:04,069
