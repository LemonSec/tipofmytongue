1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,070
good morning

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,210
[Music]

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:09,750
I'm feel requests ear I'm working at the

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,850
free university of brussels but not this

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,530
one not the french-speaking one but the

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,789
Flemish Fork of it

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,250
main campus being one kilometer from

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,160
here I'm one of the founders of the Open

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,630
Patent Office and of course people that

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,480
love freedom of software and openness

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,529
are not really so happy with the grant

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,370
the state granted monopolies patents are

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,170
state granted monopolies

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,270
besides the ethical issues it's also a

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,120
big problem practically it's very hard

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,490
to write software or to even develop a

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,660
web shop without violating any of these

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,630
20 patents covering web shops some

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,270
patterns are too stupid to be true for

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,570
example slide to unlock is actually a

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,099
software implementation of a

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,149
centuries-old ID it's not only in the

23
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,460
patterns in the software world that's a

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,060
problem in the medicine in the medical

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,600
world patients are dying like Richard

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,020
Stallman set if you lobby for patent

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,530
enforcement on expensive life-saving

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,939
drugs in poor countries

29
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,490
you should be charged for genocide

30
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:35,210
in the mobile world everybody's attacked

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,439
by orders with patterns and if you're a

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,579
big company you can probably make a deal

33
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,350
with cross licensing or you can

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,000
contribute quite new problem is actually

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,030
the patent trolls you can't make a deal

36
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,770
with them you can't counter to them

37
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,530
because they are non-practicing entities

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,659
they produce nothing they sell nothing

39
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:07,250
so you cannot attack them patterns are

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,650
not cheap to obtain maybe you say ok I

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,120
don't like patterns so they shouldn't be

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,590
cheap that should be extremely expensive

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,829
but this is a problem for small

44
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,129
organizations and individual what about

45
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,860
fair competition the big costs okay

46
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,680
there are renewable well there are

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,610
registration cost for patterns the

48
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,000
renewal cost for patterns but B cost is

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
your legal cost for a legal adviser to

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,970
write the pattern such that they are not

51
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,980
invalidated by prior art so you don't

52
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,350
write too broad but also don't write too

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,030
narrow because you want to block the

54
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,599
competition as much as possible well

55
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,780
probably not you you but the

56
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,489
organizations that try to get patterns

57
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,810
so also patterns are written in a

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,370
difficult legal language nowaday okay

59
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,190
it seems that with these curves together

60
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,970
with certainly with litigation costs

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,010
actually the average profit of a pattern

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,630
today is less than zero except in the

63
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,889
chemical pharmaceutical sector and

64
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,680
that's because a molecule is easy to

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,970
define exactly in other sectors or stuff

66
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,720
is defined more loosely and that raises

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,910
a lot of more ground for conflicts so

68
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,370
it's a pattern the good ID for you take

69
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,160
this into account

70
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,480
so actually patterns are a tax on

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,510
innovation some researchers say that at

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,630
least

73
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,200
a tax that is at least tax of around 12%

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,220
on innovation the biomedical sector some

75
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,000
researchers say patterns are actually

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,100
slowing down innovation with around 30

77
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,660
percent also patents nowadays are too

78
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,990
vague to learn from patent lovers will

79
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,120
say yeah patterns are a trade-off

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,560
between giving a little bit of monopoly

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,160
during a little bit time 20 years for in

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,290
return getting the knowledge of the

83
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,750
companies to avoid that they keep

84
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,529
everything secret and they will say

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,330
patent databases are huge knowledge

86
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,780
databases even in my university patent

87
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,850
officers say don't forget to look for

88
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,420
knowledge in the patent databases but

89
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,240
actually researchers don't do that

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,520
because patent databases did you try to

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,970
read a patent patents are almost

92
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,890
impossible to understand so it's time to

93
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,080
fix patents since long according to many

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,760
so let's see what kind of solutions

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,980
exist and if this is enough thumbs up if

96
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,620
you love before good patent reform like

97
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,980
abolishing software patents it's a long

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,550
struggle if you have patents a good idea

99
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,160
is to join patent pool a defensive

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,060
patent pool one around Linux is the open

101
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,160
invention network on the picture you see

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,090
the application with a very active

103
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,090
speaker from a speaker at FOSDEM there

104
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,740
is somebody else from the open invention

105
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,330
network in the room so great idea there

106
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,400
was the previous speaker another defense

107
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,760
is patent pool a lot network good if you

108
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,000
have patents what can you do to avoid

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,910
patents you want to avoid that somebody

110
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,640
else gets a patent on your ID I loved

111
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,220
this previous speaker mentioning that

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,040
there was initiative to kill patents

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,140
before they are granted in the

114
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,260
application phase in the US I hope he's

115
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,990
right because there used to be the peer

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,660
to patent initiative and that is a

117
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,080
historic initiative of the United States

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,330
Patent Office so I hope there's still a

119
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,770
way to do it during the application

120
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,250
phase but I'm not sure quite new

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,370
initiative is unpatented they want to

122
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,080
crowdsource IDs for invalidating bad

123
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,210
patterns so if you think okay I don't

124
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,370
like that patent you mentioned them

125
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,610
please attack that patent and then they

126
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,710
will do a fundraising if they have

127
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,700
twenty thousand dollars they will start

128
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,240
the procedure to invalidate that patent

129
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,560
if you don't have a patent yet but you

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,900
have a great idea and you bring it to

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,880
market be careful your risk to lose your

132
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
freedom to operate if somebody else gets

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
a patent on your ID because they have

134
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,980
the same idea because they see you is

135
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,650
simply doing it they could get the

136
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,800
patterns and it could block you there

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,450
was a question at the previous

138
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,660
presentation after the vision

139
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,520
presentation what can I do then should I

140
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,630
take a patent not in this sector but you

141
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,230
could write a defensive publication just

142
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,430
describe how your ID works you make an

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,710
enabling publication and you make sure

144
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,680
that the patent offices can find it so

145
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,500
not just on your website because then

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,050
they will not even trusted that you

147
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,040
didn't cheat with the date and so more

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,290
but also don't just put it in your code

149
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,300
because patent offices are not reading

150
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,650
your source code they are also not

151
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,320
trying your programs so we need

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,570
something better there exist commercial

153
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,820
initiatives for that research disclosure

154
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,970
is a journo

155
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,830
they have around thousand publications

156
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,350
per year which is actually nothing

157
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,590
compared to the

158
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,270
million patents worldwide every year and

159
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,730
they have publication fees per page so

160
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,190
most of these defense publications are

161
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,370
very short to pagers and they have a

162
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,560
paywall for readers so no open access

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,660
another one IP dot-com very similar

164
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,180
10,000 publications per year so very

165
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,830
small compared to the number of patents

166
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,400
yearly publications feed and a paywall

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,179
a great initiative was the defensive

168
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,610
publications projects by Linux defenders

169
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,940
they collected with your help

170
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,370
defensive publications around Linux

171
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,770
software a little bit broader than Linux

172
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,140
only the pro and they submitted it to IP

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,120
comm where you have to pay the

174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,580
publication fees but they did this for

175
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,780
free with sponsor II so no pay wall also

176
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,760
to read because I republished it the

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,370
problem is they only got hundred

178
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,100
fifty-six publications since 2009 and

179
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,930
the last one was in January 2015 I

180
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,690
mailed them okay I love your initiative

181
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,980
but what happened we want to do

182
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,560
something similar the email came back

183
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,120
bouncing so if there's somebody who

184
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,190
knows about this project and the status

185
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,210
please tell me so none of the current

186
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,880
defensive publications solutions have

187
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
the popularity the impact or the

188
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,250
openness that a concept deserves if I

189
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,610
talk with well actually if you talk with

190
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,140
whatever people for example in the

191
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,780
street and you ask what is the patent

192
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,220
everybody has a quite good idea they

193
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,200
know this kind of a proof that you

194
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,840
invented something but of people about

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,690
defensive publications even researchers

196
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,110
they don't know they don't know the

197
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,250
concept they don't know the term so we

198
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,860
need something better our proposal is

199
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,200
the open Patent Office which is a

200
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,810
nonprofit organization so we don't ask

201
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,410
money for publishing or for reading

202
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,250
and our aim is to stimulate open

203
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,770
innovation and to strain the public

204
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,220
domain and we do this by combining the

205
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,410
best practices of the defensive

206
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,550
publications and the patent offices

207
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,300
patent offices the strong practice is

208
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,240
all that registration the bookkeeping of

209
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,790
at one date was what registered and open

210
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,090
discussions none of the previous

211
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,310
projects added that with each ID we add

212
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,540
the possibility to discuss these IDs

213
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,930
because if I this talk they become

214
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,770
smarter

215
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,610
if IDs have sex new IDs are being born

216
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,690
so we want to stimulate this so our

217
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,150
motto is protect your freedom to operate

218
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,150
by sharing your IDs you don't get the

219
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,650
full protection of patents including the

220
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,150
aggressive possibilities to block others

221
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,630
but at least you have that defensive

222
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,730
protection others will not be able to

223
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,260
get patents on your ID anymore so we

224
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,690
want to help you with an easy

225
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,910
publication process on the website you

226
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,040
will have a guided web forum where you

227
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,620
simply mention the title some

228
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,870
information about yourself or if you

229
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,380
desire to stay anonymously that is

230
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,100
possible

231
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,830
not with patents but with open patents

232
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,620
yes you give an abstract a summary

233
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,590
background problem statement you

234
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,860
mentioned prior art very important

235
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,240
patents should also do that but are

236
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,090
sometimes trying to avoid to give the

237
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,210
crucial prior art given an enabling

238
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,760
description that's the most important

239
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,220
part you need to give a full description

240
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,620
that so that somebody else can implement

241
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,720
your ID add figures if relevant if you

242
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,180
push the publication button you get

243
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,680
immediate publication of course it's a

244
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,160
very important that the patent offices

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,760
trust us so we will guarantee the

246
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,090
fantasy and the date by a date stamp and

247
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,830
then we can do much better than others

248
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,750
by for example giving cryptographic

249
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,750
hashes of the open patterns keep the

250
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,550
graphic signatures blockchain is

251
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,980
probably overkill and we can let others

252
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,070
do mirroring of our database we need to

253
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,380
make it easy for the patterned offices

254
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,560
the traditional patent offices to find

255
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,990
or defensive the publication's so we'll

256
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,240
give them surgeon shine tags and API to

257
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,740
integrate our software we will also

258
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,750
follow the international pattern

259
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,750
classification not easy even me the

260
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,880
first time when I try to search for

261
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,410
software patterns in the national

262
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,540
pattern classifications I didn't feel

263
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,910
find them immediately they are hidden

264
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,910
under business methods

265
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,670
we give eras s feet so that innovators

266
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,230
that want to follow something about

267
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,480
their own sector can easily do that and

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,160
we facilitate of course citations we

269
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,920
want to improve the quality because of

270
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,480
course palmer's will also like our

271
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,930
platform so we will stress the

272
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,910
importance of having a good enabling

273
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,330
description we'll do quality control

274
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,820
post publication and this will probably

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,840
still need some research how to do this

276
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,990
in the best way and we will give quality

277
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,510
metrics and open patterns that get more

278
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,290
citations of course is probably a better

279
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,300
open patent than other one

280
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,040
you hear me mentioning open patents and

281
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,740
an open patent is actually not a patent

282
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,020
it's like you is not Unix but the idea

283
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,470
is what I said everybody knows about

284
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,390
patterns nobody knows about the fancy

285
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,000
publications so I think we will be more

286
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,510
popular with this little hack we give it

287
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,750
just a more sexy name and it's all for

288
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,210
stimulating open innovation so we want

289
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,520
of course open access we will put a

290
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,990
Creative Commons license

291
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,230
on the text so that text can be reused

292
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,960
for but also that our database can be

293
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,260
mirrored by others the IDs by publishing

294
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,660
them with us are in the public domain so

295
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,380
there is no thing like a patent license

296
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,420
on these IDs right these are in the

297
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,820
public domain and then we facilitate

298
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,940
comments on these IDs discussions maybe

299
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,370
we enable requests for prior arts and

300
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,570
enable request for solutions for certain

301
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,830
problems but that's not the core

302
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,920
business maybe we can link to

303
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,620
initiatives like ask patents and stock

304
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,200
exchange okay and we want to empower

305
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,529
innovators patent holders are very proud

306
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,330
of their patents there right in their

307
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,880
resumes and their CVS and we want to

308
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,390
give something similar they get a u.s.

309
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,700
patent number a European patent number

310
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,800
whether they will get an open patent

311
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,950
number that I can cite everywhere and we

312
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,300
will give rankings like the most active

313
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,850
open patent holder so actually open

314
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,920
patents are defensive publications but

315
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,380
probably people will mostly like to know

316
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,350
how to open patents compared with

317
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,230
patents so first of all patterns are

318
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,140
expensive to obtain registration or

319
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,110
renewal fees no fees for open patents

320
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,540
writing a patent is difficult because

321
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,490
you need to avoid existing prior art

322
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,170
writing open pattern is very easy

323
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,350
because actually this trying to

324
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,860
establish

325
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,410
prior art and prior art is not

326
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,740
invalidated by prior art so if you

327
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,790
forgot something some prior art it's not

328
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
a problem

329
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,529
patterns are often very hard to

330
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,829
understand written in vague legalese we

331
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,769
hope that the open patterns will be much

332
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,630
easier to understand because you don't

333
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,660
have the strategic game of blocking the

334
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,500
competition right well obtaining a

335
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,440
patent is a slow process can often take

336
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,649
a year before you get your pattern

337
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,809
finally granted here you will get

338
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,459
immediate publication when you push the

339
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,890
publication button patterns their

340
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,199
protection is territorial it means you

341
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,660
need to ask a patent in every country

342
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,230
where you want to have protection an

343
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,400
open patent is of course immediately

344
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,700
international if you publish your ID it

345
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,309
can be found everywhere it will be

346
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,270
accepted everywhere as prior art of

347
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,120
course patents give you both defensive

348
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,030
and offensive protection and open

349
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,390
patterns only give you defensive

350
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:49,240
protection so status we are in

351
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,610
pre-launch phase only we have a

352
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,330
pre-launch website we are preparing to

353
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,020
build for now a prototype website where

354
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,980
you can at least file your IDs but not

355
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,100
with all the features of the

356
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,080
cryptographic hashes and so more in the

357
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,850
beginning because of course this will

358
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,140
need funding it's a nonprofit

359
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,200
organization with the on-task

360
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,240
publication fees we will ask donations

361
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,360
if you can help is it financially or

362
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,390
with developing or whatever if you are

363
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,799
enthusiast please contact us challenges

364
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,040
will be besides funding acceptance

365
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,770
acceptance by innovators please help us

366
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,440
if you have innovative IDs start writing

367
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,730
them out

368
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,220
and acceptance by the software by the

369
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,519
traditional patterned offices of course

370
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,159
we need to avoid spam and I'm also a bit

371
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,450
worried about all the and

372
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,980
pseudoscientific

373
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,470
to submission that we will get but the

374
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,299
pattern surfaces are also getting them

375
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,260
and they are also publishing too often

376
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,730
further scientific patents if things get

377
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,149
multilingual which there should be is

378
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:10,850
this problem is even gonna be harder how

379
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,700
to detect Chinese but the

380
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,130
patent offices also have that problem if

381
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,070
an idea is polished somewhere in Chinese

382
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,700
will an english-speaking Patent Office

383
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,429
always find this I don't think so and

384
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,000
then writing in the European patents is

385
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,049
easy but putting good metadata on it

386
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,019
especially adding international

387
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,820
practically international patent

388
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,450
classification metadata on it is not so

389
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,720
easy to do with crowdsourcing so we're

390
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,610
still finding solutions sourcing

391
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,450
solutions for that so I'm curious for

392
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,320
your questions your comments may be

393
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,570
support you can find us there on your

394
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,690
favorite platform I hope at least the

395
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,820
most popular platforms are there

396
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,190
[Music]

397
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,499
hello first a disclaimer I'm a cobra my

398
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,879
work with the open adventure network so

399
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm was the guy that said yes these

400
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,959
these talks are exactly what we need

401
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,839
one comment upfront I would like us to

402
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,999
be aware that we're living in a filter

403
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:30,219
bubble we are in some form a minority

404
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,929
but we probably all here agreed at

405
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,209
patents on software a difficult issue

406
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,249
if you leave foster and you talk to

407
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,629
other people in Brussels you'll get

408
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:42,079
blank stares I spoke at a conference at

409
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,690
the joint research center the European

410
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,869
Commission in March on the dangers of

411
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,789
patents on software in a room of 300

412
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,679
people I was the only one speaking from

413
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,249
this angle which means we need to get

414
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:55,729
engaged

415
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:57,709
also with lobbying and with spreading

416
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,959
the word for example the economist

417
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,459
articles that he quoted do not really

418
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,999
support what you're saying yet the

419
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:09,559
question comes ideon they're not caught

420
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,499
for polishing the patent system and

421
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:14,509
there's no the consensus that depends to

422
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,669
me surface ban i think the terminology

423
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,789
is important he does he set defensive

424
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,489
publications and the issue with linux

425
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,099
defenders is the new furnaces still

426
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,989
there sits nobody's writing defensive

427
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,519
publications and this is kind of my

428
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,109
question is that you want to make it

429
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,059
more interesting by giving it a better

430
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,599
name have you got responses on from the

431
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,579
open source community but we are

432
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:38,719
interested in not you submitting and

433
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,009
writing because that was our main

434
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,379
problem I spent ages annotating for that

435
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:45,079
and it just we never got ta responses

436
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,409
from that yeah good remark maybe filter

437
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,929
bubble but on the other hand I talked a

438
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,239
lot with researchers in my universities

439
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,940
from different fields and actually they

440
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,329
are none of well-known I didn't

441
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:03,529
encounter researches that are fans of

442
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,789
patents their job is sharing knowledge

443
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,200
so they don't like the restrictions of

444
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,440
patterns of course what they like is the

445
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,709
big money that could come from them but

446
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,979
they are quite realistic the patent

447
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:21,679
officers in the universities are more

448
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,760
optimistic about the possibilities

449
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,430
the patterns always remind us don't

450
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,860
forget the possibilities of peasanty so

451
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,280
yeah researchers like this idea and I

452
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,170
have researchers that say hi okay I'm

453
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,000
gonna start writing patterns for example

454
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,290
the people from mathematics mathematics

455
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,650
is not example and they feel like why

456
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,530
not and they love this idea like okay I

457
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,410
can write out my DS at least at at the

458
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,000
Oakland Patent Office because we will

459
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,790
not restrict anything because it doesn't

460
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,470
harm if you write a defensive

461
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,960
publication so yeah I am optimistic also

462
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,150
because for example I talked to some

463
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,960
patent attorneys and they say okay only

464
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,630
now I get it after your talk about open

465
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,030
Patent Office that actually repattern

466
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,850
torn is very often have to tell our

467
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,260
clients like okay for this ID going for

468
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,990
a patent is not the best strategy and

469
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,720
then they do nothing and then the

470
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
parallel goal is now think like okay I

471
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,760
should mention more this defensive

472
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,660
publication a possibility so I think yes

473
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,690
we have two million patents worldwide

474
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,690
every year we have around less than a

475
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,660
percent defensive publications compared

476
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,580
to that I think we can do much much

477
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,010
better okay

478
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,700
it's not about abolishing all patents is

479
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,760
just about making more popular the other

480
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,490
ID making this a game change or making

481
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,310
this the default thing to do in

482
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,260
everybody's mind or at least one of the

483
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,000
options in everybody's mind

484
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,210
yes hi great initiative and I hope it

485
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,480
will survive a long time but as you saw

486
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,450
with the linux defender website there

487
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,420
are circumstances you cannot foresee

488
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,230
so you mentioned blockchain and that it

489
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,620
would be overkill so what I'm saying is

490
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,160
blockchain might be the only way to put

491
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,890
it out there in all eternity well as

492
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,870
long as some computers are running but

493
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,160
and yeah my question is why do you think

494
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,290
blockchain is overkill and why it's not

495
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,760
the solution well in which blockchain

496
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,800
would you put it if you put it in the in

497
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,840
the Bitcoin well if you put it in the

498
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,450
Bitcoin blockchain I think it's not big

499
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,520
enough fast enough maybe if you're very

500
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,660
popular there's a bit overkill that gets

501
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,750
distributed so much if if we have okay

502
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,300
you can have a blockchain a chain of

503
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,030
proof like you calculate the hashes yes

504
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,960
indeed yes well also it costs a bit for

505
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,680
example if you do it with Bitcoin so ok

506
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,830
it's not excluded the ID is a nice ID

507
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,950
this is part of the well the research

508
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,090
behind it do we do blockchain but if we

509
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,830
do that even if we do the cryptographic

510
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,530
hashes we have already the best solution

511
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,360
the other defense publication commerce

512
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,340
provides they don't do that the patent

513
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,830
offices they do don't do that so indeed

514
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,020
these are some other things technical

515
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,390
issues that we can improve a lot on I

516
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,520
try to do this without too much causing

517
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,430
feedback loop so am i right it's

518
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,710
technically a defensive publication with

519
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,910
an easy-to-access interface but

520
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,000
from a technical point of view it's its

521
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,190
defense publication yes

522
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,400
legally the defense publication but we

523
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,100
had a lot more openness than with the

524
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,040
current solutions not just open access

525
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,740
but also open discussion so that people

526
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,870
can discuss okay nice ID but you could

527
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,830
add that we have time for one more

528
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,960
question so people just who had the

529
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,420
questions I have two questions sexually

530
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,670
so first one is simple if if everything

531
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,350
works correctly if everything is

532
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,600
implement it works correctly will those

533
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,480
be accepted as prior art its first

534
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,310
question and second question will it be

535
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,890
easier to implement things avoiding the

536
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,880
multilingual

537
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,310
aspect so take one language let's start

538
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,330
in one language I don't see why if this

539
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,730
is working well it will not be accepted

540
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,670
by the traditional patent offices if

541
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,220
they find your website if they find your

542
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,920
website they could accept it if they

543
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,020
trust that the date is not cheated and

544
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,480
so more any publication in theory they

545
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,970
could accept and with all that trust

546
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,280
that we are trying to build probably

547
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,560
going to be accepted and there exists

548
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,630
something like patent treaty where is

549
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,480
written which sources at least the

550
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
Patent Office you check and we hope we

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,680
can get in that whitelist the second

552
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,320
question the mill to lingual okay that's

553
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,940
not for I guess the first year that's a

554
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,710
bit of challenge but if we are growing

555
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,440
and we have maybe ambassadors in a free

556
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,660
country or in every language this will

557
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,100
be doable and well over a few years

558
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,900
machine translation will be really be

559
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,910
improving and that will probably also

560
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,270
help

561
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,700
you
