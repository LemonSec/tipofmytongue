1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,830
the morning to see you here today

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,150
hope the source is not always about

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,189
serious business it can also be fun and

4
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,439
today we have two speakers from Germany

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,520
introduced the appendages predicts its

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:01:05,108
name and that's we try to figure out

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,590
[Music]

8
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,070
okay

9
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,209
[Music]

10
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,949
[Music]

11
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,490
so this is one of them today for today's

12
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,730
talk will consist of first time I talk

13
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,150
about what very it was this and how you

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,790
can use it and then we will look at how

15
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:41,670
to create and after that we were those

16
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,680
are the common features and future

17
00:02:43,680 --> 00:03:09,390
features liquid again so yeah what is

18
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,200
the basis for the creation of I have

19
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,140
stands for magic reality which is

20
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,470
something which mean with mobility and

21
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,450
long life so it's it's next chance that

22
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,930
we love with some functionalities of

23
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:42,459
Trinity and which way all formats Inglis

24
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,069
is multiples about the idea of each

25
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,719
equation for Afghanistan and it's also

26
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:59,269
very fast so you have multifaceted Sonia

27
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:08,780
and as heart disease you can even

28
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:37,699
beginners can always add some context to

29
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,240
our house

30
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:52,750
and ready to drown seem to get popular

31
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,370
and so with house maybe you could get

32
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,009
started with less pokémon Hall is also

33
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,419
known for Crimea crisis it has just like

34
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,669
us and we wanted to create a feel

35
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,210
eternity poised next to many ideas about

36
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,130
what games rates firstly wants to fit in

37
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,490
my heart is like game and we wanted to

38
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,220
create a flow of ingress so we just

39
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,280
found one make it a framework so we can

40
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:39,639
make as many games as we like and after

41
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,080
some time aside to place 15 the program

42
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
a powerful and we found out that it

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
would be ready to just do God's 1 which

44
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,150
is 2

45
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,430
the result is for immunity which we'll

46
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:18,970
come back to later okay so before I will

47
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,760
about the physical sense its development

48
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:31,070
we will be having individuals dissipated

49
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,320
the basic work of making a game so first

50
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,140
planned the game objects you want life

51
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,690
and he sees and items that spawn and

52
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:54,190
maybe whatever just take a merchant said

53
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,090
[Music]

54
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,120
existence and then you will do the same

55
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:14,660
thing for items put it together so we

56
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,620
have five classes

57
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,050
[Music]

58
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:28,259
the facts this is printed on our

59
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,340
sweaters let's this basically assume

60
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,380
because it's a specific class of culture

61
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,830
and I will give you some time to read it

62
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,979
and think about it what the code does

63
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,240
[Music]

64
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,010
so does anyone have many ideas of what

65
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,860
this class and what it will do in the

66
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,039
game

67
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,370
yes that's right

68
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,540
[Music]

69
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,410
anything else yes

70
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:14,570
yes correct so that's amazing at the

71
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,540
beginning there's a very class which

72
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,440
just read as in it so for every one

73
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,480
available cousin has syphilis nothing so

74
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,430
this is just a pair first direct from

75
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,760
play a classic red one and for special

76
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,670
behavior

77
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,720
let me create an NBC language any try it

78
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,050
and give it a new policy which is the

79
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:57,140
dictionary of speaker text like this

80
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:07,210
group it has too much of the specificity

81
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,720
the name of the text tension and it was

82
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:20,370
automatically activated correctly

83
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,350
[Music]

84
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,470
the Hartwell methods in the NDC class is

85
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,590
fragrant whenever you wrestled a VC and

86
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:35,490
press the talk button we receive by and

87
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,030
the text pops up like Americans

88
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,150
this is how the game goes place the

89
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,620
first thing we should see in the map

90
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,310
that you see on the screen the player is

91
00:10:48,310 --> 00:11:07,930
the yellow key marker you see and to

92
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,050
address into our text message comes up

93
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,670
and it can also affect the game in

94
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,300
various ways like compensatory and

95
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:30,150
checking it's questions like this is

96
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,580
[Music]

97
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,630
this is press on the second

98
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,310
see objects respectively marked at their

99
00:11:52,310 --> 00:12:00,340
corresponding positions in music camera

100
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,190
yesterday hard time developing this

101
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:15,280
signal perfect cottage work so I have to

102
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,020
develop services or design designer

103
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:35,210
words because it's not the neck specific

104
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,230
language is

just like deceased and this is a bit

111
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:52,930
more complex the method the complex and

112
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,930

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,460
actively

160
00:27:21,160 --> 00:28:55,120
we easy

161
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:17,630
you know resource in I believe that

162
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,700
Christy is acne or party system proposed

163
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,610
treatment when I go to sleep I would

164
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,380
like you to spend a little bit this week

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,870
yes hello

167
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,340
the very religious articles wasn't for

168
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,730
high level creation creating your like

169
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,539
immediately get an idea getting people

170
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:15,409
involved immediately the creation the

171
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:21,630
other dimension is there like some kind

172
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,500
of idea or low-level correct

173
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,610
behind these primitives like layer and

174
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:44,490
so on okay we quite follow - principle

175
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,039
there isn't an API that as a lot of

176
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,950
reflection as you can use something like

177
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,760
they are draw writing and then drop the

178
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,120
item

179
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,790
if you don't want to do this I want you

180
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,890
to low-level programming you just use

181
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,980
the title object on the frame we use all

182
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,740
of it as fast as you like it on Titan in

183
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,160
any of the any of the codes anywhere if

184
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,080
it does use whatever this respect the

185
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,910
framework and in every regular so

186
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,150
there's no constant height we do not

187
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:45,980
hide the complexity of the what's

188
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,990
missing inside the said I have to do

189
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,210
something with feet yes and actually

190
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,120
asked it's from Veritas which is that

191
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,450
inform the truth of reality and babies

192
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,720
which is that it for feel so specific as

193
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:14,870
you can with reality what kinda traction

194
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:20,260
is to support those locations because I

195

in case you like within detective Lee

198
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,380
you take with them on the road map

199
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,380
there's an item this says we want to

200
00:32:52,380 --> 00:33:02,330
have locations pickup is that it is

201
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,420
acoustically understands that sequence

202
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,420
to order also of the tree of the

203
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,020
so this basically boils cognitive on the

204
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:33,049
history of the of the pacification sauce

205
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,929
infesting is because it's not and if you

206
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,880
want an issue if you like we will take

207
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,480
this in for coffee

I'm not sure what the future of the

210
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,360
cases is many mobile applications these

211
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,600
days they all just seem to be wrong

212
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,450
maybe with some additions to the Dutch

213
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:03,760
Muslim community was wrong way to do

214

the documentation right now consists of

218
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,900
the mutation hotspots which can be

219
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,859
expected with the we want to put it

220
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:10,849
together

221
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,849
one size API documentation for this and

222
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,130
also some solace for

223
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,150
and there are at least two fully

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,660
after which depend on the authorities of

227
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,819
course there will be a science

228
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:42,750
interpretation page

229
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,250
it specializes in issues of why we chose

230
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:21,990
the public classes yeah yeah it was more

231
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,380
open license but I can understand that

232
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,970
there is such a project and she really

233
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,520
loved it if you really put yourself into

234
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,090
it the first time or we want to make it

235
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,950
open but still have the best protection

236
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,980
for which you can get so as probably the

237
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,050
reason I chose 85 or not yes of Lyon for
