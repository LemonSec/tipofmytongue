1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
I just want to introduce samba to

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,899
[Applause]

3
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,600
[Applause]

4
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,589
[Music]

5
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,860
[Applause]

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,499
[Music]

7
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,119
that's why I had to find a solution it's

8
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,789
a decentralized solution or it was a

9
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:30,599
decentralized solution or federated

10
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,560
solution which has a central fallback to

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,550
you could use multiple identities that

12
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,509
means you could have some different

13
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,759
identities stored in the system and you

14
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,649
could log into websites using those

15
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,860
different identities as identities we

16
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,670
used email address

17
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,150
simples email the persona service

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,580
verified that the email belongs to you

19
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,759
and then it sends this email as

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:15,459
identification to the protocol refused

21
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,980
was easy to implement for website

22
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,620
providers and it was permission less so

23
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,890
websites implementing it did not need to

24
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:42,850
actually ask for permission to use it in

25
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,510
the slides off the slides in the

26
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,540
beginning it's on slide start Cairo with

27
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,600
a K dot 80 just the first entry there

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,010
for stem 2017 so you can actually find

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,680
that and click all the links afterwards

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,570
as well so persona the scale you weighed

31
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,609
small website if it needs some

32
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,430
administration was some dynamic

33
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,760
component dependent on users which I I

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,859
was writing a content management system

35
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,959
or I'm operating a content management

36
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,290
system and some other websites that have

37
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,709
state that needs to be edited and so you

38
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,049
need to login for that what do you need

39
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,030
as a small website needs to be easy to

40
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,209
implement as a website operator you need

41
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,180
to have to trust the identification that

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,680
you get from those logins you want to

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,880
avoid dealing with storing passwords

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,280
because everything can go on there my

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,239
old system storage passwords basically

46
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,069
as plain text and sent them as plain

47
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,050
text via email to users so basically

48
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,160
mistakes you should never do you really

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,140
don't want to care about how to sort

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,360
passwords yourself you want to have some

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,580
solution that's proven to to work and

52
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,580
that's upgradable by the way if newer

53
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,399
standards come out for that you don't

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,870
want to be locked in that's so if one

55
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,890
authentication or identification

56
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,870
provider goes away you want to be able

57
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,350
to still communicate with your users and

58
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,480
switch to something else the good thing

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,710
with persona was as it used email for

60
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,740
for identification to the websites you

61
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,680
still had this email that you can use to

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,780
communicate to users and a lot of other

63
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,420
blogging systems use emails as well so

64
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,630
you can actually identify the same user

65
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,180
by coming to you with the same email

66
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,110
even through a different login system

67
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,260
and I do you want privacy ideally you

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,580
don't want to to tell some third party

69
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,500
who is logging into your web sites when

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,750
because they're then they can watch

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,490
basically everything that's happening on

72
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:23,990
your website so so what what solutions

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,450
do we have I started to think what can I

74
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,120
do for my websites basically to two

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
things I can do everything locally

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,760
inside my website system or I can have

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,100
it done externally locally it sounds

78
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,560
easy to implement but as I said you want

79
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,770
to avoid storing passwords you you need

80
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,140
to find out how to communicate some

81
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,120
verification codes to users and things

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,320
like that it sounds easy to just have a

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,360
password and username that the devil

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,169
comes in the details

85
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,090
must be trusted as a website operator

86
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,280
you probably have to trust yourself

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,990
anyhow it needs to secure passwords you

88
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,030
need to care about that yourself write

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,680
code for that yourself and that's

90
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,630
error-prone and potentially hyperbole if

91
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,669
you don't care what you're doing what

92
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,460
you're doing the extremely providers

93
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,910
have the potential for walking as I said

94
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,400
you may need to use that provider for

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,580
the rest of the life of your website if

96
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,080
you don't don't have anything cater of

97
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
your users that you can use to

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,620
communicate directly with them there's

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,570
potential policy issues as I said here

100
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,250
you're telling these external providers

101
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,699
when people are logging in and the

102
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,860
implementation difficulties is different

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,259
depending on what you use it could be

104
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,330
very easy if they provide even some code

105
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,460
it could be very difficult if the if the

106
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:14,260
API to use it it's very difficult so

107
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,849
which external providers do we have

108
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,650
local is pretty easy I have to write the

109
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,490
code myself weak stone once do we have a

110
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,099
person that has gone away

111
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,199
Firefox account sounds nice that is not

112
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,750
usable for anyone outside of Mozilla so

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,190
it falls out of that after players you

114
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,050
probably know from some websites like

115
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,190
Facebook you see a collection of icons

116
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,940
out there a lot of people call that the

117
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,000
nascar login because it looks like the

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,050
nascar logo you see that solution

119
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,680
to providers open ID connect providers

120
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,889
open ID connect these are standard for

121
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,309
for logins that spaced on earth 2 which

122
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,939
is an authentication protocol that's

123
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:21,550
pretty common now and this like a wealth

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,999
bond like a number of smaller ones that

125
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,909
didn't take off that much but mainly you

126
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,580
nowadays you see us too and and open ID

127
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,130
connect and of course there's the

128
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,929
potential of intermediates and just

129
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,328
mentioning those because Mozilla is

130
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,880
using of Syria for some things it's

131
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,860
that's an intermediate it provides you

132
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,649
in the code for for handling the login

133
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,709
from your sites to them and then they

134
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,449
are talking to actually to the actual

135
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,730
authentication providers and you can

136
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,920
pretty easily configure that runs on

137
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,850
proprietary Sorell Affairs so it's not

138
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,279
really the thing I want to to advertise

139
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,560
on an open source conference but it's

140
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,510
it's something you can use website you

141
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,490
may be able to use something different

142
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,410
and I didn't want to use a proprietary

143
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:28,180
middleman external system that does not

144
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,810
exist yet but is in the works so it's a

145
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,019
future alternative it may deactivates

146
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:40,420
the other district of persona it uses

147
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,800
email authentication it's decentralized

148
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,839
that's not centralized uses password

149
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,579
bless you know login it's speaking open

150
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,040
maybe connect to both the client side

151
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,470
and the what they call brokers the

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,399
identity providers on the different

153
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,860
domains out there and because the

154
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,750
spiritual successor to Mozilla persona

155
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,610
there's a number

156
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,560
people who actually worked on persona

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,029
working on party a as well and in

158
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,480
development you can find more

159
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,339
information at party that gets up the

160
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,740
dial we will be an interesting

161
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,310
alternative once they are in the stable

162
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,709
note that they we're not there yet and I

163
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,240
needed something for my websites right

164
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,760
now so I figured in the website is maybe

165
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,380
not the best solution I don't trust

166
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,620
those external providers too much and I

167
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,010
want privacy from them so what can I do

168
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,560
there well I may be able to just

169
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,450
implement the same thing is for an

170
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,779
external provider on my website and then

171
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,550
basically with the same protocols talk

172
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,560
to something that I still host locally

173
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,440
but at least I have everything

174
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,060
encapsulated there and I call that local

175
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:15,589
external or self hosted external stack

176
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,649
it all runs on my machines the password

177
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,290
security I still need to care about is

178
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,300
at least isolated from the website cold

179
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,589
and it's cold it's hopefully reusable

180
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,320
and that other people can look look into

181
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,709
if it's an open source thing and we can

182
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,910
guarantee that it's a good solution

183
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,140
management of multiple identities is

184
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,630
possible if if a privacy interests are

185
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,300
new issues because I don't leave privacy

186
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,519
for myself I already know who locks into

187
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,500
my websites so I'm not telling that to

188
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,290
anyone else and I hopefully as I said

189
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,130
before I can trust myself and when I'm

190
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,089
using a standard API like f2 or Open ID

191
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,199
Connect there's a good possibility if I

192
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:09,029
find out that's not the solution I

193
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:09,600
wanted

194
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
I can switch it out to some other

195
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,230
solution that uses the same protocols

196
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,690
because I already have to call for that

197
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,370
in the in the website the downside is I

198
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,370
still need to secure the whole system

199
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:33,420
and the passwords properly documentation

200
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,700
how you should do that I can probably

201
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:45,780
look into that so I I know PHP I thought

202
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,600
well that is paris' for os/2 let's let's

203
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,660
do something with this and I created the

204
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,280
PHP off server it's using us gos to API

205
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,850
viable a be a while or to server PHP it

206
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,610
can be extended to open a B connect I

207
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,510
didn't do that yet the password storage

208
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,030
right now happens with the PHP standard

209
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,280
password hash function which uses bcrypt

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,310
which is good enough if used within the

211
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,740
federation's but better algorithms out

212
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,780
there there's a bug report out there on

213
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,150
the PHP pack bug tracker to actually use

214
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,350
something better I try to use a script

215
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,080
but now if there's even better algorithm

216
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,630
that that they propose to use the good

217
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,550
thing is once we have a better algorithm

218
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,730
in PHP the code is in there to

219
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,460
automatically update the security for

220
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,240
everyone on blogging because unlike

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,389
the password you can rien Kripa the

222
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,449
better function I'm also using unions

223
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,990
there that's stored on disk and the

224
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,050
extends the password of the user so if

225
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,759
someone gets the database they can not

226
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,149
do put voice hacking off of those

227
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,249
passwords easily enough because the

228
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,779
nonce on this is needed as well it's

229
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,069
relatively easy to install system as the

230
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,959
codes with Apache MySQL PHP up to PHP

231
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,179
seven which I'm losing using on my local

232
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,129
systems when testing it my service law

233
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:32,350
runs it on PHP five there it breaks both

234
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm using for the database extraction

235
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,100
not all of doctoring but just a database

236
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,059
extraction layer so it should be pretty

237
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,980
easily extendable to other databases the

238
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,230
PHP utility classes are something I did

239
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,110
myself and putting kids have some time

240
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,269
ago that I'm just using that for email

241
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,189
and document abstractions because I'm

242
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,629
HTML document I'm putting out there as a

243
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,670
Dom document and only serializing it

244
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,399
then which makes it much easier to not

245
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,240
forget and text and stuff like that it's

246
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,579
capable to branch the installation for

247
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,600
the operator

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,910
- branded like like you see in the

249
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,189
picture up there with with my logo but

250
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,980
it comes with a neutral one by default

251
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,829
and my information at author care

252
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,009
ability scores pretty well in the

253
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,439
security tests I could run on most of

254
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:34,220
the Observatory on SSL labs some of that

255
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,170
is because of the code some of that is

256
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,399
because of the PHP configuration the

257
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,379
Apache configuration which I have

258
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,600
examples in the in the repository for so

259
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,579
you can just copy from that if you want

260
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:53,709
to use it so current status

261
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,199
oh that runs off the screen because I

262
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:00,040
thought it would be three per for and

263
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,610
it's it's not only support the up in

264
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,089
this variation code flow of of two right

265
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,600
now which means the website sends a

266
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,470
request for for authentication then you

267
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,870
log in there and for for no me login it

268
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,120
implicitly the hence it if your login

269
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,269
since back reply with a nexus codes to

270
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,660
the website on the server side you you

271
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,079
request the token for for that access

272
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,839
code and with that token you can then do

273
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,870
something most importantly get the email

274
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,180
of the user so you have a user and

275
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:56,379
identification interest for which is a

276
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,009
bit less secure doesn't have to this

277
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,529
flow over the server in there but that

278
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,030
makes it less secure because it only

279
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,369
works between browser and in the

280
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,109
authentication server that is not

281
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,179
supported yet but the library can do it

282
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,079
so it should be easy to add the Open ID

283
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,270
Connect staff is also supported by the

284
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,069
library so it's just a question of

285
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,630
adding it apache mysql or actually maria

286
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,510
vp for now it should be easy to extend

287
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,600
that for other web servers and databases

288
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,940
as long as they're supported by the

289
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,760
doctoring abstraction layer and you can

290
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,480
run PHP on them those remain technical

291
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,820
communication in the main repiy it

292
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,150
supports us english and german as

293
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,480
defined by your browser because that's

294
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,740
the two languages i know of or if there

295
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,050
how to to write in testing is is right

296
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,780
now very rudimentary it's just I'm

297
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,520
trying it with my own document

298
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
management system and I'm trying it with

299
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,110
a secondary system I'm I'm running that

300
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,490
has an independent implementation I want

301
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,620
to give special thanks to Crystal Shana

302
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,390
who did review for security issues and

303
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,390
he didn't find at any real security

304
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,309
issues he had a few minor comments that

305
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,970
few of them still need to address but

306
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,850
most of them was nothing special and the

307
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,040
thing that's cut off here it's probably

308
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,960
the most important thing of this whole

309
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,190
slide it's open source it's available

310
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,270
since today since a few hours ago at

311
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,200
speeds up that kind of keio 8000 there

312
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,990
it's under Mozilla Public License two I

313
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,710
care to put a license on my projects

314
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,880
unlike many others on github and yeah

315
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,059
it's it's out there right now if if you

316
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:08,010
want to use something like that it's an

317
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,620
open source project so it is helped by

318
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,070
the way this right there is the

319
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,900
unbounded version you see by default

320
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,580
it's the log in piece of it the my logo

321
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,010
is not in there it's somewhere in the

322
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,350
repository because I started it without

323
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,820
being able to scan it that needs help

324
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,090
there is implementation of especially

325
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,660
Open ID Connect maybe the time

326
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,130
credential flow as well a test suite and

327
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,320
infrastructure to run the tests more

328
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,550
complete documentation no UI languages

329
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,480
would be nice but there's other three

330
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,030
are probably more important than that

331
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,679
but there's still a good thing it's

332
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,740
standard

333
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,590
files so it's easy easy to do the

334
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,650
translations more installations out

335
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,679
there that actually try it and see how

336
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,580
things are liking and of course any of

337
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,450
your ideas and pull requests for it

338
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:23,200
would be very very appreciated that's it

339
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,830
I think we should have time for some

340
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,500
questions

341
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,940
the table is here again and if you want

342
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,980
to contact me that's my email address

343
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,920
and my muscle in CLL that actually has

344
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,640
the few social networks I'm on it has

345
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,010
the links for that and with that are

346
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,640
there any questions

347
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,959
[Music]

348
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:16,059
the question was to provide you with

349
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,580
that yes this this is an implementation

350
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,580
of in the earth to provide some

351
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,530
incomplete because it doesn't have the

352
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,660
client credentials flow it only has the

353
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,160
authorization code flow but yes it is

354
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,860
one you say the hello Cheers

355
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,229
[Music]

356
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,150
okay so it's something that provides

357
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,169
this this role

358
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,289
you can provide it it's a provider of

359
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,409
all those two providers for four

360
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,799
websites I didn't do anything like that

361
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,149
right now the thought behind this is for

362
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,859
people to set up their own tea so I

363
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:10,309
don't want my provider to be one that's

364
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,200
a lot of other people are using

365
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,980
I prefer other people actually using the

366
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,519
same module inventing their own for for

367
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,799
their purposes and not telling anyone

368
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,179
else who's logging in on their website

369
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,340
that's using some common code that can

370
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:42,200
be made secure enough so the question is

371
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,379
if there's any change for Mozilla to use

372
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:49,639
port a I'm not sure you will need to ask

373
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,919
those people at my server who are

374
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,480
implementing sites that are using logins

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,879
likes the idea of 48 or a lot of people

376
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,940
that doesn't have one opinion usually

377
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,179
it's a lot of people I think a lot of

378
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,259
people like the idea but we will see

379
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,820
those when it matures more right now

380
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,399
it's it's in a very early testing mode

381
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,309
but I like the idea as well of course

382
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,149
any other questions

383
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:26,239
oh sure one of the advantages of persona

384
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,029
was that you could log in once and then

385
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:30,700
be logged into a number of websites

386
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,259
federated login right it's single

387
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,809
sign-on do you think that that goal

388
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,649
today is incompatible with the other

389
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,109
requirement that you had for not telling

390
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:44,840
some big company whenever you log in

391
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,549
somewhere do you think at the moment you

392
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,989
can't have both of those things

393
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:51,419
so the question is persona

394
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,950
basically acted as a single sign-on

395
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,609
solution you could log in to persona

396
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:00,089
once and then I looked into a number of

397
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:03,109
other websites and if I think that

398
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,779
approach does not work right now without

399
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,289
telling with that concern of privacy

400
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,190
against those big companies I think with

401
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,659
the current protocols it doesn't work

402
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,039
because you're telling them the earth to

403
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,079
protocol and open IP connect protocol

404
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,289
require you to send a request on every

405
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:32,070
login so you basically have this central

406
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,200
as knowledge of where you log in anytime

407
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,489
there's a potential that we find a

408
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,769
protocol where that that's not the case

409
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,899
with the current protocols we're not

410
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,539
there and so if you don't want that you

411
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,399
probably need to look at something on

412
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,889
your own site unfortunately I already

413
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:53,070
have some of some ideas or the protocol

414
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,039
that that persona used had some some

415
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,099
chance to not tell someone every time

416
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:04,379
you log in but unfortunately it didn't

417
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,089
get enough usage thank you time for

418
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,539
questions please give a big round of

419
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,658
thank you

420
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,510
you
