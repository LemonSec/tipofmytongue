1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,580
hello my name is Alexandra stefanov and

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,120
I am a senior software developer at

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,040
alert orzo probably you know this

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,500
company by technology openvz well well

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,680
we must know or just like an open visi

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,480
well and Berto so it is our commercial

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:37,760
product well let's start well at first

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,699
we need to get to it about the confusion

9
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,070
what is containers usually people think

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,480
that's containers it's something about

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,570
docker but in fact container the

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,350
container in virtualization world lives

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,199
much longer than the doctor exists and

14
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,800
traditionally it use it for electricity

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,510
virtualization a lightweight it's if we

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,780
compare it with virtualization trust the

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,520
hypervisor when we when you create when

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,560
you when you create a heavy weirdo

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,340
machine heavy heavy it's when machinima

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,100
weights and CPU RAM PCI and other stuff

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,800
well in contrast a container

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,950
fertilization is almost a virtual

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,800
machine which runs on the same kernel

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,120
for example if you run Linux then you're

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,320
able to run Linux containers and Kent

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,980
and can't run something else like

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,540
salaries for example are BSD well

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,479
containers exist not only in Linux world

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,930
but of question BSD and Solaris and

30
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,989
probably other don't know what's going

31
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,960
on in Markus

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,540
they invent own bicycle well as this

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,110
technology consumes much less resources

34
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,770
than heavy keeper heavy VMS we argue

35
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:41,080
Perry sir and often this like wireless

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,350
web web hosting providers because they

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,580
want to run a lot of lightly containers

38
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,650
then run less less amount of virtual

39
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,610
machines and they trying to reduce their

40
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,090
costs

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,340
well this technology exists about 15 15

42
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,120
years yes

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,770
and of course it's Alexi docker and our

44
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,620
project your toes and opens our open

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,150
source project up and open dizzy

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,650
well I first need to say why docker

47
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,490
became so popular it's because it's easy

48
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,980
way to run user applications for example

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,290
if you know when you when you need to

50
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,190
run database for example it unit it run

51
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,850
a database you just like to isolate it

52
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,330
in one single and simple container and

53
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,710
if 15 years ago the launch of the

54
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,750
operating system with an other operating

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,120
system it was Wow but nowadays it's not

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,570
so well and I wanna I wanna I can say

57
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,930
that is pretty far from Wow because I

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,560
people and users are lazy again they

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,100
don't want to install

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,400
don't want to download and I saw install

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,170
it then update of course Easter is our

62
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,870
date it's often don't end users don't

63
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,920
want to install it well and it's a

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,100
reason because doctor and containers so

65
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,520
popular

66
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,320
yes

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:05,490
users need software well how to deliver

68
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,080
how to deliver a software today contato

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,790
to container there is much ways of voice

70
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:22,750
different well it's too much waste in

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,610
the ways are different and I'm trying to

72
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,890
see how to receive it

73
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,880
wait a moment

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,350
well how people how users can can

75
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,420
achieve various pre-created VMs I am

76
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,940
talking about templates templates for

77
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,960
example if you want distro punto with a

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,020
visa a patch or visas radius database

79
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,980
service are something else here is

80
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,400
of several ways to deploy it first we

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,810
can recreate a bunch of VMs even I can

82
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,560
say that this zoo zoo of VMs for example

83
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,390
via this patch VM with peach pvm visa

84
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,660
Roby and the other what's wrong here you

85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,360
need to support and maintain a lot of

86
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,730
containers you need to pull security

87
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,480
fixes you need updated you need to

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,010
maintain it you need support it and when

89
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,150
is too much container Vista place it's

90
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,640
it's just the hell well and sort wait

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,490
it's automatic creation after automatic

92
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,470
instead of the create a container

93
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,820
creation this way we using convert or

94
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:27,360
zone and for example if you want to

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,669
create an Alexi container in Ubuntu with

96
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,440
Santos it's hard because you need to

97
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,400
find a way to bootstrap it if you if you

98
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,690
run a bundle you need to install him but

99
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,960
Jung has a lot of Python dependencies

100
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,750
probably probably oven with dependencies

101
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,640
like it like it's like if it is like

102
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,860
instant O's it's difficult just trust me

103
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,950
it's very difficult to create machine

104
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,400
and the

105
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,870
usually in alexi people prepare the own

106
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,150
load pre-created pre created templates

107
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,919
as I said as I said on a previous slide

108
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:32,099
it's not a good way well in general put

109
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,120
to Linux in the container possible meant

110
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,919
in many ways the question is how to life

111
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,039
after install I say as I said need to

112
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,490
support it and still updates and do

113
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:55,310
other stuff in vert also we organize it

114
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,579
such an approach it is basic and in the

115
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,800
first place on the facts that we have

116
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,180
for our own set of tools set of tools

117
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,920
and a gator ganas system and we don't

118
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,440
need to reinvent somewhere two ways to

119
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,250
install and execute scripts oh yes and

120
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,890
of course you must know how a Linux

121
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,750
distro marks because of when you

122
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,360
unpacking and packing clinics in

123
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,390
container you need to execute various

124
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,660
prayer or post predella pre delete

125
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,540
scripts and other stuff it's usually

126
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,449
squared because of every every package

127
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:57,300
manager has own hex hex in rpm squids

128
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,850
and from time to time it's looks like a

129
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,240
hell

130
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:14,229
well what is what is container container

131
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:17,289
delivering its when you unpacking

132
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,749
specially prepared with our heaves

133
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:24,129
usually you know with like depths are

134
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,299
rpm well what it is what it is for

135
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,259
example what is RPM package it is CP i--

136
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,829
or heave that contains special special

137
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,220
formatted metadata this build time with

138
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:47,189
scripts with triggers and most important

139
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:51,539
thing most most important thing is

140
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,169
requires for example package bash

141
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:02,910
requires a rip lip read line well and

142
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,100
most difficult most difficult here it's

143
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,409
to unpack unpack container in the right

144
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,679
order

145
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,839
well five mins left I am trying to hurry

146
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,070
up well in general was installation its

147
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,800
rpm yep our hip and packaging in the

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,310
correct sequence and of course with

149
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,310
executing scripts and triggers the end

150
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,550
and packing it at right order

151
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:51,220
package for acquire slippery bar and in

152
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,620
additional special package manager

153
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,069
nuances like what hard-coded in rpm

154
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,889
mercy files

155
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:06,370
scriptlets and cetera what we do in the

156
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,389
dirt also well we have a special tools

157
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:17,920
that we call VG PG its dual right and C

158
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
and part of this tool is Raptor for

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,170
specially prepared and modified package

160
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,319
measure for virus we know the distress

161
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:34,260
for example it's denia fumes if ur and

162
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:43,690
etc and you don't need to pull specialty

163
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,959
created VMs from web hosting it's all

164
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,060
the stuff you can create on organ a

165
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,560
machine and you don't need worry to

166
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,100
worry about

167
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,860
what's running what what's running here

168
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,699
there towards the Linux you just can

169
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,339
create Ubuntu template with absolutely

170
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,870
default tools with zpg well what we what

171
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,800
to have kinds of templates we separate

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,069
it to two kinds it's Austin plates and

173
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,110
the app to place for example Austin

174
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,500
place its basic basic four one two it's

175
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,880
a minimal system our basic forward

176
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,870
does its Bosch and minimum set of tools

177
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,160
like Bosch young and probably probably

178
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,740
several several others ensue mitts about

179
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,590
100 packages not so much

180
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,320
well and second it's it's an empty place

181
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,150
like HP a posh my secure radius and it's

182
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:05,110
cetera well well how to use it it's

183
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,320
sounds and looks very easy physically

184
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,940
I'll create a number of your container

185
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,450
in fact it's it's just named Austin

186
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,960
plate and you need to put here what you

187
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,560
want

188
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,040
in my example it's so just to bunt oh

189
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,700
well second second client it's it's an

190
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,070
optimal eight well and start it's

191
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,470
example of removing well sounds very

192
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,250
useful and fast that's all guys thank

193
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,470
you

194
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,899
[Applause]

195
00:14:53,899 --> 00:15:04,350
Alexander anybody any questions so is

196
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,809
the result actually a different type of

197
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,279
container than a docker template or

198
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,319
docker container what what is the

199
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:11,790
resulting container something different

200
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,089
than a docker container yes it's a

201
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:20,189
daughter it's about it's based on the

202
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:22,769
same principles but doctor it's for

203
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:25,110
installations application for is for

204
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,029
application installation when you need

205
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,480
to run just database just a simple

206
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,970
database you can run daughter and you

207
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,179
can run docker inside openvz container

208
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,899
just for other purposes

209
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,050
as I said this technology prefer web

210
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,839
hosting providers because they need to

211
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,059
run very much containers on on the

212
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,179
Carver's and run less amount of virtual

213
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,369
machines just an open visi it's form

214
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,990
like a small vertel machine it's not

215
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,660
about is not about application

216
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:13,860
installation so one last question the

217
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,100
end of year how do you manage

218
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,160
repositories the repository lists I mean

219
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
different versions for the same

220
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,490
repositories for distres it's just a

221
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,920
standard repositories we don't don't

222
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,170
invent bicycles here just you standard

223
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,969
what distro suggests

224
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,060
could people try and leave if they want

225
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,950
to fry that side that's where people

226
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,960
coming in can move from that side please

227
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,220
because otherwise it's going to be

228
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,630
really busy so any more questions all

229
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,750
right this is a little thank-you time we

230
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,740
have thank you all

231
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:04,079
[Applause]
