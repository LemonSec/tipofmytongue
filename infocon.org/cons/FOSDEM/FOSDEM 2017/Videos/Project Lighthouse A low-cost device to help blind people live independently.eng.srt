1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,269
oh my name is David I was working on a

2
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,750
project called project lighthouse which

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,939
I usually plan to introduce to you today

4
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,369
things were a bit complicated there are

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,759
a few interesting plot twists between

6
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,700
the time I submitted this talk than the

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,590
time I finished the slides than the time

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,260
of when I'm presenting but so let's

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,629
start with the plot twist the prototype

10
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,270
has broken at some point so I'm not

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,840
going to make a demo of this but

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
so what's project lighthouse project

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
lighthouse was a project of Mozilla's

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,770
connected devices branch dedicated to

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,380
helping blind people live in their daily

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,100
life this talk at some point I

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,809
considered renaming it how not to die

18
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,880
when you're preparing a hardware

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,090
prototype which is pretty ironic given

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,950
that connected devices died two days ago

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,869
so I'm still going to present

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:28,530
so about us we devices was a set of

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,080
internal nonprofit startups inside

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,009
Mozilla the idea when it worked was to

25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,210
have great ideas make great prototypes

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,310
try to convince people to give us money

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,409
to turn the prototypes into actual

28
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,229
products and hopefully to make products

29
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,869
that will help users connected devices

30
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,759
has produced a total of zero products

31
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,100
which might be somewhat related to the

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,400
fact that we don't exist anymore

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,230
[Laughter]

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,170
at some point and since we were the

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,909
rebels we were still using the Dyne user

36
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,050
and not the new funky weird logo of

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,840
Mozilla this might be the last time you

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:22,920
see the diners are tell you what this is

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,910
about I mean what project light house is

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,340
about because initially project light

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,730
house was about we know how to use

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,280
cameras we know how to program this kind

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,470
of thing can't we do something not

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,010
creepy because if you look at the use of

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,200
cameras in connected devices in IOT

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,480
these days just about everything is

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,640
about watching you do something and

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,310
telling someone on the cloud exactly

49
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,320
what you're doing which is incidentally

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,660
one of the reasons while company why

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,180
some many big companies are interested

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,180
in this for strategic reasons for

53
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,180
insurances and I mean there are many

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,320
companies that have interested in

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,000
knowing what you're doing at home either

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,340
to sell you things or to charge you for

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,650
things you're doing and that's one of

58
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,420
the reasons why there is so much focus

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,940
and so much money involved and invested

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,790
in Internet of Things these days it's

61
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,739
not just because it's fun it's also

62
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,720
because being creepy is profitable

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,200
but we wanted to do something not creepy

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,900
so what can we do with the camera a

65
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,570
Raspberry Pi and a microphone and a

66
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,940
speaker that happened to draw more juice

67
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,590
than the element ation of the Raspberry

68
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,340
Pi can provide which is pretty much why

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,540
I cannot do the demo today do something

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,270
useful so sometimes the solution meets

71
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,060
the problem because there turn out to be

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,670
some people who have interest in having

73
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,250
a camera and something interesting done

74
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,700
with the camera some people the life can

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,190
be changed with camera so according to

76
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,720
the World Health Organization there were

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,100
close to 300 million users sorry people

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,990
who live with a sight impairment about

79
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,070
30 million of them or entirely blind but

80
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,260
still that's many people who have

81
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,350
trouble in everyday life recognizing

82
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,910
objects for instance this means that in

83
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,220
shops these people have lots of trouble

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,380
they need help to find out exactly what

85
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,770
they're buying and since shops tend to

86
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,190
at least in big shops tend to change the

87
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,930
place of things regularly to force

88
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,560
people to revisit everything if your

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,840
sight visually impaired you're in

90
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,880
trouble because they are actively

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,850
working against you against all your

92
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,410
brain or muscle memory

93
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,740
they are trying to force you to not know

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,040
where you are anymore

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,860
there are basically basically the

96
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,310
solution is find help so there are a few

97
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,830
devices that I know of essentially two

98
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,000
specialized devices to help people in

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,110
this kind of situation

100
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,060
they both are pretty much more than

101
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,780
$2,000 for something that actually

102
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,960
contains this kind of hardware so the

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,389
idea is

104
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,599
I mean that's worth about $30 maybe 40 I

105
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,280
don't remember but that's the battery so

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,830
the idea is can we do something open

107
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,150
source open the hardware and chip and we

108
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,699
set out to try that so more specifically

109
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,349
we wanted to help visually impaired

110
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,349
people recognize household eat items

111
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:56,319
because if you have two packs of the

112
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,080
same size it's pretty hard to know well

113
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,449
if you have two cans one is coke and one

114
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,620
is Fanta you have no way of knowing

115
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,919
which one is which if you don't see them

116
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,449
but in that case is pretty easy for

117
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,360
camera to make the difference

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,569
other things are much harder but we try

119
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,090
to see if we could do that so we

120
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,860
actually got good results with the for

121
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,539
the one above and pretty bad results

122
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,580
with the one below but we only had a few

123
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:39,789
weeks of development so so we get little

124
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:43,629
software to developers oh sorry yeah

125
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,289
lots of open CV - so - developers

126
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,719
working for a few weeks time and we

127
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:56,610
actually managed to users

128
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,920
so I have pictures of actual users but

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm pretty sure that I do not have the

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,840
right to put them in an image so I used

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,730
super villains instead so we have 24

132
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,220
test users so we actually tested

133
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,150
something that was a slightly more

134
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,110
refined version of this

135
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,610
this was prototype number one there is a

136
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,670
prototype number two that still is

137
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,920
somewhere in California and probably

138
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,770
going to stay there so I could not show

139
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,450
you it would have been a bit easier to

140
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,720
make the demo because it does not rely

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,220
on so many outside stuff

142
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,669
and so I call this presentation lessons

143
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,699
learned so lesson number one nerd if it

144
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,349
hasn't been tested by users it doesn't

145
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,869
work it just because it's cool just

146
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,419
because it has code just because we had

147
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,330
fun developing it doesn't mean that it

148
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,229
works so we were lucky after relatively

149
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,149
few either eight iterations we got

150
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:04,019
something nice so that was prototype to

151
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:14,050
our lessons were yes not all of these 24

152
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,029
users who are interested but enough of

153
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,800
them were interested that it was worth

154
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,899
doing they thought it would change their

155
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,779
life not everything in their life but at

156
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,479
least shopping which is an important

157
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,919
part of life if you need to you know eat

158
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,559
so we're supposed to work on making on

159
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,458
keeping it cheap making it simpler and

160
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,630
have a better form factor

161
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,320
cookie so that was making a prototype

162
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,090
how do we get from deer there to a

163
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,390
product

164
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,699
so we put some designer to design some

165
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,329
stuff we put a factory and that's pretty

166
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:05,529
much not it not how it works it's a bit

167
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,110
more complicated so for the documents

168
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,839
and on a blog that details a little bit

169
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,139
more the process from the time you get

170
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,980
the hardware prototype and a good

171
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,260
industrial design to the time you can

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,180
actually ship it so forget marketing on

173
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,660
the top

174
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,399
forget the app development at the top

175
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,160
you still get all these three four lines

176
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,910
and our estimates were that they could

177
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,699
take about six month time to get done

178
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,360
could actually be worse when I wrote

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,980
this slides I was preparing to tell you

180
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,570
that it's probably going to take more

181
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,470
than six months in fact it going to take

182
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,190
forever so I was right so the question

183
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,569
here is

184
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,649
what do you do

185
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,019
are you going to sit down during six

186
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,249
months and do nothing how can you not

187
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:12,050
waste your time so again this lectures

188
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,749
lecture sorry this presentation is about

189
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:19,220
lessons learned so we actually came up

190
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,029
with a solution and it's actually simple

191
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:29,089
one you are building a device you want

192
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,240
to test it so test things if possible

193
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,809
with devices that people already have

194
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,309
most people these days have a smartphone

195
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:42,350
or tablet some have a small TV so if you

196
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,929
can find a device that your users

197
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:49,189
already have you can paralyze things you

198
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,129
can have someone possibly you working on

199
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,379
the hardware finalizing the hardware

200
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,339
getting the providers getting the supply

201
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,829
chain getting everything together

202
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,920
testing actual hardware components etc

203
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,040
etc something that's going to take you

204
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,980
insane amount amount of efforts and time

205
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,439
and you can also work on the software at

206
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,319
the same time which is the things that

207
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:20,040
some of us do best yes

208
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,449
so in this case we set out to use a

209
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:30,370
device that blind users have and this

210
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,269
device is called an iPhone it turns out

211
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,019
that a huge number of we actually have

212
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,389
no numbers of blind users not visually

213
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,189
impaired users but for blind users it

214
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:44,550
turns out that many of them have iPhones

215
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,519
in the US it's like 85% of those who

216
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,230
have a smartphone have an iPhone and

217
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,639
many of them have a smartphone I don't

218
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,100
remember the exact numbers so this means

219
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,639
that we got ourselves working on a third

220
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:05,559
prototype that was that we all fold them

221
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,499
we are in open-source stuff if you want

222
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:14,160
to develop for open-source for this

223
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,189
let's just say that I have seen many

224
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,949
platforms on which developing open

225
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,740
source software is nice simple easy

226
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,709
stuff works this is not one of them

227
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,500
Apple is going to extreme lengths to

228
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,850
make sure that everything is locked down

229
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,689
and you have to go through them for

230
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,579
everything so part of the lessons

231
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,949
learned yes you need to go where your

232
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,519
users are for testing if you can avoid

233
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,220
that platform it's worth trying

234
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,149
so

235
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,420
we actually only got three weeks of work

236
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,570
on that so most 35 weeks most of the

237
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,100
time for me was spent actually getting

238
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,150
Xcode to work getting unit testing to

239
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,570
work and trying to actually release

240
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,480
binaries we have not succeeded at that

241
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,500
yet everything is locked down really

242
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:26,660
tight so it would be a great time to

243
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,790
discuss the next steps what have we done

244
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,820
we have an early prototype of that I

245
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,760
could actually do a move that let's see

246
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,010
if it works so

247
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,049
[Music]

248
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:57,810
you don't hear anything do you bunch of

249
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,770
people behind the camera

250
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:12,600
oh gosh completely so it was trying to

251
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,860
find out which was the interesting

252
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,110
object in the scene and apparently the

253
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:30,639
interesting because also the microphone

254
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:42,190
is dying so let's pretend that I have a

255
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:48,430
very nice demo what should the next

256
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,579
steps be okay fair enough make the demo

257
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,620
work that would be a pretty good next

258
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,240
step

259
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,069
what should the other next steps me at

260
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:00,970
that stage at that stage assuming that

261
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,759
we have software that works nicely

262
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,709
assuming that we are still on track to

263
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,589
get hardware oh I'm actually we do have

264
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,230
many nice hardware designs I did not

265
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,120
include them in the slides because I

266
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,100
think they involve commercial partners

267
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,500
so that we probably do not have the

268
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,260
right to put them here it doesn't matter

269
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,430
anymore but hey so at this stage our

270
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,850
next steps would be ok so make it work

271
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,010
for real the prototype apparently

272
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,430
doesn't work at for them so opening

273
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,170
issue doesn't work at for them so we

274
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,720
have been working so far on making some

275
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,540
basic computer vision algorithms

276
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,040
obviously making better computer vision

277
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,180
algorithms would be helpful

278
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,690
but in uniting is once since we have the

279
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,000
ability to prototype on the this ugly

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,480
stuff we can iterate and paralyze so

281
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,090
people working on improving the computer

282
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,730
vision people working with actual users

283
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,950
on improving the usability and the

284
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,100
accessibility people working with users

285
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,590
not necessarily the same ones on coming

286
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,950
up with new features we were also

287
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,600
planning to go further because at this

288
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,220
stage this is an IOT session I was

289
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,180
talking about tea but there was no I

290
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,260
there is no I in team so one of our

291
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,370
plans was to make it social not in the

292
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,160
bad way let's add Facebook everywhere

293
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,140
but in the good way as in sometimes

294
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,940
people need more help than just

295
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,320
identifying something easy to identify

296
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,520
sometimes people need help to find oh

297
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,900
gosh I'm wounded does it look bad one of

298
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,780
my breasts feels large you know sick I

299
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,840
mean that's a pretty good one and that's

300
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,280
the kind of reasons for which you need

301
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,069
more help than just what the Machine can

302
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,170
help so we wanted to help people share

303
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,220
their questions with people they trusts

304
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,839
and possibly in cases that were more

305
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,240
much boarder share questions with just

306
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,520
about any volunteer so we were in

307
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,560
parallel starting to work on a platform

308
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,470
for crowdsourcing questions from people

309
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,770
with sight impairments such as what is

310
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:37,340
that object what am I doing here going

311
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,930
to be released ever because there is no

312
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:52,700
single line of code written yet as I

313
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,130
said if you don't want to die to avoid

314
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,650
multiplying devices real devices but you

315
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,190
can again fake stuff using existing

316
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,730
devices once you have software running I

317
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,610
mean one of our industrial designs for

318
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,750
instance was actually a necklace

319
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,700
relatively heavy necklace containing

320
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:26,510
well basically this and that's something

321
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,150
that we can fake easily if we have

322
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,240
software we can easily make prototypes

323
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,940
that don't have to go through a factory

324
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,550
flat you can pick a real necklace or

325
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,670
anything that fits around your neck try

326
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,670
it and attach stuff that's not

327
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,070
sufficient for commercialization but

328
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,780
that's more than sufficient to find out

329
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,610
whether it's too heavy for users or

330
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,070
whether users actually manage to point

331
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,130
the camera in the right place because we

332
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,010
actually got tests and just actually say

333
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,570
that when people point cameras very well

334
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,340
that's that was a very good surprise

335
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,800
they have difficulties judging the

336
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,810
distance so it's sometimes it's too

337
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,350
close but it's Center and that's good

338
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,750
because that's something that needed to

339
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,200
be tested anyway if you want to avoid

340
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,440
relying on having a finished hardware

341
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,650
device before you can iterate and one of

342
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,280
the ways to do it is to have fake device

343
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,050
so just something rigged together using

344
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,340
a device for which you already have

345
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,790
software

346
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,120
so one thing you do not need to forget

347
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,850
if you are working and if you want to

348
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,730
somehow release a hardware device is

349
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,900
that it does not stop there you probably

350
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,230
have lots of legal things to cover that

351
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,000
we are not used to in the open source

352
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,100
world in this case people could possibly

353
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,930
have accidents because of this physical

354
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,600
accidents people trying to use it to

355
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,690
identify 25 medications for instance

356
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,460
could end up with the wrong medication

357
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,010
or they could add a period with rat

358
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,130
poison eating rat poison because we had

359
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,760
told us that it was beans red beans

360
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,940
something like that that's pretty tricky

361
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,680
so we of course we want to make sure

362
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,940
that the software works but many of

363
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,230
these things are have real-life

364
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,110
implications which among other things

365
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:42,590
involve lawyers in this case we also you

366
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,960
should also have been in touch with a

367
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
number of people such as organizations

368
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,300
helping blind and sight impaired people

369
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,250
because that was the best way to get in

370
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,480
touch with our users one thing that's

371
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,990
often overlooked is the Kickstarter

372
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,630
Kickstarter people generally see it as a

373
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,970
way to raise money

374
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,790
the secret of Kickstarter is that this

375
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,390
is not true Kickstarter is actually a

376
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,600
marketing tool used by companies to

377
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
measure interest in a product before

378
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,610
they develop it if people are willing to

379
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,800
invest ten thousand dollars of ten

380
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,940
million dollars that depends on the

381
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,770
product and this means that you can sell

382
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,700
the product I know of a number of cases

383
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,990
in which Kickstarter has been used to

384
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,150
sell a product that had no kind of any

385
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,940
kind of existence in the real world just

386
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,100
to measure whether it was the world is

387
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,060
worth worth it was worth trying to build

388
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,680
such a product some of our potential

389
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,350
partners did that for instance and we

390
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,720
had surprises so again if you're trying

391
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,750
to build something and turn it from

392
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,980
hobby to something that you can

393
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,600
distribute Kickstarter is a pretty good

394
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,100
tool for that not just for raising money

395
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:22,790
before to check if it's worth doing you

396
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,950
can find all these software prototypes

397
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,970
of project lighthouse on github and we

398
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,720
have a discourse forum if you want to I

399
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,440
don't know sympathize with us thank you

400
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,010
very much for listening

401
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,539
and if you have questions I will be

402
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:59,669
happy to try an answer yes so what's

403
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,350
going to happen with the prototypes of

404
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,330
lighthouse will they be released so the

405
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,830
software prototypes are on github

406
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,929
already I mean we need to put a license

407
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,580
because we just forgot that in the rush

408
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,899
but on github the hardware design

409
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,450
prototypes I don't know I would like us

410
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,340
to release them I do not know if they

411
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,710
belong entirely to us if they belong

412
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,999
entirely to us I think we can release

413
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,100
them if they don't we probably can't

414
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
yes

415
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,740
yes

416
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,550
so the question is if so many blind

417
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,590
people and vision-impaired people have

418
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,440
smartphones why not just make an app we

419
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,630
also considered that yes that was a

420
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,930
separate track I am I'm an IOT session

421
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,850
so I was concentrating on the IOT stuff

422
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,750
but yes we considered continuing the app

423
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,580
track past the prototype phase

424
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,100
okay great thank you very much
