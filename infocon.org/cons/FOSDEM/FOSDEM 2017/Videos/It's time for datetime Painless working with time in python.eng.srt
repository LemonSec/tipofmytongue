1
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,789
hello everyone well first I want to be

2
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,560
sure when he said free beers it's not

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,180
within this room I see a lot of people

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,150
here just to be clear there's no beer

5
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,770
here now you should probably go out for

6
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,000
it well so my name is Mark Victor I work

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,340
at the lumber and I'm here today I'm

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,690
working in new sublimation and I went

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,700
through a lot of pain one working with

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,739
time-sensitive applications in Python

11
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,840
and I just want to share my experience

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,780
so either fall into the same pitfall the

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,550
main takeaway I want you to take here is

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,680
if you are doing anything that it's

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,719
really time-sensitive you'll see there

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,190
are a lot of problems that can arise so

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,329
you really want to check and validate

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,209
assumptions so yeah so the first of all

19
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,340
something I've really liked and I want

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,990
to share is this is not just about

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,789
Python this is about day time in general

22
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,830
had this this moment which is like the

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,350
Pluto caper you see the real world and

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,720
you see how complex day time is so the

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,849
things like we give we gave measuring

26
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,640
the time for granted but if you think

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,170
about is the same problem as measuring

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,020
distance we can just use the meter to to

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,700
measure the things but if you wouldn't

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
have that how how would you be able to

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,690
measure other things so for time is

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,509
especially complicated because for me

33
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,890
too you can have something physical that

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,259
can measure it but for time you need you

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,890
just need to a constant and recurring

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,830
event with as constant as possible with

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,899
a frequency as one that has as constant

38
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,090
as possible so what I mean is if you for

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,550
example want it you can just measure the

40
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,440
duration of the day or any other thing

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,929
based on how long it takes to fill a

42
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,929
bucket of with water if you're able to

43
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:06,060
feel the bucket in constant time so you

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,538
can say a day takes 100 times 2 to 100

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,510
buckets to be filled right and lucky

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,250
enough we can use buckets of water we

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,510
use the second

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,189
and I want to speak about sometimes

49
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,200
standards that look the one that are we

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,930
are still using the first talk the first

51
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,099
of all is you t1 u t1 is message the

52
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,530
second as a fraction of the day today in

53
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,150
the sense of the time it takes for the

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,379
earth to do a full spin and this is this

55
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,379
is great it's great for civil times and

56
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,680
now before it was just being based on

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,489
you know when we see the unlike the

58
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,290
solar time so whenever you see that

59
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,720
there has full comparing to the Sun NOAA

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,819
days we are using position of stars and

61
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,370
more complex things as a curiosity if

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,079
you ever wonder why do we have 24 hours

63
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,859
is because gibson's were had a system

64
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,720
based on 12 not a decimal one because of

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,549
the joints in the finger you can read

66
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,470
more about that's really cool so then we

67
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,879
looking for this recurring event like

68
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,150
with constant as possible frequency we

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,489
realize that make microwave in session

70
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,280
cell session makes it elextra oscillate

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,319
at the very nearly constant frequency

72
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,959
yet I read it I couldn't memorize that

73
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,049
sentence and so we started to build

74
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,030
atomic plots we charges using session

75
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,590
and this is great this is what's being

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,230
used for astronomical times this is what

77
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,739
theis understands for us like into

78
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,480
international astronomical time it's

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,910
really really precise and and it's

80
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,060
actually so precise that the civil time

81
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,730
in the earth will deviate from it which

82
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,280
is clearly an issue and to see how

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,980
complex 62 computed of all those many

84
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,739
laughs are are the moment gauging in

85
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,530
getting this really precise time like

86
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,409
time and measure of the second but then

87
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,190
UTC came UTC is what you all want years

88
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,260
it's this is the savior it comes with a

89
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,030
lot of problems as well but that's what

90
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,819
everyone's using now so this is a

91
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,699
standard that meshes their time the same

92
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,519
way that tied us so it's it's based on

93
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,029
session clocks and but so it doesn't

94
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,940
deviate what it does it's it says it it

95
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,159
has support to either leap second every

96
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,440
so often we just have one in December

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,390
if you felt it your life was a second

98
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,850
longer and so just just by doing that

99
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,370
you can measure the time with a really

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,820
precise instrument and you can keep noon

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,710
being the time where the Sun is in the

102
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,570
sky and it's like in the top of this guy

103
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,670
but just that in the leap second this

104
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,680
comes with a lot of problem for us for

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,300
us so was developers because now's

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,350
minutes can have up to 60 to 61 seconds

107
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,170
well it we'll see more about that so UTC

108
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,940
came as well with the time so with their

109
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,610
concept of time zones and UTC offset so

110
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,940
our UTC offset is just an amount of time

111
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,300
you will subtract or add from UTC to get

112
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,920
your time so the things like whenever

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,470
you speak the problem is you never speak

114
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,050
on the time own on the UTC right if

115
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,730
you're in New York you have your five

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,250
hours yeah - five hours know my password

117
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,690
you can check that is the idea is you

118
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,940
want 12 o'clock to be the time the Sun

119
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,340
is in the sky so you will be use time

120
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,280
zones sorry okay UTC offset and then

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,440
there is the concept of time zones which

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,870
is there are as many as you see here and

123
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,550
there are all kind of weird time zones

124
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,490
like some countries been hours and a

125
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,010
quarter and hours and 45 minutes and all

126
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,050
kind of crazy thing that's come from

127
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,510
political issues as in my country wants

128
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,250
to be in this time earlier than yours

129
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,640
and you just don't want to deal with it

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,050
you just want to use an open source

131
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,490
library that will do it for you and just

132
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,340
forget about it but a time zone is just

133
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,640
a region that where everyone in there

134
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,870
follows the same standard time I know

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,360
this lips already complex with well we

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
will get into what kind of you should

137
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,620
have come and then the last comes that I

138
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,450
wanted in trees before going into some

139
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,660
code is time stands virtual versus wall

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,070
time so there are two kind of times

141
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,720
times time is just an absolute point in

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,630
like the absolute line of time whilst

143
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,730
the whole time so for example the time

144
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,580
star will have been born or the time a

145
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,680
log was put into a file something

146
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,990
while small-time is more like I'll meet

147
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,919
you in two weeks

148
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,949
two o'clock it's just a day at a time in

149
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,680
a specific location and those just

150
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,210
follow kind of totally different rules

151
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,389
to be more interesting of course so

152
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,820
first of all which is fine I'm gonna

153
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,759
give some facts on tips from the

154
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,720
experience I had

155
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,900
so fact a time with as an upset cannot

156
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,860
be mapped into a time stamp so if in

157
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,500
Python you have a daytime library which

158
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,590
is part of the standard is great more or

159
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,889
less but you have a method which is

160
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,020
called now you can use it to generate an

161
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,880
instance of the daytime and is just

162
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,490
returning a current time if you just

163
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,560
call it like this you just it's gonna

164
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,270
just give you a day time without any

165
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,900
kind of timezone and that you know where

166
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,789
is the day words that date on time you

167
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,009
have no clue right that's it's I want

168
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,389
the other one say it's ambiguous because

169
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,940
ambiguous I saw that notation on dying

170
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,180
day time but it's like it's implicit the

171
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,860
time since you cannot get an absolute

172
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,740
point of time out of this those times

173
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,570
are referring Python that's naive day

174
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,330
times and opposed to times on the world

175
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,820
day times which are the items that have

176
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,860
a time so that they have time zone

177
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,380
attached to it and Python something I

178
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,270
love from Python API is you cannot mix

179
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,620
them so if you compare them you'll get

180
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,159
an inscription so the tip is just set

181
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,650
the offset whenever said the said the

182
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,570
offset that so you get at times in the

183
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,120
world data when you call now whenever

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,460
you create the day time just remember to

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,720
pass the time zone if you want an

186
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,909
absolute point of town time and this

187
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,820
will give you again the same date but

188
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,250
with the time zone on it and it will

189
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,720
respect the time some value person

190
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,070
because of the previous one it was

191
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,330
giving you like the time the time

192
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,409
depending on whatever time zone your

193
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,029
machine is configured which I'm so you

194
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,289
don't want because you don't probably

195
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,578
even know where your time to where your

196
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:42,849
machine is right and yeah so then when

197
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,010
you see all this okay I'll just you know

198
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,020
pass the time soon and that's hill then

199
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,950
DST Kames

200
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,670
this is this great idea we had to save

201
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,400
electricity many years ago which is we

202
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,329
will just

203
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,489
move our clocks forward in sprint and

204
00:08:57,489 --> 00:09:01,480
move them back in autumn with Atia of it

205
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,670
will look like the Sun rises later but

206
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,189
as well the sunset is later as well so

207
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,170
this world safe it was this was safe

208
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,879
light because people will be more time

209
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,339
awake on when there is light inside

210
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,119
right and this might have being great at

211
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,819
the time but at the moment they its it

212
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,799
has been slow so everyone agrees that

213
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,809
whether it's saving or actually costing

214
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,110
money is only a 1% of the total money

215
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,879
and it comes with all kind of hassles

216
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,759
like you know all kind of problems in

217
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,470
software development because you have to

218
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,689
deal with this craziness of one location

219
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:38,829
having two different offsets and as an

220
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,579
interesting thing because because people

221
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,799
will have less sleep the day the moves

222
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,709
the clocks are moved the the Monday

223
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,529
after the DST change is that is the day

224
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,769
with the highest peak of suicide so why

225
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,299
are we still doing this right some

226
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,999
countries are moving out of it well so

227
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:02,529
far more than what you can see here we

228
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,809
can get the timezone using the PI to set

229
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,749
model and you can you can get the

230
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,239
timezone in Europe Brussels this is

231
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,040
using the Olson database which is

232
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,540
available with PI to set it was the

233
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,850
recommended library until 3.6 from

234
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,929
different sig you should be using

235
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,769
dedicated and here you can see we passed

236
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,790
a date in winter and the the offset is

237
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,919
+1 this is Central European Time and

238
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,410
this is Standard Time

239
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,439
well if you take the day which is in

240
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,089
summer if this is Central European

241
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,009
summer time they all say this plus T and

242
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,480
and you get daylight saving time this

243
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,669
like you know if you think about all the

244
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,290
problems that can come from he if you're

245
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,209
working with with with time zones that

246
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,709
have DST

247
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,459
it's incredible so my tip is just to use

248
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,559
them just use UTC whenever you can just

249
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,100
use UTC and you'll be fine really but if

250
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
you have to use

251
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,679
time zones because your clients are

252
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,360
using time zones so if you want to do

253
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,040
that I would I would suggest you that

254
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,809
you save as well the time zone and use

255
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,129
this convert on the borders it's like

256
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,439
Unicode you do this única language so

257
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,170
you would do I would do the same with

258
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,749
with the tensions you can use both PI to

259
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:19,779
set or they do till this is like this

260
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,480
you just call whenever you get whenever

261
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,329
you get a daytime with UTC all

262
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,429
commercials out to save from that one if

263
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,319
you create the date with other ones it's

264
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,610
not that just use UTC so whenever you

265
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,230
have a date an absolute point of time

266
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,029
already you can call it as time zone and

267
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,769
pass attention which you can get both

268
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,069
with date you to or respite to set and

269
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,019
this is a safe conversion and you will

270
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,860
get a day time for whatever times and

271
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,040
then you you asked us next

272
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,869
you cannot map a future world time to

273
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:55,990
attempts them it was like come on like

274
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,300
we already saw time since if I have a

275
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,709
date and a time zone

276
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,350
why can I like why don't I get an

277
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,850
absolute point of time right if I tell

278
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,230
you meet you next Friday at 2 o'clock in

279
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,029
Turkey that's an absolute point that's

280
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,860
an absolute point in time right well

281
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,259
it's not because countries will change

282
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,209
the time zones countries will just

283
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,579
decide to stop following DST and they

284
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,049
will actually give really short advice

285
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,240
of it last example was target just

286
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,529
decided to stop polio DST and yeah this

287
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,809
this can get really messy if you don't

288
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,689
update your time some database this is

289
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:34,899
really important tip you really need to

290
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,689
update pi T set or a date util or

291
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,970
whatever you're using because otherwise

292
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,129
it's gonna bite you back you might be

293
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,139
using a really old version of a time

294
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:44,529
somehow

295
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,660
and for some I also an interesting thing

296
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,129
there was a country that changed

297
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,389
sanctions from offset - 12 to plus 12

298
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,540
and that meant that they miss the day in

299
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,329
the year so those four people has one

300
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,819
less day well maybe they got paid the

301
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,319
same salary and work on the state

302
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,410
depends me how you see it but yes can

303
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,910
you imagine like having to work with all

304
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,429
kind of this weirdness so just use a

305
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,870
library that supports this don't write

306
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,720
your own stuff

307
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,570
so after all this painful thing you just

308
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,700
decided to send your daytime object like

309
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,560
do your beautiful absolutes point in

310
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,960
time into a day so pale oh thank guess

311
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,270
what Jason doesn't support doesn't

312
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,300
support any kind of yeah Jason Birk

313
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,780
right

314
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,830
isn't that Jason what so Jason doesn't

315
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,210
support daytime's

316
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,310
sorry that since it doesn't have any

317
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,470
kind of way to to represent those so you

318
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,170
need to serve allies then and the best

319
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,110
way to do it is use a standard right you

320
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,940
just don't want to format it however you

321
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,240
want

322
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,620
you might be thinking like come on we

323
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,430
are Europeans within that a date is day

324
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,330
month year hour minute second but turns

325
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,250
out that in the US they actually do

326
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,890
month day year I know it sounds crazy

327
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,920
but well whatever and month day year I

328
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,520
promise is true and in Japan they do

329
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,370
they do the other way where they did a

330
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,160
year month day and so just use the

331
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,630
standard there is ISO 8601 it has

332
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,010
representation on strings for all kind

333
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,190
of date and time related objects and you

334
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,660
know your isn't a standard you can rely

335
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,310
on that you can tell the people just use

336
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,280
that instead of saying you know I'd like

337
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,730
to format my dates however I want if you

338
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,650
don't like strings and you want to use

339
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,770
integers you can use you can use that an

340
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,560
epic based representation the idea is

341
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,390
you will choose a date for example for

342
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,390
you for eunuchs the the epoch for unions

343
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,150
is 90 70 and you start to come the

344
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,400
second from them so you just add one to

345
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,960
the integer from starting from that

346
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,500
point they are all kind of opposed by

347
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,610
1970 which is the most famous is just

348
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,290
for index but that's also a way to

349
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,010
sterilize an absolute point in time by

350
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,670
the way you next time this is like UTC

351
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:13,900
but ignores the leap seconds so first it

352
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,940
oh yeah fact time arithmetic can be

353
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,650
really ambiguous when you say I want to

354
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,960
add update to add a time what do you

355
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,180
mean do you mean you want the same time

356
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,520
but the next day do you want to add the

357
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,930
number of seconds on the day because

358
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,800
it's not the same

359
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
we so we have things like DST and if you

360
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,019
are here you have some days that are 23

361
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,269
hours and some days about 25 because

362
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,189
because of the DST change there is a

363
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:37,809
point on the time where the clock goes

364
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,550
back one hour and there is another point

365
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,259
of the time when the clock goes forward

366
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,220
one hour so the horrible teeth ain't

367
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,629
gonna give you is just think about it

368
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,149
like Emily they do your assumptions just

369
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,069
test whatever you are doing the image

370
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:54,209
has nothing to do with what I'm saying

371
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,399
so some faces like some tennis ball

372
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,449
doing that so just whenever you if you

373
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,549
are sensible to this kind of things like

374
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,559
DST changes because you're not using UTC

375
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,970
because you are not using the privacy I

376
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,989
gave you which you shouldn't and then be

377
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,399
be aware that if you are doing

378
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,089
arithmetic on on on day times that are

379
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,110
half time zones that follow DST you

380
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,160
might have you're gonna have issues

381
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,809
because they might not behave as as you

382
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,489
think about them and if you use impiety

383
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,980
set which is even worse when dealing

384
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,290
with that that you till fixes that if

385
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,639
you're you can practice that you need to

386
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,089
call local normalize after doing all

387
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,850
kind of arithmetic so reviewing the tips

388
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,079
be aware of the different centers of

389
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,569
time and know which one you are actually

390
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,699
thinking about but I mean it's like you

391
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,730
might be thinking on like astronomical

392
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,470
times that you might be using UTC and

393
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,480
that it's gonna leave this is gonna lead

394
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,689
to some issues use fixed offset time

395
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:58,749
zones if possible ideally UTC UTC UTC

396
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,519
UTC that's what you get from this talk

397
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,999
UTC and use as time zones to converts

398
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,049
the user time zones on borders keep your

399
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,059
time zone database updated whether you

400
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,939
some privacy or they people use ISO

401
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,599
formatting for when if you need to send

402
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,539
your daytime that's a string arithmetic

403
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,250
operation can be tricky so what's

404
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,799
happened remember that future world x

405
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,099
cannot be mapped into things like some

406
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,720
libraries worth mentioning pi t said

407
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,820
just the also net ways they do till lot

408
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,880
of cool things and proper time some

409
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,540
support from

410
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,700
actually from starting from Python 3.6

411
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,910
with addition of these folder attribute

412
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,840
pretty interesting if you want to read

413
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,050
about it they recommend the library to

414
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,520
deal with things on this date utilities

415
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
it are on pendulum are just dropped in

416
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,800
replacement for daytime and Astro PI is

417
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,770
great to deal with leap seconds and free

418
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,510
scan this is the library that's gonna

419
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,230
save your life

420
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,300
because it allows you to test with times

421
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,700
you can say I want to my tests behave as

422
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,550
in it's this day or any specific dates

423
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,410
it will allow you to validate that

424
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,480
yourself or behave see as you expect

425
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,710
when you have all this kind of weirdness

426
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,460
with time so now we're going to see some

427
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,350
code samples and you have to you there

428
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,760
is a camera in the room which is

429
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,220
rendering life if you are right or not

430
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,100
and if you think that code sample is

431
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,280
good you really put your right hand up

432
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,880
if it's bad even do your left hand back

433
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,680
and there is a camera that will give us

434
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,800
the result in lifetime so first of all

435
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,350
we just get the current day time right

436
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,990
we just want that timestamp for our logs

437
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,510
and we call data hand hug exactly ninety

438
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,540
five point three percent of the people

439
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,020
know this is wrong we have to use UTC so

440
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,700
we have to pass UTC today time now

441
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
because otherwise your log will start to

442
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,540
you start to see weird things and it

443
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,730
looks like time going forward and then

444
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,560
going what one hour back and you don't

445
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,820
want that right you want an absolute

446
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,870
point of time next one there's not much

447
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,350
you can do a bit do you think it's death

448
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,610
so gonna be in the problem with this so

449
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,500
you have a time soon you get the similar

450
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,780
client and then you localize whatever

451
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,510
need a time you had so hands up right

452
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,050
left

453
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,170
wow so many people participated in this

454
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,150
and wow that's great so yeah

455
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,890
still the people that answer moving

456
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,720
alright this this is gonna cost you

457
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,820
problems because when you localize a

458
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,120
knife daytime with the time zone this

459
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,010
this function has a beautiful parameter

460
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,470
called East est which will tell you

461
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,030
whether you are in the is fault or not

462
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,040
like whether you you know whenever

463
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,700
you're in this specific situations were

464
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,549
you can have you haven't be with times

465
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,649
where there are some things that appear

466
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,409
twice because of their going forward and

467
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:57,389
going back where are they our this will

468
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,370
just silently give you one of the tea

469
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,559
and you don't even know which one you

470
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,950
can pass here is the s T equals known

471
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,750
and this is gonna throw an exception in

472
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,519
the situation next one I'm really bad on

473
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,769
time so I'm gonna skip this one you can

474
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,039
it's bad because they the UTC again

475
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,250
right and also because here we are

476
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,779
relying on the time being monotonic and

477
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:24,630
ascending and that's not always true all

478
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,990
via right even if you didn't answer what

479
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,860
about this one

480
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,590
we want to send the time T to a client

481
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,389
and we decide like hey I'm gonna format

482
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:34,950
it with this really cool format because

483
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,260
it's what I learned at school so the

484
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,760
times are gonna look like this who

485
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,880
thinks this is get it alright come on

486
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,990
cool cool you're getting better yeah

487
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,809
99.3% yeah we use sisa format right we

488
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:50,370
want to use the standards we don't want

489
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,289
just don't think about the poor guy

490
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,809
that's going to parse that see this is

491
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,669
you see some format and whenever you

492
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,470
whenever you you parse it you can use

493
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,750
something like they do to those dot

494
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,200
parse there's no or you can just use in

495
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,370
daytime you can use this TRP time to to

496
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,730
parse that last one really quick cuz

497
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,580
amount of time you want to get the total

498
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,899
number of seconds this is one is really

499
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,760
tricky but I know you are really good

500
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
with day times already so you want to

501
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,929
get the total number of seconds on three

502
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,399
years and you're gonna bet your salary

503
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,909
on this this is good bad come on it's

504
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:27,980
bad it's bad

505
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,740
great exactly 101 percent of the people

506
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,830
got this right that's new record why is

507
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,799
this bad because I'm Python doesn't deal

508
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,710
with leap seconds so this won't take

509
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,850
into account the lip seconds you know

510
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,090
for most of your use cases it might be

511
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,000
fine but again you just have to be aware

512
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,529
of this kind of issues that you might

513
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:54,960
face in total it's 99.999% of that's

514
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,460
great that's true yes you're an expert

515
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,049
so well I hope you got the be careful

516
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,940
with de times if you're just a normal

517
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,759
user of daytime just stick UTC and

518
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,200
forget about all the problems you have

519
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,519
really time-sensitive applications just

520
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,559
do some research because this is really

521
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,769
tricky and last but not least don't

522
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,480
worry this is not one of those lights

523
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,100
what I'm saying like come to have a

524
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,620
coffee to our company I will recruit you

525
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,559
and everything no no this is just so I'm

526
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,450
a member of the organization of the pipe

527
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,779
in Spain this year it's a hundred of

528
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:33,759
people come in awesome CTO some food

529
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,470
it's amazing right so beautiful that

530
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,529
that's what I study and we really want

531
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,210
you to welcome news basically if you

532
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,529
speak Spanish if you don't you're

533
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:44,200
welcome but the beam we might have a

534
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,240
track in English check this kettle if

535
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,649
you're a sponsor though you should

536
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,799
really have to looked into it because

537
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,149
20% of their people are unemployed in

538
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:53,679
Spain this is perfect environment for

539
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,730
recruiting that's it if you want to have

540
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,090
to a copy on our please come we can

541
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,129
speak about a lot of things like

542
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:10,210
recruiting and things that's all and I

543
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,879
have some more material if you don't ask

544
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:14,470
any questions and if you ask a question

545
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,629
I don't know the answer my guinea pig

546
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,370
will attack you on this night

547
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:38,539
no questions oh yeah

548
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,730
so if you want to take into account

549
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,230
bleep seconds when you're computing for

550
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,490
some light on the total number of

551
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,139
seconds I guess I guess your use case

552
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:46,700
we'll probably something astronomical

553
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,419
something like that

554
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:48,950
you should really haven't looked into a

555
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,960
strop I guess that's a library that's

556
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
have supports for leap seconds that

557
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,779
would be the right way to do it that

558
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,299
said if you when you're doing operations

559
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,769
like I want to see how many seconds

560
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:02,769
between today it's tough and you are not

561
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:05,509
that much concerned about the accuracy

562
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,190
of it you can just hold date night but

563
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,570
or really a great things used to be

564
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:20,929
pretty good they don't they like that

565
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,659
you we don't know the next five years

566
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,940
leap seconds like it's like the UTC just

567
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,999
decided hey leap second this year one

568
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,710
second more for you so there's no way to

569
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:38,659
know it yes that's that's really

570
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,419
interesting it happens as well I'm not

571
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,360
sure about data kill you cannot poll

572
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,340
which words are polygons is the main

573
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,809
month in them digitally he works at

574
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:51,289
Bloomberg more promotion here coming but

575
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,879
yeah it's an issue because for example

576
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:55,809
daytime doesn't go farther than I think

577
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,929
9900 Lola so you would have to Astro PI

578
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,549
again has supports for really long and

579
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:04,039
really past dates so you can have a look

580
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,519
to Astro pine

581
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,200
yeah so you you date util has a parser

582
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,960
which will try to infer the format so

583
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,560
you can just pass any date to to it sort

584
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,850
of like any string to it and it will

585
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,410
tell you it will give you back a day

586
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,720
time you want to use that only if you

587
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,370
really don't know the format because

588
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,470
it's because he tried to infer this is

589
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,030
I'm saying it because there is people

590
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,860
sending millions updates to it and

591
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,230
complaining about being slowed and pol

592
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,210
hey said because it really tries to

593
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,550
infer it so if you know the format

594
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,920
though you have a guess of two or three

595
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,720
formats you can pass today util I hate

596
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,310
those so that two or three four of us I

597
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,960
think they are otherwise you can tell

598
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,910
him like you know I have no idea what it

599
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,070
is just give me back a day time and he

600
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,930
will do the best a best effort you

601
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,060
really need to do the format always add

602
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,620
more content if you don't ask questions

603
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,580
it's time for okay cool so on this life

604
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,130
there is something about was the

605
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,620
different with UTC and GMT you can check

606
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,750
it and what's even more interesting is

607
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,850
how does the you know because we saw

608
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,350
this time standards but how does the

609
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,410
computer works right because like this

610
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,610
has a different color this is not a

611
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,380
session plug I don't know how session

612
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,270
smells but there's no a session plug

613
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,700
here so there's a protocol called NTP

614
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
which is really interesting if you like

615
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,740
this old daytime trace nest public

616
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,500
twenty P is really really interesting

617
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,270
that's all thank you

618
00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:02,770
[Applause]

619
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,369
[Music]

620
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,460
if we do nobody

621
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,460
yeah

622
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,119
