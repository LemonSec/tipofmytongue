1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,079
hi everyone

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,760
later years hi everyone so I'm gonna

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,239
present with my colleague Andres ring so

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,680
ring it's a fully distributed

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,490
communication platform so it's it's a

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,019
limited communication platform using a

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,060
few different disputed system to work

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,490
and so we're going to present you what

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,430
ring is how it works and how we

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,590
implemented those different distributed

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:44,170
system to design ring ok sorry for the

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,780
slides in French but this is basically

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,519
the different kind of distributed system

14
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,039
you can have so the classic kind of an

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,579
information system would be a

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,039
centralized system so you will have

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,440
everything on a single server or a

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,480
single a computer or node that will have

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,670
all information from everybody and that

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,170
will authenticate different users that

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,670
so that's the classic form of different

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,720
web services proprietary services that

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,690
are so many free software services are

24
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,420
hosted on a single server or by a single

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,750
organization the federated system is

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,210
what we use with emails so with emails

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,640
we have different servers those servers

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,380
can connect it between each other and

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,330
every user has a server is registered on

30
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,040
a given server so you send the email to

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,720
the server the server will communicate

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,810
with other servers and then this other

33
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,480
server will give the email to the other

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,690
end user and ring is fully distributed

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,400
so there is no Federation concept it's

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,180
really fully peer-to-peer

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,090
so ring these days on a circuit

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,038
certificate chain so when you create a

39
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,459
new ring account you will basically

40
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,850
generate a new very sexy pair so this is

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,970
the base of identity management in ring

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,300
so just as an interjection previously

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,310
for these versions of ring because this

44
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,569
incident as a project that's been in

45
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,800
development for quite some time

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,069
and recently a major advancement has

47
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,920
been the changing from the repetition of

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,269
your user name as the public key to a

49
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,209
user name that's bound to a public key

50
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,510
now that's being stored using blockchain

51
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,310
and distributed across the DHD so all in

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,810
a minute I'll give it demonstration that

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,130
creation of a ring account and your what

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,560
we call a ring ID is essentially your

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,709
your public key and this is now being

56
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,900
represented by user names so much easier

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,250
to use the software and through the

58
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,230
end-user experience you can look up a

59
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,220
name rather than trying to paste your

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,070
your long string of characters into a

61
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,109
pastebin or something like that what we

62
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,630
used to do where we implemented ooh

63
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,090
originally a QR QR code system so that

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,430
if you're using Android

65
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,110
or some device in the camera you could

66
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,819
take a picture the QR code and converted

67
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:31,750
to buts now recently in the past year

68
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,780
released just before the beginning of

69
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,700
2017 was the release of the beta 2 which

70
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,780
includes that functionality and as well

71
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,849
another major advancement which has been

72
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,280
the ability to add multiple devices and

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,140
to chain multiple devices into a master

74
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,540
account so for people who use

75
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,620
telecommunication systems on multiple

76
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,019
devices you can now use the same account

77
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,659
on one device with using you know the

78
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,359
DHT as well so and keeping everything

79
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:12,519
secure how they just goes to the

80
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,709
the archives here and I'll do a

81
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,090
demonstration of the way so so Andres is

82
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,850
gonna show on this laptop when you

83
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,280
create a new a new ring account height

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,010
goes so we try to make ring as easy as

85
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,350
possible to use foreign users so our

86
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,490
goal is to make ring just as easy as

87
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,000
that's to use as any other proprietary

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,660
proprietary communication software so

89
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,420
the absence of a central server should

90
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,790
be as transparent as possible for the

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,940
user so the user shouldn't care about

92
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,620
the existence or an out of a central

93
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,500
server as much as possible except of

94
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,620
course for users who understand the

95
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,560
implications of all this so as you can

96
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,380
see basically if you just generate a key

97
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,140
pair you will get a public a public key

98
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,870
that will be complex and you will not be

99
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,610
able to remember that key that public

100
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,160
key to give to other people so if you

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,830
are at some club and you want to give

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,650
some girl your identity and ring you

103
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,590
will not be able to give this long ID

104
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,530
it's not going to be possible

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,300
but you will maybe you might be able to

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,150
give just a username you're registered

107
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,030
so I'm I'm Bob wondering you know this

108
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,359
kind of thing

109
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,260
so we implemented user name registration

110
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,960
on the blockchain to be able to register

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,930
user names with without using any

112
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,729
central server so for this we used we

113
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,250
choose the atrium technology to have as

114
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,700
much flexibility as possible compared to

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,100
the black chain base name registration

116
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:22,610
systems so we use a turian in a

117
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,400
complimentary way with the classic DHT

118
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,090
that we use to find other peers on ring

119
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,030
so when you use your ring ID to contact

120
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,880
someone it will use the DHT distributed

121
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,100
system similar to be turned but fully

122
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,510
encrypted to find other peers

123
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,789
exchanged the IP address with the other

124
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,289
peer and then establish a peer-to-peer

125
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,169
TLS connection with you or the peer that

126
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,820
you found on the over the DHT

127
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,630
so now with a terraeum you will first if

128
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,940
you know the the name of the pure you

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,860
want to contact you will first do I look

130
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,810
up on the DHT so it's a free

131
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,190
instantaneous operation on the

132
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,630
blockchain and you will get the ring ID

133
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,750
ID corresponding to this user name and

134
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,080
then use the string ID just as you will

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
you know use an IP address that you will

136
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,450
result from a DNS address online so it's

137
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,860
basically just a name ring ID so it's

138
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,640
keepers registry is very light but it's

139
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,190
still not light enough to be on every

140
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,039
single ring device so every single ring

141
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,610
the node is at the HT node participates

142
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,950
give also resources for their peers to

143
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,340
reach each other but the blockchain is

144
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,340
too heavy the mining process is too easy

145
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,490
to run on every ring node so the ring

146
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,560
name server is a separate project from a

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,750
ring so when you install ring you don't

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,320
have a you know block a blockchain no

149
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,020
the mining or anything but you can

150
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,150
anybody can just clone the source code

151
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,680
of the ring name server and participate

152
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,510
to the existing blockchain so how do

153
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,630
people how do people find each other on

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,990
ring they used the open ght network of

155
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,880
injection network is a distributed hash

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,190
table that we created that software unix

157
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,460
to meet the needs of ring so open g HT

158
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,059
it's academia like have the who here

159
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,349
knows what our distributed hash tables

160
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,370
good good open DHT it's a distributed

161
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,120
implementation of a distributed hash

162
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,360
table that allows to store not just IP

163
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,220
addresses like BitTorrent but any kind

164
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,040
of data and we use it to store encrypted

165
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,839
IP addresses as I explained so when you

166
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,730
reach people with ring you will put your

167
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,160
encrypted I care dress and the other

168
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,839
person will reply and the DHT

169
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,700
I will show you but if you already know

170
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,470
distributed hash tables this world you

171
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,690
will mostly already know this algorithm

172
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,310
so this is the Academy algorithm every

173
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,880
node knows some parts of the network the

174
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,339
nodes that are the closest to the node

175
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,570
on I ID and you will then ask other

176
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:29,300
nodes iteratively you will ask the

177
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,360
closest node that you know

178
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,170
to the target ID until you reach the

179
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,300
target idea node will answer you with

180
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,910
the list of nodes that are the closest

181
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,600
to the target ID so that similar to the

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,310
technology used by BitTorrent to find

183
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,110
peers yeah so we use open DHT in

184
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,010
combination in combination with the

185
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,260
eternium blockchain based nemours

186
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,750
iteration and yeah we use them to create

187
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,200
this fully distributed network I think

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,029
do you have time so I do a demo of the

189
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,920
calculation okay we might do a demo yeah

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,779
well first of all although I'll just go

191
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,100
through the account creation is pretty

192
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,790
simple but gotta you obviously people at

193
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,380
the start of the implementation of this

194
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,440
the ethereum blockchain name service

195
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,079
giving people the option to not do such

196
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,010
a thing

197
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,170
see you don't really have to register

198
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,130
but by default it's the best idea so

199
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:45,370
I'll find something that so

200
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,930
so yeah this would be a local name I'll

201
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,599
create a ring account I'll register it

202
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,430
yeah yeah there's no hdmi cable

203
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,410
but essentially i'm just writing in a

204
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,060
couple fields the name that I'm gonna

205
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,160
keep you locally and the name that I'm

206
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,420
trying to register onto the blockchain

207
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:27,640
and then I'll supply a password it's

208
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,700
simple

209
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,040
so compared to the DHT using BitTorrent

210
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,770
in ring we implemented a new feature

211
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,070
that is here come listen so you can ask

212
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,170
other nodes to be informed of a change

213
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,600
of value at some given hash so when you

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,850
will be called for an incoming call for

215
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,130
instance you won't have to do some kind

216
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,840
of pooling every second you will be

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,270
Jerry you will received Network packets

218
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,040
from other nodes saying oh there's a new

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,470
value and then you will see how it's

220
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,140
someone trying to call me we try to

221
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,360
reduce as much as possible the impact of

222
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,670
the DHT Network and mobile devices

223
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,760
because the DHT network requires to keep

224
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,370
track of other nodes online send and

225
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,840
received packets continuously so it's

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,850
pretty bad for the battery on mobile

227
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,130
devices but where we have a lot of

228
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,800
internet projects to try to have like

229
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,250
proxy nodes or these kind of things to

230
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,560
reduce the load and mobile devices in

231
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,630
terms of battery and data consumption do

232
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,710
you have any questions about the

233
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,490
distributed design

234
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,930
sorry

235
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,680
pricks note so it's not implemented yet

236
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,920
but we think about it for a long time to

237
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,680
have nodes registering themselves on the

238
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,590
open jecheon perks network itself yeah

239
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,440
so maybe like the desktop version of

240
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,770
ring my might enable by default allowing

241
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,810
to proxy older nodes this kind of thing

242
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,420
yeah

243
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,980
the reason is that on the digital

244
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,340
network there's no way to be sure that

245
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,120
no one else will register the same name

246
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,730
you know so there's no a cryptographic

247
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,200
certainty that you will be the only

248
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:50,550
person to have this name exactly to

249
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,400
preserve the security of ring because

250
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,740
otherwise some other person could

251
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,230
register a name so when you are called

252
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,260
and this disorder person we will receive

253
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,360
the call and they then this other person

254
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,120
can act as an attacker as a madmen the

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:17,190
middle or anything yeah exactly so stop

256
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,820
me

257
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,950
registering a software for Linux or real

258
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,740
Donald Trump or Scarlett Johansson yeah

259
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,290
you can go to the google.com and

260
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,120
register a new Google account with any

261
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,140
name that is not currently registered so

262
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,670
we designed the blockchain

263
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,930
so that it has a cost to register name

264
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,730
when you want to do when you want to

265
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,140
perform a transaction in the blockchain

266
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,780
there is a transaction cost and there's

267
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,600
also a cost that can be defined in the

268
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,430
contract that can be arbitrary

269
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:59,650
so we designed the thing so that it's it

270
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,750
should cost you too much to register

271
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,580
every name that you register in the

272
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,590
blockchain has a cost to you so if you

273
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:30,610
want to register 1 million names like to

274
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,290
register a controversial name oh

275
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,970
something's really should belong to them

276
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,890
will be expected because real names mean

277
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,550
something right well that's that's a

278
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,380
question personally I have an answer for

279
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,720
that I mean because if I want to if I

280
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,970
want to register myself as somebody else

281
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,310
yeah I could do that on a lot of things

282
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,020
I guess you're saying that Google would

283
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,190
prevent you from doing them erasing

284
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,020
yourself as the real name of somebody

285
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,120
else if they if they didn't stop you

286
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,950
they have I'm pretty sure ways of fixing

287
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,080
it has to do Twitter and Facebook okay

288
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,230
they have the power to do that but must

289
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,100
we must

290
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,650
web services will allow you to register

291
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:21,070
any name where you want well the idea

292
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,470
behind the members discretion service is

293
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,050
that the first person to register on a a

294
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,480
name will have this name under service

295
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,070
but this called evolve in the future but

296
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:49,350
this is the the entire horrible but I

297
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,490
have been really encountered anything

298
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,920
like or any situations that everything

299
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,020
be similar there was issues we like the

300
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,449
DAO on the blockchain there was a a bug

301
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,310
in their code that allowed someone to

302
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,230
steal a lot of money but since it was

303
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,630
written that the blockchain nobody could

304
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,930
do anything about it so the community

305
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,430
decided to move to another blockchain

306
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,609
that fixed this issue so if there was a

307
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,349
major issue is the number of destruction

308
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,510
service we might decide the wall ring

309
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,910
community to move to some new directory

310
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,550
that will have new rules to fix the

311
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,350
issues that were uncultured in previous

312
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,360
versions of the blockchain and it could

313
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,420
be very well done to import most of the

314
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,800
names that were already there in the

315
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,060
previous block chain or this kind of

316
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,690
thing I mean I guess that is a concern

317
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,240
there's other there's other issues that

318
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,920
we're working on in the upcoming year

319
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,090
and implementing like being able to

320
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,450
change your password which is a core

321
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,120
feature that people need forget your

322
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,150
password mention this and we have a few

323
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:09,490
ideas yes absolutely

324
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,740
so the linux version has a debased

325
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,920
interface so you can control it with any

326
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,930
sort of thing that does a Debus

327
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,400
interface we have python scripts

328
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,890
ourselves to make automatic tests and

329
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,990
that also the yeah mostly and the judge

330
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,030
the core ring can be built as a library

331
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:36,450
and you can link a design clients

332
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,370
however like android does not use the

333
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,230
middleware somebody built the client

334
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,910
directly

335
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,930
the new for instance the version that

336
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,630
that I've spent a lot of time developing

337
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,460
which is the youth view of universal

338
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,090
Windows version of the client that also

339
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,770
does not use the middleware so we just

340
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,930
developed it right on top of the daemon

341
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,990
so pretty much anybody making your own

342
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,380
interface

343
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,200
no because it's udp-based and also it's

344
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,660
a real-time communication and tor is not

345
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,040
very well suited for real-time

346
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,730
communications

347
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,999
