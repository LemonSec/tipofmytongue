1
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:09,010
anytime I can sort all right so we're

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,500
gonna get started so this talk is about

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,299
localization of RF transmitters so if

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,710
you've been working in the wireless

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,830
communication community for some time at

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,590
some point you will work on localizing

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,210
RF transmitters all right there's been a

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,830
huge amount of money all through history

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,310
for these particular applications and

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,558
it's been at a standstill for quite a

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,379
while and then certainly when as the

12
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,449
arse came around there was a huge influx

13
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,519
again in in scientific community because

14
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,109
all of a sudden we can actually test all

15
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,100
those algorithms that we've been

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,850
developing for decades and this talk in

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,699
particular is targeting angle of arrival

18
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:50,289
estimations so if determining the

19
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:56,979
direction of an RF transmitter so how

20
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,870
would you do this classically well if

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,420
you want to determine the direction of a

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,339
transmitter you would use a calibrated

23
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:06,549
multi antenna array alright so you have

24
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,310
multiple antenna elements if the front

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,320
ends are properly calibrated you can you

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,060
look at the phase difference at each

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,270
received from off at the signal of each

28
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,520
receive antenna determine direction of

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,260
the transmitter has been tons of

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,750
algorithms has been published but is you

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,940
know music beamforming animal estimation

32
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,220
so on so what are the drawbacks of using

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,110
multi antenna arrays well there are

34
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,030
actually two big drawbacks the first one

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,400
they're quite expensive well you need if

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,110
you have four antennas you need four

37
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,820
front ends you know and this is kind of

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,990
expensive

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,910
even with software-defined radios it's

40
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,420
still big threshold financially the

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,790
second problem is these arrays directly

42
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,310
quite big alright all the antennas need

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,960
to be separated by typically half

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,030
wavelengths so if you have four antennas

45
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,430
here around one one gigahertz well you

46
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,440
have an array that's this size right so

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,730
not so practical to put in your cell

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,300
phone or in your laptop

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,240
so this talk presents way of doing angle

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,460
of arrival estimation with a single

51
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,739
antenna and combining this with IMU

52
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,899
signals which every cell phone has

53
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:11,780
nowadays

54
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,390
right so ID the ID is following imagine

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,069
you have transmitter which is sending a

56
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,560
periodic signal or just multiple signals

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,880
and you know the header of that of that

58
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,830
signal which would be the gate in any

59
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,680
practical standard as your receivers

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,780
moving around he receives several of

61
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,209
these different data packets and you can

62
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,010
see each received data packets as

63
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,959
virtual int an element and you can

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,840
combine the signal from these difference

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,420
from these different receive packets to

66
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,340
a determine direction of your

67
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,280
transmitter so the outline is going to

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,110
be as follows I'm first gonna show a bit

69
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,850
what are different challenges how this

70
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,410
differs from conventional MIMO

71
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,470
estimation show how we can solve these

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,690
different problems and in particular how

73
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,489
we can solve frequency offset problems

74
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,769
and how we can term in the location of a

75
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,590
receiver true I new processing and

76
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,420
finally we show some implementation and

77
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,110
some implementation results so if you

78
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,910
look at a regular MIMO array and this

79
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,860
virtual my mo ID you have two main

80
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,709
differences the first one is that in a

81
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,030
regular my mo array you know the

82
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,560
position of your antennas alright you

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
know your antennas are along an array

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,860
linear array and you know they have this

85
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,350
distance in between them you don't know

86
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,570
this in a virtual MIMO case you're just

87
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,489
moving around so you need to determine

88
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,070
where your receiver is each time he

89
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,010
receives data packets the second problem

90
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,560
is that you have frequency offset so in

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,269
a regular minor array you had don't have

92
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,799
any frequency offset between your signal

93
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,120
receives at the different antennas

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,440
because they all use the same local

95
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,950
oscillator in this case because you're

96
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,299
receiving a signal at different time

97
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,799
instants the frequency offset between

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,079
your transmitter receiver causes the

99
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,790
signal to have additional phase each

100
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,079
time you receive new packets all right

101
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,790
so just to illustrate his frequency off

102
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,590
the problem for this were a bit less

103
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,200
familiar with wireless communication if

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,329
a receiver who stands still here and

105
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,030
he's receiving multiple packets at the

106
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,350
first instance he's going to receive

107
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,620
some baseband signal RFM at the next

108
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,299
time instant at time t1 he's going to

109
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,070
receive the same signal with some phase

110
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,959
shift all right which is you the

111
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,430
frequency offset if not here

112
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:31,230
all right so if we have a line of sight

113
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,520
channel which we're going to take as a

114
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,140
main assumption here so we're not going

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,790
to deal with multipath channels at this

116
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,210
stage the face of each received packet

117
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,610
that gets is given by this following

118
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,340
term or you have some initial phase some

119
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,560
term due to frequency offset and then

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,540
some term due to displacement of the

121
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,030
receiver so if you remember this from

122
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,680
you know signal processing your antenna

123
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
course this is basically the beam

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,200
steering vector that you have so

125
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
difference between conventional MIMO and

126
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,610
it's virtual MIMO or these two terms

127
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,040
here which are in the red boxes so the

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,540
first one is a frequency offset which

129
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,790
you don't have in this case and the

130
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,680
second one is that you don't know the xn

131
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,050
and yn of your different virtual

132
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,100
antennas here alright so the first part

133
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,210
we're going to see how we can deal with

134
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,710
this term which is actually fairly easy

135
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,510
to deal with and then the second part

136
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,160
we're going to see how we can estimate

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,040
these xn and these yn terms using

138
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,910
inertial measurement units so the first

139
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,380
part we started with a very naive

140
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,930
approach say ok let's do a stop and

141
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,470
start brochure receiver first and still

142
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,180
only the frequency offset changes so we

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,070
estimated frequency offset and then we

144
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,200
use that when we start moving all right

145
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
to compensate frequency offset out of

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,660
our signals and once you do that well

147
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,280
once you compensate frequency offset out

148
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,410
you can use whatever angle of arrival

149
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,940
estimation technique you want you can

150
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,080
use as free music beamforming ml

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,480
whatever you whatever you prefer now

152
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,020
this works provided you have decent

153
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,030
figures a decent frequency estimation

154
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,340
when you're standing still and provided

155
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
the frequency offset doesn't change too

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,730
much between the moment years you

157
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,500
estimate it and the moment you're using

158
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,190
it to compensate it all right so

159
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,140
basically you should not wait too long

160
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,910
between your estimation and the moment

161
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,080
when you move so it also means that the

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,370
movement that you do should be quite

163
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,370
short now this is okay because if you do

164
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,350
angle of arrival estimation you can only

165
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,080
use these kind of algorithms

166
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,120
within a certain spatial area all right

167
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,919
so you cannot move too much otherwise

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,690
your stationarity assumptions are no

169
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,729
longer true but this is quite

170
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,349
impractical because that means that you

171
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:49,819
first need to stop and then you need to

172
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,470
start moving so you know in practical

173
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,240
scenario if you're imagining this in a

174
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,860
car or in the drone or something that's

175
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,750
not gonna work very well so there is

176
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,240
another approach which works quite well

177
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,270
which is just augmenting the signal

178
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,300
model that you use in your your

179
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,979
estimation in your angle of arrival

180
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,379
estimation I go it and augment it to

181
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,150
include the effect of frequency offsets

182
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,969
so if if you use this kind of signal

183
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,159
model in your music algorithm you can

184
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,169
just augment the steering vector to add

185
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,789
the term which is due to frequency

186
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,080
offset and then you can do a double

187
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,270
dimensional estimation over the angles

188
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,280
and over the possible frequency offset

189
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,610
values and we'll see that this works a

190
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,629
bit less but well it does work but it's

191
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,400
not stable as the stop and start broach

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,039
so the next big problem is how do I

193
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,349
detect what do I know the position of my

194
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,090
receiver every time we receive a packet

195
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,490
right so for this we're going to use I'm

196
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,620
you so I'm use this inertia measurement

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,449
unit it's something you have in every

198
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,159
cell phone they make MEMS I'm use it

199
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,819
just cost a few dollars now and I'm use

200
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,729
basically contain what they contain

201
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,580
accelerometers in gyroscopes right they

202
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,500
contain accelerometers wrong all three

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,840
axis and gyroscopes along all three axis

204
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,810
now you can use these to do that

205
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,110
reckoning navigation now if anyone here

206
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,000
is from the control community or if you

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,229
have been interested in this before you

208
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,340
know that this doesn't work very well

209
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,259
now the good thing is that in our case

210
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,729
we only need it to work for a short

211
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,770
amount of time we only need our position

212
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,259
over a few meters over a few seconds all

213
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,729
right so the MU solution doesn't have

214
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,769
that much time to drift off one question

215
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,078
we get a lot is why don't you use you

216
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,448
know some very fancy GPS for this well

217
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:40,940
the reason is that we need an accuracy

218
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,740
that's typically in your roof or a

219
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,449
fraction of a wavelength so GPS is not

220
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,590
going to give you that kind of accuracy

221
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,200
right the second reason is that if your

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,670
antenna radiation pattern is not

223
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,860
isotropic you also need to know the

224
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,200
orientation of your receiver right so

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,370
unless you're working with a linear

226
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,320
antenna and we're only in the XY plane

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,540
if you have something like a patent and

228
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,220
I on your phone then you do need to know

229
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,050
the orientation so you can take this

230
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,000
into account in your angle of arrival

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,470
estimation algorithms so just a few I'm

232
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,080
going to explain the challenges of I new

233
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,580
crossing a bit so this is a bit outside

234
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,920
of the wireless community but it's

235
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,620
actually quite fun and it's interesting

236
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,420
to know what are the limits that we can

237
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,760
reach with IMU when we work with

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,020
wireless because when you look at

239
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,580
localization and tracking people have

240
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,440
all sorts of crazy idea about what they

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,690
could achieve if they use I new and it's

242
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,320
actually very disappointing performance

243
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,440
so I'm you basically has works as

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
follows so you have this I knew which is

245
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,620
attached to your vehicle so in our case

246
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,180
the vehicle is just the phone we're

247
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
moving around and it gives you the

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,110
acceleration and angular speeds along

249
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,650
each axis in the reference frame of the

250
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,420
IMU so if you turn your IMU around

251
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,470
you're turning your reference frame

252
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,940
around so you need to somehow convert

253
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,980
this to a navigation frame which is the

254
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,010
absolute frame you're working and so one

255
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,540
of the big problems of I'm use is that

256
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,850
the accelerometers are also picking up

257
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,070
the gravitation field of the Earth's

258
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,520
right so you're one of your I new axis

259
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,230
is going to pick up an acceleration of

260
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,810
9.8 meters per second square all right

261
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,370
so if you're perfectly flat it's gonna

262
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,020
be the z-axis but as soon as you tilt

263
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,520
your IMU you're gonna have this

264
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,440
gravitation vector along multiple axis

265
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,220
of your eye on you and why is this a

266
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,900
problem well the whole I'm you

267
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,730
processing chain is as follows you have

268
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,460
your Chivers curve signals and you

269
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,530
integrate so this measure angular speeds

270
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,480
you integrate this once and you get your

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
orientation right then you use this

272
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,310
orientation to project your acceleration

273
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,260
signals from the body frame so from the

274
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,150
frame from the IMU to the navigation

275
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,430
frame to the absolute frame and then you

276
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,020
need to remove the gravitation vector

277
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,310
right so you can measure the

278
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,900
acceleration that are only due to the

279
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,600
movement now this is big 9.8 meters per

280
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,670
second square is very large compared to

281
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,850
what

282
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,440
we have with typical movements if I'm

283
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,149
moving something like this I'm gonna

284
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,000
have something like 0.5 meter per second

285
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,940
square so removing this is a big

286
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,160
challenge and to remove this correctly

287
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,899
you need to know the orientation quite

288
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,910
accurately and that's a huge challenge

289
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,649
when you do this kind of processing

290
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,019
because any error you have on the

291
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,579
orientation here it's gonna get double

292
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,589
integrated in the end and it's gonna

293
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,920
cause you jairs and the errors are going

294
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,029
to increase over time all right so few

295
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,800
problems that you typically have in our

296
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,709
new estimation is how do I determine my

297
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,839
initial orientation I can put my

298
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,850
immunity able here and say okay I'm

299
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,560
perfectly flat and zero zero zero

300
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,019
degrees in your pitch roll that's not

301
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,550
gonna work very well because my table is

302
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,339
never perfectly flat as an order of

303
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,180
magnitude 0.1 degree in error results in

304
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,750
about one meter after five seconds all

305
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,889
right and this this this error increases

306
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,110
with the square of time all right so

307
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,380
this grows really rapidly

308
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,240
so obviously you need to Cal you need to

309
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,189
go through some calibration procedure if

310
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,630
you have a very good iron you can do

311
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,250
this calibration once every six months

312
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,600
if you have a very bad one you need to

313
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,740
do it pretty much every time you turn

314
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,829
the on and then there are some kind of

315
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,740
tricks from the control community to

316
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,970
increase the ability of these I new

317
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,110
measurements I'm not gonna go into

318
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,290
details here so let's go to the

319
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,759
implementation which is really more

320
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,600
interesting sigh here we put this on a

321
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,410
USRP software-defined radio so the

322
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,380
transmitter is just sending the 3G

323
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,449
primary synchronization sequence so this

324
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,110
is a sequence which runs at one point

325
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,990
eight megahertz more or less and it's

326
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,850
very periodic all right so it sends the

327
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,550
same sequence every every 667

328
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,120
microseconds

329
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,949
well the transmitter is just sending

330
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,889
this through UHD so we're just using the

331
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,709
radio and USRP sync and repeating the

332
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,139
same packet over and over again the

333
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,209
receiver samp over samples by a factor

334
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,880
of two and we do part of the processing

335
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,329
of the receiver in the USRP officiers we

336
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,680
just do the correlation in FP

337
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
year to offload some of the more heavy

338
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,730
processing we could have just saved

339
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,899
everything in a batch and processed

340
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,520
offline but you know this is much more

341
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,420
fun to do plus we also need to actually

342
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,250
read the data from and I'm use this is a

343
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,010
rather high in time you it's something

344
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,170
that's used for more expensive vehicles

345
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,480
it's in your of a few hundred euros

346
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,380
Sherma correct so we have a treads on

347
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,450
the in new radio that's reading in

348
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,370
parallel data from the IMU and data from

349
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,010
the US RP and combining them in some

350
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,020
meaningful way and dumping everything to

351
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,250
an output file which you can process

352
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,120
offline so yeah I'm you it's reading

353
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,550
data fairly low rate compared to a radio

354
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,740
and that's it so how do we do the

355
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,630
experiment to the start if all this

356
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,270
theory actually works well we go to an

357
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,610
anechoic chamber to do some very clean

358
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,279
controlled environment experiments

359
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,230
well first we don't have any multi pad

360
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,180
so that's always nice when you want to

361
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,680
try out something for the first time and

362
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,170
especially because we have the turntable

363
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,839
of the anechoic chamber so you know that

364
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,250
technically chambers usually have this

365
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,750
turntable to turn antennas in all

366
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,010
direction around so you can measure the

367
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,779
radiation pattern well we're going to

368
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,550
use the turntable to generate movements

369
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,680
that we know so we know that to move and

370
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,330
should be about we're going to turn in a

371
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,810
semicircle here we know we know how far

372
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,520
away from the center of the turntable we

373
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,589
are so we have this very controlled

374
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,450
movement at least we're gonna see how

375
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,640
our new processing does with respect to

376
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,839
the movements so these are just a couple

377
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
picture from the experiment nothing

378
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,550
exciting so you have our USRP or antenna

379
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,100
here and this little orange box is the I

380
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,360
knew that I placed there

381
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,070
now I said at some point that you need

382
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,720
to estimate the initial orientation of

383
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,820
your IMU well now you see why this is

384
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,589
important I cannot guarantee that this

385
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,870
is perfectly vertical right so you do

386
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,040
need to estimate your initial

387
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
orientation of this I'm not going to

388
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,850
speak about it but there are quite a few

389
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,529
papers in literature that deal how you

390
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,750
can do this using gravitation vector so

391
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,390
what kind of data do we get so this is

392
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,029
just a new processing at first so these

393
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,190
are your accelerometer signals Dirac

394
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,959
tellurium accelerometer signals that you

395
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,610
measure so as you can see around the

396
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,240
z-axis

397
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,770
you have something that's very close to

398
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,980
10 meter per second square and this is

399
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,390
our actual acceleration that we're

400
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,370
trying to use to determine the movement

401
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,350
so you can see the order of magnitude

402
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,410
difference that you have between this

403
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,000
term that you want to cancel out and

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,740
what you're actually using to determine

405
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,490
your movements so gyroscope signals are

406
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,830
typically a bit cleaner so here you can

407
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,360
clearly see that we have a rotation

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,510
around the z-axis mainly but there is

409
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,339
something happening along around the y

410
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,930
axis as well this is because we're not

411
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,170
perfectly vertical so when you do this

412
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,330
whole processing true Kalman filter

413
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,459
through an extended Kalman filter you

414
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,020
can eventually get the orientation so

415
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,640
you can see here that we're turning from

416
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,220
roughly 180 degree to 0 degree which

417
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,260
corresponds to the movement of the

418
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,680
turntable these are the speeds along

419
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,050
three axes of the I'm use can see most

420
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,970
of the speeds along the x axis which

421
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,980
should be the case given how we place

422
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,910
our IMU and this is what we get as the

423
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,130
final result of one of the experiment

424
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,709
runs so we start at zero and you can see

425
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:34,230
it towards the end we not quite we don't

426
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,190
quite reach the 180 degrees there so at

427
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,839
the end of the movement we typically buy

428
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,250
we have an error of around 10

429
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,529
centimeters all right so this is still

430
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,360
good enough to do what we're trying to

431
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,910
do but you cannot make any longer

432
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,310
movement so this is this movement takes

433
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,770
about five seconds to make and this is

434
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,020
kind of the limit that we can reach with

435
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,850
this particular mu so let's go back a

436
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,209
bit to the radio signal what do we have

437
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,679
here so this is the phase of each

438
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,959
received packets over the whole duration

439
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,369
of the experiment so we're standing

440
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,900
still for 30 seconds and then we're

441
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,459
moving around here somewhere

442
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,829
so if i zoom in on that you can clearly

443
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,109
see the effect of frequency offset all

444
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,209
right so every packet has certain phase

445
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,750
shift compared to the previous one you

446
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,609
use a standstill period to estimate

447
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,230
these frequency offset and then you

448
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,000
cancel it out and then you get this

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,040
figure here so this is the phase of

450
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,929
every received packet so we have a

451
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,429
packet every 667 microseconds which is

452
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,240
why this is fairly continuous

453
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,549
and you can see two things here here you

454
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:42,230
can see something which looks a bit

455
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,740
noisy so this is just random walk noise

456
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,330
so this is actually phase noise all

457
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,130
right you're standing still so the only

458
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,630
thing you're seeing is frequency offset

459
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,309
and phase noise so you can see there's a

460
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,140
little bit of drift but not too much and

461
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,659
then you can see here that you have a

462
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,080
very clear pattern alright and if I were

463
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,250
to show you all the runs of the

464
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,840
experiment you would see that's the same

465
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,669
pattern over and over again well because

466
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,620
you're always making safe movements so

467
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,890
obviously you expect the face the phase

468
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,390
relationship to always have the same

469
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,309
pattern so this is the IMU crossing I

470
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,049
already showed on the previous slide and

471
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,450
then when you combine the phase of the

472
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,850
different signals and the position every

473
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,260
time you received one of these packets

474
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,230
and you enter this into angle of rival

475
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,330
estimation of the range such as music so

476
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,000
in this case we use music you get the

477
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,620
music spectrum and you can see that you

478
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,409
have a clear peak here which is at 94

479
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,510
degrees which corresponds to the set up

480
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,220
we have any anechoic chambers the real

481
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,929
angle is at 90 degrees were a few

482
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,559
degrees error and if you repeat this

483
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,169
experiment or a couple of times you get

484
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,690
a root mean square which is given here

485
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,240
for different radiuses so we put yeah

486
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,830
I'm you in the radio at different

487
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,029
distances from the center of the

488
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,460
turntable and you can see that when we

489
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,039
have a bigger movement we have smaller

490
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,570
error and this is actually quite

491
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,250
interesting because this is in agreement

492
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,870
with what you have in mind materi

493
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,179
if you have larger array as long as

494
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,159
you're not subsampling spatially you

495
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,169
have better resolution alright so we can

496
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:16,580
find the same result in here so this is

497
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,529
for the stop and start proach also told

498
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,240
you about this joint beam forming where

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
we estimate the angle and the frequency

500
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,669
of the joint so this is your music

501
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:28,039
spectrum if you do the search over the

502
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,720
two dimensions all right so this is

503
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,590
frequency offset and this is angle and

504
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,080
you can see that you have well something

505
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,919
that's fairly typical of of this kind of

506
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
music spectrum you have a main lobe here

507
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,429
a main peak and then you have a bunch of

508
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,289
side lobes all right

509
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,690
but in our case if I take a horizontal

510
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,159
cut off here you can see that you have a

511
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:51,830
nice main peak which is a nine

512
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,299
six degrees we still have some error

513
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:58,880
right so it's not perfectly neat but it

514
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,890
has the advantage of not having to stop

515
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,980
before remove Minh all right so if you

516
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,630
look at all the experiment runs you can

517
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,279
see that for smaller movement here is

518
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,010
quite disastrous you know this is very

519
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,289
very large which compared to

520
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,480
conventional techniques they exist but

521
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,399
for bigger movements we get close what

522
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,750
we have with a stop and start approach

523
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,390
so you know there is some trade off some

524
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,950
trade off here this is much more

525
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,340
flexible but it's less precise right so

526
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,100
there is still room for improvement here

527
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,409
most of the error is due to the I new

528
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,480
estimation all right so the IMU drifts

529
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,580
off so if you think your antenna is not

530
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,190
where exactly is this is going to affect

531
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,789
your music element by quite a bit so one

532
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,380
way to deal with this would be to lower

533
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,049
the impact of later measurements during

534
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,320
the movements

535
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,789
all right so final step is we are

536
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,710
currently in the process of pouring this

537
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,200
on the III 10 USRP so it's the one

538
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,840
that's Martin showed a bit before it's a

539
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,480
small one that has embedded embedded

540
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,610
processor so why do we want to do this

541
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,830
well first of all it's a fan platform I

542
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,580
need an excuse to do something on that

543
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,740
it has the embedded I'm you which is of

544
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,690
much lower quality than what we use in

545
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,100
this previous experiment so this would

546
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,049
allow us to see okay what can we achieve

547
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,299
if we use something that's typically in

548
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:25,549
your phone all right okay it's not as

549
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:26,899
bad as what you have in your phone bills

550
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:31,130
you know not that far away it also

551
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,500
allows us to use worse quality OC air

552
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,110
and eventually we want to put this on

553
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,899
the quadrotor that one of my students is

554
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:44,630
working on here so we have the whole SDR

555
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,090
which will be controlling both the

556
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,539
quadrotor and the radio aspect so where

557
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:53,179
do we stand well the green parts are

558
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,980
what has been done the red part is

559
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,159
what's missing here so part of the

560
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,960
processing is done in the FPGA again so

561
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,730
this one through some work was I wasn't

562
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,080
using our stock so that's my fault

563
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,559
and it took some time to get it get up

564
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,879
to speeds and with the u.s. our p3

565
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:13,899
generation of the FPGA we have

566
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,269
everything that's working when we use it

567
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,399
in a simulator even when we feed it with

568
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,489
actual measured USRP signals but when

569
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,080
synthesizing the whole thing I will run

570
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,269
out of slices so yeah we have to find

571
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,080
some way to optimize this or offload

572
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,149
some of the some of the processing I'm

573
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:36,190
gonna show some results that we have on

574
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,539
the IMU processing because that's

575
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,090
probably the most interesting thing I

576
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,899
can show here so I'm gonna skip a few

577
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,309
slides here because I'm not really not

578
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:46,330
that interesting

579
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,489
so we did this control experiment where

580
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:52,269
he puts the e310 on X Y position area we

581
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:54,340
moved it and you know this is a very

582
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,230
precise positioner so we know how much

583
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,019
we moved it exactly so we could see

584
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,759
however I'm you crossing does compared

585
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,730
to real movements now one thing I need

586
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,769
to mention here as the results are going

587
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:10,450
to be a bit scary at first is that the

588
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,489
error on the IMU only depends on the

589
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,649
time that you do dead reckoning

590
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,570
navigation it doesn't depend on the

591
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,590
actual movement all right so now that

592
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,269
you know this and this turntable is

593
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,009
actually moving fairly slowly it's you

594
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:27,999
know moving at you know only what 10

595
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,850
centimeter over five seconds something

596
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,600
like that so you know and this is the

597
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,669
year we get so the black line here is a

598
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,619
real movement that we generate and the

599
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,799
blue lines or the I'm you estimated

600
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,139
trajectory so you can see that for a 10

601
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,440
centimeter movement here we have around

602
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,269
five centimeters of error at the end of

603
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:52,330
the run right but it's not a ten

604
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,950
centimeters verse five that you need to

605
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,419
think of but we have five centimeters

606
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,580
there over a four second run all right

607
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,989
so this is the way you should seat over

608
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:01,149
four seconds I can move my cellphone

609
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,369
much more than just 10 centimeters all

610
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,649
right when we go for longer runs

611
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:08,559
movement at last say 10 seconds well you

612
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,999
can see it here increases quite

613
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,690
dramatically

614
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,940
we're almost to half meter error here

615
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,340
right this is why people don't use

616
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,629
i-news when they actually do that

617
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,480
reckoning navigation

618
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,860
you can see it's the error is always

619
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,620
going in the same direction so this is

620
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,360
there is some leftover bias after a

621
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,820
collaboration procedure we did the

622
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,410
calibration procedure on the day before

623
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,260
the experiment and on this type of I

624
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,170
amuse the stability of your MU is really

625
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,330
not that good so you need to repeat the

626
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,670
calibration before every run all right

627
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,180
so this brings me to the end of my talk

628
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,060
so this is just some high-level idea of

629
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,350
what you can do with software in

630
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,580
different video when you want to try

631
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,500
really new things so here we're really

632
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,420
about trying to do angle of arrival

633
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,970
estimation with a single antenna which

634
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,280
is you know something quite new and

635
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,070
quite unexpected a lot of people said

636
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,020
you know just saying not possible well

637
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,760
it's actually possible you need to do

638
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,820
some sensor integration in there so you

639
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,110
know a bunch of things that we need to

640
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,680
do a little comment so if you want to

641
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,970
have this code I usually don't publish

642
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,060
my code because I'm pretty poor software

643
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,940
programmer but if you send me an email I

644
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,210
will send it to you because I don't want

645
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,160
to have people who just take it think

646
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,420
it's plug-and-play because it's usually

647
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,010
not there is still some you know

648
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,950
tinkering that you need to do so but if

649
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,540
you're interested in this please get in

650
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,010
touch with me and I will send you the

651
00:25:36,010 --> 00:26:00,760
code so that's it thank you yeah so the

652
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,230
question is if there is a magnetometer

653
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,550
on the IMU well yes there is I've talked

654
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,400
a lot with people from the control from

655
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,110
the control side or these things and

656
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,370
they all disadvantages because they're

657
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,220
very sensitive to electric fields if you

658
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,780
have a computer running next to it this

659
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,250
is going to affect your magnetometer

660
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,770
reading and this might be critical in

661
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,420
the long run so yeah in general people

662
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,260
don't use magnetometer so much

663
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:43,270
yes yes no this is based on men's I'm

664
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,000
you so the idea is that we want so the

665
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,520
question was if we use a gyro laser

666
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,770
which are much more precise gyroscopes

667
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,809
that are used in planes so the idea here

668
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,030
is really to go with low-cost elements

669
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,669
to eventually you know the idea to long

670
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:58,960
run is to say okay I can take my cell

671
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,789
phone through this and you know have an

672
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,860
angle of arrival estimation this will be

673
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,150
really cool that's also one of the

674
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,860
reasons to go to the e310 because you

675
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,909
know it's small enough that you can do

676
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:08,740
this at a conference and get away with

677
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:19,750
it so we haven't addressed looking at

678
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,090
GPS in this case it's something that's

679
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,539
on the long term to-do list let's say

680
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,710
there are certainly ways that you can

681
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,320
use GPS data whether it's just GPS

682
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,139
position or the metadata from satellites

683
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,720
yeah so we haven't done that now

684
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,100
Thanks actually enjoy doing new stuff

685
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,879
[Applause]
