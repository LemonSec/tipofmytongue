1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,110
I've been been warts developed in

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,420
rosslyn javascript in mains made safe

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,630
which actually the main supporter of

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,840
safe which he will talk about more but

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,530
more about been in his technical side

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,280
been develops application API for

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,680
developers basically but he's also a

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,219
community person he writes he faciliate

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,719
community events and he cares about

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,089
human aspect of open source software

11
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,949
ready yeah alright let's welcome been

12
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,739
talking about the safe thank you

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,649
so for our audience in the livestream we

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,289
can go to time arrived accomplished safe

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,109
- D - Internet I feedback loop here

16
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:10,509
right it's it's we write is that better

17
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,649
it's okay you can go there and you can

18
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:18,869
look at the slides while I also do them

19
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,969
so let's get right started so I'm Ben hi

20
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm software developer educator

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,109
architect I write about software

22
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,100
development as well I do freelance open

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,409
source hashtag all the hashtags if you

24
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,789
want to learn more about me you can go

25
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,649
to Guney corner org or follow me on

26
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:37,210
Twitter but we're not here to talk about

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,909
me we're here to talk about the

28
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,359
impending doom of civil society and what

29
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,729
we can do to fight the four horsemen or

30
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,700
in a more positive way it's time to

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,490
freakin save the Internet

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,610
[Music]

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:10,750
which microphone okay want to is that is

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,330
that better all right great

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,260
was it okay I should I do the

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,879
introduction again I think it's okay

37
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,330
right

38
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,840
you got you got the gist of it okay so

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,819
because we have a big audience here and

40
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,319
we're not I'm not sure we're all on the

41
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,690
same page let me start by painting a

42
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,140
little bit of a picture first imagine a

43
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,370
society so well developed that all of

44
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,870
the world's knowledge is at your

45
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,170
fingertips with a device smaller than

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,810
your hand that fits into your pocket you

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,349
can connect to anyone and everyone on

48
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,660
the globe instantaneously and you can

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,340
share messages with them you can share

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,620
images videos heck you can even

51
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,209
livestream your your current protest to

52
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,569
the world and infrastructure so immense

53
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,430
and all compassing that not only

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,829
citizens governments and institutions

55
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,500
are using it even like other

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,419
infrastructure is based on it for its

57
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,930
communication like the power grid or

58
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,569
cars yet it can be taken down by a

59
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,910
toaster

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,160
now imagine that everything you do in

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,310
this network is tracked everything that

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,530
you look at everything that you share

63
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,440
with someone else is recorded by

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,130
governments and and corporations alike

65
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,739
excuse me and not only in the online

66
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,530
world that is inside this sphere you see

67
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,620
here using the same device that you have

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,500
in your pocket you are tracked even are

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,599
flying in the meat world and the little

70
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,400
privacy that within the system you have

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,019
left you actually have to trade in

72
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,000
voluntarily

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,070
in order to gain access to the system in

74
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,560
order to share this picture with your

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,490
friends and your family

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,740
you have to upload it into that entire

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,950
infrastructure even though this

78
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,040
infrastructure is incredibly bad at

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,750
keeping that safe and secure

80
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,230
like seriously bad I really recommend

81
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,390
this page the I'm gonna tweet the link

82
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,060
to the to the slides afterwards this is

83
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,430
a link to information is beautiful which

84
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,020
is just having like these bubbles of the

85
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,940
latest data breaches and it goes all the

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,120
way back to 1994 and it's like it's you

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,460
should click on it it's just terrifying

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,250
and all of this information that is

89
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,650
available in there allows to paint a

90
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,550
really accurate and terribly good

91
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,830
picture of you and your social

92
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,620
connections of you and everyone in your

93
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,290
field of vision everyone you talk to and

94
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,600
we do know that now imagine that this

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,460
kind of mass surveillance system and

96
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,230
tracking system falls in the hand into

97
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,630
the hand and under the control of a

98
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,050
demagogue a bigot or fascist now I don't

99
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,090
I don't have to tell anyone in this room

100
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,620
that what I just described is not

101
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,590
attacked dystopia or sci-fi movie or

102
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,150
some sort this is the Internet today all

103
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,520
you looked at just right now is public

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,320
knowledge these are headlines of the

105
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,500
last three to five years this has been

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,480
happening all over the place and all the

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,800
time but that is not the Internet that I

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,390
signed up for that's not the Internet

109
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,680
that I that we fought for back when we

110
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,660
started all of this this is not what we

111
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,180
wanted so what are we going to do about

112
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,800
it well first we need to take a serious

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,780
look at what I mean a really serious

114
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,020
look into why is that even a thing

115
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,610
why are these all of these problems even

116
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,980
possible and when I when I when I say a

117
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,020
serious look I mean that we really need

118
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,690
to find the root problems of our

119
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,390
infrastructure let's take the DDoS as an

120
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,810
example it's very easy you all remember

121
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,669
the headlines that it was fridges and

122
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,050
fridges

123
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,789
and webcams that cost this and of course

124
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,949
there is a big cry that vendors should

125
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,629
secure their devices more and that's

126
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,690
correct they should but by focusing at

127
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,340
the conversation only on that we

128
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,050
distract ourselves from the actual

129
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,930
problem that our infrastructure is so

130
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,349
weak to a degree that an attacker with

131
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,159
enough power could still do this even

132
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,620
even if all of these devices are secured

133
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,180
because they could just buy other

134
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,020
devices more devices as they please

135
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,370
similarly talking about the the mass

136
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,729
surveillance apparatus we we focus and

137
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,069
talk about righteously so that more

138
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:02,800
things should be encrypted that more in

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,870
transit conversation communication

140
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,360
especially should be encrypted and shout

141
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,979
out to let's encrypt they have done an

142
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,349
amazing job there with getting so much

143
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,379
more the internet under HTTPS but that

144
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,139
only helps so much if the NSA is still

145
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,099
on that server in their opinion lawfully

146
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,069
and righteously so because it doesn't

147
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,539
really matter if we can transfer the

148
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:26,949
information to the server securely if

149
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,509
it's then not secure and similarly even

150
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,099
even with the end-to-end encryption

151
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,639
systems that have been deploying we

152
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,860
still rely on these relay servers

153
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,979
in-between so if the NSA is on those and

154
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,940
I'm sorry to say but I assume they are

155
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,159
from everything we know then they still

156
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,840
have a vast amount of information which

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,310
is every message even though it's

158
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,039
encrypted going from there to your other

159
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,990
party and they know that you are the one

160
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,400
talking to the journalist so the the the

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,960
real real problem that we need to

162
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,150
address here and it's uncomfortable and

163
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,650
we don't like to talk about it too much

164
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,919
is that we have in in the Internet in

165
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,870
the public Internet a central server

166
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,969
paradigm and we need to move away from

167
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:17,199
it quick and we to some degree we know

168
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,289
this we know that networks that are more

169
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,529
decentralized are more resilient more

170
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:28,449
stable and and it I guess to most people

171
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,190
in this room it's obvious that a full

172
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,630
peer-to-peer network is the most

173
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,789
resilient way that you can define any

174
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,169
type of service and we know

175
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,479
we have been actually deploying a lot of

176
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,909
these services on the internet in

177
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,789
various degrees of decentralization

178
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,110
already like email for exact example as

179
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,360
a federated system it while it's

180
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,820
possible to DDoS and technically take

181
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,329
down Gmail com email as a service is

182
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:01,089
impossible to take down and that's good

183
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,310
yet the the big issue isn't really on

184
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,110
the bottom part there baton as well it's

185
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,029
very good at this the bigger issue is

186
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,790
the one on the top we still have a lot

187
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,180
of services that rely on central service

188
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,480
somewhere and this one for example the

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,540
service that I want is not a forum I

190
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,310
want that specific forum with that kind

191
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,600
of data and we address those with these

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,610
systems and that's a problem because let

193
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,310
me put it another way

194
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,540
you mentioned the following conversation

195
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,399
between me and my friend I'm like hey

196
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,230
dude this this amazing book that I read

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,459
the other day you should definitely read

198
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,390
it it's like oh yeah you're

199
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,949
Reclamation's are really great what book

200
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,440
is it and I respond oh you can find it

201
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,209
in the Harvard library on the second

202
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,920
floor our last shelf on the top shelf

203
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,370
sevens to the right natural conversation

204
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,240
I have everyday nobody thinks of

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,399
addressing something like this except us

206
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,709
we are in the information technology and

207
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,640
we address things by their location the

208
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,680
example I just made is exactly that when

209
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,339
when I go to a resource in in on our

210
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,040
forum for example the way I address is I

211
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,170
have this Harvard library which points

212
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,720
to a physical location an IP in this

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,890
particular case and then the second part

214
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,910
of this this URL points to where I find

215
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,529
this resource in this particular

216
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,800
location at least that's the paradigm

217
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,269
that we are using like if you go to

218
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,120
Gmail comm the second part behind that

219
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,100
is not talking about the physical or

220
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,779
more or less physical location on a

221
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,209
specific server anymore

222
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,949
that's just virtualized but it would

223
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,930
still apply very much that you would go

224
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,580
to the Harvard library and then

225
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,190
them the path and they look it up some

226
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,290
other means and they give it to you you

227
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,850
still need to go to the Harvard library

228
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,630
to get that but how do we how do we in

229
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,760
the actual vault address things not by

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,830
that because my friend would have to go

231
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,300
to the Harvard library to get this book

232
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,610
and there's probably many other versions

233
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,470
of this book out there that they can use

234
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,200
instead so instead what I'm telling them

235
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,870
is it has this author it has this title

236
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,970
and maybe I have an ISBN for them and

237
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,150
they can go to any library or any

238
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,100
bookstore and ask them hey do you have

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,120
this book and when when I say this book

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,820
in our real world we don't actually mean

241
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,790
the physical object either when we talk

242
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,390
about a book we mean its content and we

243
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,460
address it already in our natural

244
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,500
language that way because they don't

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,540
care if they have the physical identity

246
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,960
and identity copy than I had before or

247
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,820
when I read it because we can assume

248
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,830
that the other one is equally equally

249
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,320
good so this is the end general concept

250
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,750
or the idea of content addressing and

251
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,250
this is already existing in in a very

252
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,460
simple way the ISBN is a content

253
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,230
addressing system with the chance for

254
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,410
registry but we also do you have this

255
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,750
and we moved on from this URL concept to

256
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,990
the URI in the internet as well the

257
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,090
easiest form of content and we have

258
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,510
computers with math massive amounts of

259
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,360
calculation capacity then one of the

260
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,890
easiest ways for us to address content

261
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,320
is through their check sums and we have

262
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
a variety of checksums we can use this

263
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,780
one is for example the sha-1 sum for the

264
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,040
content test and we have been even

265
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,500
addressing things in the wider internet

266
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,330
this way you might have seen those

267
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,240
called magnet links this is actually

268
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,830
valid magnet link if you put it in you

269
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,700
should get a content test somehow from

270
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,640
BitTorrent patron has actually deployed

271
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,450
this in 2006 and whenever you have these

272
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,890
magnet links and you click on them today

273
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,550
in most most piracy web sites

274
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,860
you would you would still be able to

275
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,230
find this content without ever talking

276
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,250
about a physical location per se so but

277
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,740
what is this this is nothing else than a

278
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,190
really big number in a number space that

279
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,709
we can also write in decimals that is

280
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,149
like I'm writing it out like this

281
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,410
because it's like really big this is

282
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,600
sha-1 that isn't even like 265 or

283
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,450
something but it's just a really big

284
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,430
number you can't argue that everything

285
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,279
is a very big number but like if you

286
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,360
read the first thing a lot of people

287
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,399
would assume it as a string it's just a

288
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,440
very it's just the hax representation of

289
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
a really big number that's correct and

290
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
you can also write it down in base two

291
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,339
of course so but how does then in a

292
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,430
fully distributed bit or network without

293
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,350
trackers I'm not going to go into what

294
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,190
those were

295
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,220
or still exist how can we actually find

296
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,279
something well technically we need an

297
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,610
index of all the content that we have or

298
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,860
that is known and we need to map where I

299
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,690
can find this still like at some point I

300
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,920
still need to find a physical location

301
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,950
where it's actually stored right but

302
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,750
just looking at this really big number

303
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,370
that is going to be a really big index

304
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,890
and asking every participant in the

305
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,050
network to hold this really big index is

306
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,300
going to be incredibly hard to even like

307
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,880
just keep up to date

308
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,910
so what bittern did back in 2006 when

309
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,190
they introduced this new system is

310
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,350
something called distributed hash tables

311
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,450
and in the particular version that we're

312
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,649
going to talk about it it's Kedah

313
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,430
million routing so the idea is that

314
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,899
while you can't identify any type of

315
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,839
content with a number that is just the

316
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,699
hash of it so it's always unique to that

317
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,279
particular content whenever a node joins

318
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,190
the network they also get a random

319
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,820
number in the same number space and then

320
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,500
what you do is you calculate the

321
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,100
distance between any node and any

322
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,620
particular piece of content by just

323
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,850
using very simple mathematical

324
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,970
operations in the system because it's

325
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,709
really simple for computer to do we're

326
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,600
using XOR which is why as Austan of

327
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,089
often also referred to as the XOR

328
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,670
namespace

329
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,589
so you can just ignore two binary

330
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:19,809
numbers if if this is too complicated

331
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:22,689
just think of it in terms of subtraction

332
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,429
you have a node and you have a

333
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,399
particular content and by using this you

334
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,589
can define a specific distance between

335
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,410
any particular nodes in the network to

336
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,110
any other node as well as between any

337
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,069
node and any type of content now any

338
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,100
Content not any type of content and that

339
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,480
allows us to do something very

340
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,549
interestingly because through that

341
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:49,899
distance we can compare how close in a

342
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,799
virtual sense one object is to another

343
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,739
one object is to a note or two nodes are

344
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:57,850
to one another

345
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,160
without any reference to physical

346
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,829
location or something similar so when

347
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,350
when we think about this you can think

348
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,110
of the entire namespace as a big group

349
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,970
of people that you can just number

350
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,290
through and when you join it what you

351
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,899
can do is you you just look at the

352
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,610
network and you compare the distance

353
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,470
between you and all of the other nodes

354
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,379
in the network and can divide it in

355
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,439
areas and what you want to do is you

356
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,809
want to have a connection into each one

357
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:33,999
of these areas and you want to have

358
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,290
connections to everybody who's very

359
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,459
close to you now if you want to look up

360
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,589
a file you have the shah's arm and you

361
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,240
can calculate the distance between you

362
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,139
and that particular file and you can

363
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,720
also very simply calculate the distance

364
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,949
between all of the connections that

365
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,389
you're holding because you know the the

366
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,279
IDS of the other participants on that

367
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,209
side to you which means that you know

368
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,649
you don't have this file or you don't

369
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,269
have the responsibility to know where to

370
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,669
find this file but you know who is

371
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,770
closest from all the people that you

372
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,270
know that one now they do the same thing

373
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,130
they they don't they don't have to file

374
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,470
themselves they check and they figure

375
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,319
out o of the participants that I hold

376
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,270
very close they're doing the same that

377
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,220
we do by holding everybody who's very

378
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,589
close to them at our connection they

379
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,029
figure out yeah but there's someone else

380
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,790
who's closer and they know that

381
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,980
they are closer and they do the same

382
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,720
thing they figure out oh wait I have

383
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
this file I am

384
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
closest to this and they respond oh yeah

385
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,570
sure I know where to find this file

386
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,120
please go there to that connection that

387
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,310
they already have open to this relay

388
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,710
note and they just translate that give

389
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,820
that information back to me with that

390
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,830
system we can very easily define

391
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,030
responsibilities in a peer-to-peer

392
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,850
network of notes who are constantly in

393
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,340
and out because as soon as that note

394
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,080
goes goes away someone else is closer

395
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,810
and is supposed to hold that information

396
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,130
especially if we define this

397
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,430
responsibility not as one but four or

398
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,410
five nodes have to have this information

399
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,200
and are responsible for it it's very

400
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
easy to have a rather resilient system

401
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,850
where if one of the note goes out

402
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,280
someone else again becomes closer and

403
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,900
they just transfer the information to

404
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,720
the other closed party at the same time

405
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,790
even though it is a huge number of nodes

406
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,680
and depending on on how many divisions

407
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,110
you do and how many open connections you

408
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,690
want to have between 8 and 64 depending

409
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,680
on the system itself you can you build a

410
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,690
binary tree to every piece of content

411
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,460
that has very few virtual hops it takes

412
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,070
only very few actual connections that I

413
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,640
that are already open to to hop to that

414
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,410
specific content even though it's a

415
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,440
massive a massively huge namespace that

416
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,890
we're talking about this system this in

417
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,620
particular is cut at academia forward

418
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,120
routing because one thing that you saw

419
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,610
that it did is rather than that relaying

420
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,680
note telling me that the other node has

421
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,990
that information the other node passed

422
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,880
it to the relay node and they passed it

423
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,800
to me and that has another interesting

424
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,670
property in which that is obscurest

425
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,880
occation of these relating parties so

426
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,550
imagine that you have the hash of a file

427
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,460
and the NSI figure out which node is

428
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,290
responsible for that file and they want

429
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,780
to track whoever is who else tries to

430
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,430
access this file like let's say a

431
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,660
Wikipedia terrorism article now they are

432
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,050
able to find this node in a physical

433
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,700
space that infiltrate them and they they

434
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,180
are on this node

435
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,130
they can see is that there's requests

436
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,740
from the real a note coming in for that

437
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,350
file connections that are already open

438
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,770
and even to the real a note is unclear

439
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,810
who holds that file it could be that

440
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,610
this particular note still has another

441
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,970
note that is closer and they asked them

442
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,530
as well as the real a note doesn't know

443
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,180
that I'm the one asking I could also

444
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,160
just be a real a note that takes that

445
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,100
information and forwards it again

446
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,830
thus especially because the goes of over

447
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,500
four to five hops usually up the skates

448
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,570
very well whose excepting accessing what

449
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,620
neither end of the party knows them at

450
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,750
all now with this being deployed in 2006

451
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,360
why isn't everything on on the

452
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,130
centralized a decentralized system yet

453
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,870
well turns out there's another really

454
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,640
another thing that central servers do

455
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,950
very well and that is transitioning of

456
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,950
state specifically finding consensus

457
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,540
about what is the current state for for

458
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,850
quite a while we have like if you if you

459
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,130
want to know what the law is and the

460
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,870
king is the law all you need to do is

461
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,720
ask the king it's a very easy ruling

462
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,050
system but in a decentralized system

463
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,640
especially if we say we want to have

464
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,720
nodes that are equal among another we

465
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,740
can't have a king so how do we find out

466
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,770
what is the current state of things or

467
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,260
how do you find consensus without a king

468
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,440
well effectively it's the question of in

469
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,000
every democracy how do you actually vote

470
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,250
and as anybody who has ever been into

471
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,830
anarchist or leftish movement unanimous

472
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,650
voting is the thing that always comes up

473
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,730
and we also have implemented the

474
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,250
unanimous unanimous voting through taxes

475
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,970
and raft and as some examples where

476
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,820
essentially a group of nodes whenever a

477
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,030
decision needs to be taken is talking

478
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,740
among another until they agreed with the

479
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,080
new status depending on how you

480
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,700
implement this though

481
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,330
that could mean that every node you add

482
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,559
doubles the amount of messages that are

483
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,260
required and everybody knows a unanimous

484
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,120
voting system as soon as one of them is

485
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,460
not actually working very well or

486
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,679
doesn't want to respond in this way and

487
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,380
finding a decision can be quite hard and

488
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,940
can be blocked for for long periods of

489
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,490
time so very often we only implement

490
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,919
partisan draft in terms to elect a new

491
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,840
leader in a master minion system for

492
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,900
example like PostgreSQL clusters do

493
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,820
where you have a master and if the

494
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,520
master falls away they use a raft style

495
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,350
system to figure out who's the next

496
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,630
master but doing this for every

497
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,820
transaction would actually take too long

498
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,000
and would be just too much traffic

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,140
another very famous example of

500
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,750
distributed a voting system is actually

501
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,659
Bitcoin if you think about it in in a in

502
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,960
a more sociological sense what Bitcoin

503
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,289
does is a majority voting of the global

504
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:51,110
state it requires 51% of the nodes to

505
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,770
agree on the next state and they use a

506
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,530
predefined process to that everybody

507
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,480
agreed to do in order to make this

508
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,210
happen which is specifically the longest

509
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,640
chain idea which is followed on the idea

510
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
that you reduce the number of potential

511
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
electable x' in the first place by

512
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
making really hard puzzles so the

513
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,299
possibility that you have to forking

514
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,520
chains or many chains going on

515
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,919
for a long time is already quite

516
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,140
unlikely and if you have to you have a

517
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,140
majority vote and you can elect the next

518
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,070
state but everybody who is has ever done

519
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,650
a massive amount of voting system or

520
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,090
just votes in Europe knows that general

521
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,610
elections take time getting the majority

522
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,789
to agree on something is not that easy

523
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,490
even even in Bitcoin if you think about

524
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,049
it yes we have this ten minute time

525
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,610
frame that it takes to make this next

526
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,860
blog but until there's no other

527
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,559
competing chain anymore until that

528
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,940
particular point is reached you don't

529
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,919
actually have reached consensus that

530
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,600
this is the new state because there's

531
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,309
still a competing one that the majority

532
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,010
could still agree on and that actually

533
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,620
happened and in in December last year

534
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,900
where unintentionally

535
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,690
an update was made to the Bitcoin client

536
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,780
that made half of like a big part of the

537
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,160
older system incompatible

538
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,270
unintentionally

539
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,210
so they created transactions that

540
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,010
weren't compatible and the new version

541
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,130
just continuously made a new fork for

542
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,070
about six hours until they they released

543
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,740
a fix for that and six hours of

544
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,880
transactions actually rolled back

545
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,380
because they were continuously running

546
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,450
so this system hasn't actually found

547
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,450
consensus for six hours but even the ten

548
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,940
minute time window if I upload my file

549
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,700
and I want to share it with my mom I'm

550
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,710
not gonna wait ten minutes to be

551
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,790
confirmed that the pictures actually

552
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,660
online so that is not really an option

553
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,630
either

554
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,000
but you remember routing um you remember

555
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,610
that I specifically talked about that it

556
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,000
allows us to assign responsibilities

557
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,180
rather than just files and and I

558
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,500
mentioned that before let's assume that

559
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,630
I'm I'm responsible here for this

560
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,060
particular file responsible in this case

561
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,640
could for example mean that it requires

562
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,740
me to agree that we do a change to this

563
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,810
file for example by on the basis that

564
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,210
you're sending this file with the update

565
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,680
with the signature that I can confirm

566
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,140
you own this file by checking the

567
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,830
signatures I already have connections to

568
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,500
everyone else who's also responsible for

569
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,750
this particular file so when this

570
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,760
request come in comes in I can do a

571
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,400
majority vote among these other close

572
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,180
allies to me and we can agree really

573
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,180
quickly with a majority vote on already

574
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,580
existing connections whether that is the

575
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,430
new state or not and within a

576
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,680
peer-to-peer system I have the incentive

577
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,430
to always do what is expected for me to

578
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,090
be happening because if I misbehave my

579
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,980
deck direct counterpart my next neighbor

580
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,710
is be like yeah you seem to be broken

581
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,530
I'm gonna disconnect from you and you're

582
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,810
out of the system so it's in your

583
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,460
interest even though you don't know the

584
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,140
file if you don't know what it's about

585
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,890
to confirm these updates as long as they

586
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,040
apply to the protocol

587
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,140
and we can use this mechanism to model

588
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,950
all times all types of processes and and

589
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,650
status changes and transactions it

590
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,630
doesn't only have to be this file has

591
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,420
this particular signature because we we

592
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,350
define a closed group of of notes who

593
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,650
are responsible and by being part of the

594
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,510
network and wanting to stay in the

595
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,840
network you are required to take any of

596
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,540
those we call them personas specific

597
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,180
roles within a process that is assigned

598
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,100
to you purely on the fact that you have

599
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,050
a specific distance at this moment in

600
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,920
time that your n numbers close to a

601
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,980
specific type of thing happening within

602
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,830
this in the sphere at this very moment

603
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,690
so for example in this case I can really

604
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,700
see the the language the first part

605
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,310
confirms that when I want to upload a

606
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,840
file to the to the network that I have

607
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,840
the credits to do so that my client is

608
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,300
allowed to do this and only by having

609
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,190
the confirmed step the next step happens

610
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,600
and there's completely different notes

611
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,420
responsible to figure out how and where

612
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,180
to store that file and they need to

613
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,370
agree on that and that means we can

614
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,620
actually have various types of data

615
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,310
types that we store in this network one

616
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,410
thing we have inside the network itself

617
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,920
is an authentication mechanism so we

618
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,220
have tokens in the network that are that

619
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,870
you need to know the address for and

620
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,110
then you have a pin to decrypt it on the

621
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,030
client side and they confirm on the node

622
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,820
and they confirm yes this is another

623
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,740
indication token that you do decrypt it

624
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,600
then they send it back to my client and

625
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,450
I have a local secret key that I can

626
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,460
that allows me to actually decrypt this

627
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,800
decrypted thing and then I can act on

628
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,750
this network and they can confirm that

629
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,360
well yeah this key exists this is there

630
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,780
and this is mine through that system or

631
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,640
immutable data which is another data

632
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,320
type that we have in the safe network

633
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,710
which is defined as the address must be

634
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,320
the hash sum of the chunk that you're

635
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,650
trying to store it's a very simple

636
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,290
process but it's a process nonetheless

637
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,390
that every node when you try to store

638
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,460
that information it's going to track

639
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,630
if that doesn't match they're gonna

640
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,649
refuse and we're also currently working

641
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,659
on a new version of mutable data we had

642
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,370
a range of different data types but

643
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,350
we're we're currently condensing this

644
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,380
down to a key value pair style system so

645
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,140
like a hash table if you will that you

646
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,279
can even share specific permissions to

647
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,960
so you could give an AB or another

648
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,260
person the possibility to add entries to

649
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,710
that list but not to override or delete

650
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,340
and all you need is this close group of

651
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,630
nodes that agree that this is the

652
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,059
process they they have to do with the

653
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,059
majority voting another thing that you

654
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:12,770
can think of in this in this space as

655
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,990
well as you could use it for a currency

656
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,940
as mentioned before you can model any

657
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,399
type of data type so why not create

658
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,309
something like a file coin or safe coin

659
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,700
how we call it and the process or one

660
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,590
process that you could imagine around

661
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,230
this is that I can only transfer the

662
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,049
ownership of this particular coin if I

663
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,840
am the owner at this point so I have to

664
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,210
send a signed request and the nodes

665
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,820
confirm or deny this request based on

666
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,590
the fact whether this coin is owned by

667
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,190
me or not and if it is then they change

668
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,010
the ownership to someone else and the

669
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,809
interesting part about this is that if

670
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,860
you do it that way that's that's it by

671
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,250
by having this consensus about this you

672
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,080
assumed afterwards that the convinced

673
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,850
consensus has been reached properly in

674
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,549
the past so you don't need to keep a

675
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,370
record of it so where I got that coin

676
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,740
from before when I transfer it to you

677
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,159
you don't know and after I transferred

678
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,020
it to you and you transfer it to someone

679
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,250
else nobody knows that you got it from

680
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,919
me either so in many ways you could

681
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,480
model a system that is much closer to

682
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,899
cash then it would be to most of the

683
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,850
blick blockchain type of currencies

684
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,500
today which is transactional based and

685
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,539
that's an interesting property because

686
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:31,190
we're not talking about this enough and

687
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm not going to go into that here but

688
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,049
that money forgets is incredibly

689
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,350
important for an economy that you're not

690
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,870
able to track down that what I just paid

691
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,650
my pizza with five

692
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,810
bag has actually been used to paid for

693
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,650
drugs is very important in our legal

694
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,250
system so I mentioned the safe Network a

695
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,190
couple of times now and this is this is

696
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,650
so what what is it what is it the safe

697
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,840
network is a decentralized privacy first

698
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,400
open-source data storage and

699
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,710
communications network that provides a

700
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,270
secure efficient and no cost

701
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,320
infrastructure for app development so in

702
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,540
its in its highest level view what it

703
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,800
does it's a peer-to-peer storage

704
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,080
mechanism using exactly the storage

705
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,270
mechanism as just described through the

706
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,360
extra namespace and X are writing which

707
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,190
means that with that we can also easily

708
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,770
build data retention right into the

709
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,290
network because whenever a node goes

710
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,630
down another node become its responsible

711
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,570
now to have this piece of theta and the

712
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,190
other nodes that are also close to them

713
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,000
then transfer the information over in in

714
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,100
our system we currently have everything

715
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,050
stored eight times it's probably like

716
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,910
there's no different mathematical models

717
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,620
but it's probably okay to have four or

718
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,410
five times and even in a net split

719
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,220
you're most likely still gonna get it

720
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,750
but we said when we say privacy first we

721
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,420
mean that and that among other things

722
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,280
means unless the application

723
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,740
specifically says so everything is

724
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,350
encrypted by default before it leaves

725
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,590
your computer either through your

726
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,990
private key because it's your data or a

727
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,000
public key because you're giving it to

728
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,310
someone else or through a shared key

729
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,630
because while you're sharing it with

730
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,480
someone but we even go one step further

731
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,590
when we say everything we mean

732
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,270
everything even the stuff that you

733
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,200
consider public we encrypt through a

734
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
mechanism in which we split split the

735
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,590
file into smaller chunks and then

736
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,660
encrypt each individual chunk with the

737
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,390
previous chunks we create smaller pieces

738
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,990
of data which are complete garbage and

739
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,240
these pieces of data are then stored in

740
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,790
the network and all you need is is a

741
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,620
data map that helps you look at all of

742
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,600
these things put them in this order and

743
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,990
then you can translate it back to to the

744
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,990
actual file that you want to have and

745
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,060
that is that is an important thing that

746
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,560
because just because you say that a

747
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,350
piece of theta is generally public does

748
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,560
not mean that you trust the person who's

749
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,590
holding it in a peer-to-peer system

750
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,960
where any random node could be assigned

751
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,950
to to hold your private pictures you

752
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,720
don't want every creep to see your

753
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
private photos and by doing this

754
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,270
mechanism they all they store is a

755
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,720
really random weird chunk of theta that

756
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,790
has another nice benefit from for one

757
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,620
side it means that me as the person

758
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,420
storing that data I don't know what it

759
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:33,780
is

760
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,220
which gives me plausible deniability

761
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,200
even if it's something that is might be

762
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,690
legally problematic in my jurisdiction

763
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,240
but not necessarily where where they're

764
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,250
stored in the people who store it from

765
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,760
and equally so by obfuscating everything

766
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,870
you make it much harder to figure out

767
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,240
which is the sensitive information if

768
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,890
you only encrypt the things that are

769
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,810
important then it's really easy to

770
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,970
figure out which parts I should decrypt

771
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,770
because it's the only thing that are

772
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,380
interesting but if everything is garbage

773
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,870
that is on that system then I don't even

774
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,360
know which one might have been the one

775
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,239
with the sensitive information it allows

776
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
us another interesting property right in

777
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,969
there by being able to by doing this

778
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,949
process and having it this self

779
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,690
encryption process designed in this

780
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,668
particular way and we can make sure that

781
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,530
for the same file you always end up with

782
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,830
the same chunks and as we store them as

783
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,320
immutable data meaning their hash is the

784
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,889
address in our network if I uploaded the

785
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,780
file before let's say it's a movie and

786
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,909
you upload the same movie we only store

787
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,570
it in the network once not twice three

788
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,550
times or as many times as it's needed

789
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,290
which is a it's a very different

790
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,360
mechanism than what you think about even

791
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,580
for entering encryption if I share the

792
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,219
same video right now with my friend and

793
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,590
my family it's actually sent over the

794
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,270
wire twice and it's encrypted twice

795
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,460
while in this case it would be self

796
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,380
encrypted on the network and it would

797
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,060
only store I would only encrypt this

798
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,100
data map and send that over which is

799
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,180
much more amount of data

800
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,410
I've mentioned before as well so I'm not

801
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,020
going to go into that too deep that with

802
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,700
with the system we can provide

803
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,410
self-authenticating and registration

804
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,930
meaning you can add you can create

805
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,030
accounts with the system without any

806
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,560
third party you don't need made safe you

807
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,940
don't need me you don't need to know

808
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,500
anyone you just connect to the network

809
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,140
and you can create a new account and the

810
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,060
network and the structure inside of it

811
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,470
holds all of that information and

812
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,880
moreover we're building this in the

813
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,020
intention to create a fully and allow

814
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,760
for an infrastructure that is built

815
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,170
fully on decentralized and distributed

816
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,200
absent services so by thinking of it

817
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,720
that way like every every node has their

818
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,210
role and if a node goes down if you DDoS

819
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,090
any of the participants of the system

820
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,740
and they go down and now that one takes

821
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,500
over the service would always be

822
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,080
available and because there's no better

823
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,210
word I'm usually using descent reputed

824
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,300
as a combination of both this has been

825
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
in the works for quite a while we've

826
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,330
been working on this for over 10 years

827
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,730
now and there's a there's a bunch of

828
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,470
things in there this is just the main

829
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,150
features each one of them is actually

830
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,760
worth the fight a 45-minute talk and I

831
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,800
was only able to like quickly talk about

832
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,570
the extra namespace the group consensus

833
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,150
and and we touched the the safe coin for

834
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,890
a moment there and I want to I want to

835
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,330
take another minute on the safe coin

836
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,880
because I think when you ask the

837
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,560
question of why didn't we upgrade the

838
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,680
internet yet you very quickly come to

839
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,410
the conclusion of the tragedy of tragedy

840
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,260
of the Commons that it's not in anyone's

841
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,730
particular incentive to do so

842
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,280
everybody would benefit equally from it

843
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,580
which means that if if I as a company

844
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,650
have DDoS protections I actually have a

845
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,150
competitive benefit over my my

846
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,340
counterpart that doesn't so it's

847
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,540
actually more interesting to me to not

848
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,390
have this upgrade in the system because

849
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,630
it makes me better and I think one one

850
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,960
key mistake we did back then is that we

851
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,550
didn't really think about that too much

852
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,010
what incentivizes people to upgrade and

853
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,630
we have been struggling with the ipv6

854
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,600
update forever I think for a similar

855
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,970
reason so what we what we intend to do

856
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,580
in the

857
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,500
system is that when you provide storage

858
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,690
or any type of resource for that matter

859
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,330
to the network you you are rewarded for

860
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,270
that through a currency and in order to

861
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,160
store information on the network or use

862
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,740
resources like computation later you

863
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,950
need to pay this currency and that means

864
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,990
that in the mid and the long term run we

865
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,390
create an economy that allows us when we

866
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,880
have new features they allow for new

867
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,440
revenue it's interesting for the

868
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,330
participants of the network to upgrade

869
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,510
because it means they can use more of

870
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,340
the resources not only get used but they

871
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,290
can also earn better through that so

872
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,570
what can you actually do with this we've

873
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,250
been building a few example applications

874
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,750
and I'm rushing through them a little

875
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,800
bit so the most obvious one EXO

876
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,630
namespace is still not very readable so

877
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,670
yeah there's a public naming system and

878
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,620
again this is doesn't require a central

879
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,860
registry we can just is we can just say

880
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,020
DNS is the hash of the name that you're

881
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,800
looking at and whoever claims this piece

882
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,160
of data first they own that domain done

883
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,600
and in there the we expect a key value

884
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,460
of service-oriented design so www means

885
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,200
there's probably a website behind us or

886
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,240
public key means this is a public key of

887
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,030
that particular DNS name so this allows

888
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,960
you for example to publish websites on

889
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:57,310
the system which obviously also means in

890
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,110
order to access the system because it's

891
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,270
not HTTP and you need to do this

892
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,640
multi-step routing system in order to be

893
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,040
able to access it then you need a

894
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,740
browser and the particular browser we

895
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,690
have has another nice little feature on

896
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,210
top of that which is a JavaScript API

897
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,240
that the website can use in order to

898
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,060
connect ask the user if they can connect

899
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,540
to the network on your behalf so for

900
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,750
example they can read the recent list of

901
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,110
of Commons on a blog but you can also

902
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,180
use that very same system to build fully

903
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,340
interactive web apps as well so for

904
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,080
example we've built a markdown editor

905
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,960
that allows you to restore nodes

906
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,680
fully encrypted transparently encrypted

907
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,390
through give through the given access of

908
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,070
that user on the web for you or the

909
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,040
example I took before as well you can

910
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,050
use that to ask the user if you can have

911
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,790
in case they want to comment on a blog

912
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,430
you ask them for the permission to store

913
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,180
data in their name on the system so when

914
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,000
whenever you write a comment that also

915
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,640
means that you own it because you were

916
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,860
the one putting into the system and you

917
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,590
give a an link basically to that

918
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,110
specific comment to the list of comments

919
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,240
and everybody can read it but nobody can

920
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,210
ever change it other than you nobody can

921
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,940
ever delete it other than you because

922
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,500
you own this piece of data and we have a

923
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,210
that's an interesting changes in the

924
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,160
perspective of what it means to own data

925
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,720
because it's not the physical location

926
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,190
anymore and you don't have to write in

927
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,710
terms of services an app can store stuff

928
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,380
on my behalf and I am the owner the app

929
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,530
is just interacting with my data and

930
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,300
decorum is another decentralized forum

931
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,280
idea which does exactly that where you

932
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,470
say we have thread conversations but

933
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,430
every post is owned by you and all you

934
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,590
do is when you wrote the post when when

935
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,180
the software with the post it tells a

936
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,450
central central authority where to find

937
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,150
this post now but it's yours nobody

938
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,370
could ever have changed it the system

939
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,250
guarantees that another app we have and

940
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,740
that's simple but very interesting case

941
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,950
because of the inherent system that we

942
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,420
have in there we have a public key

943
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,640
infrastructure built into the system and

944
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,890
we exposing that through the API meaning

945
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,870
that you can very easily build an email

946
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,520
service let's call it AB rather that

947
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,650
just knows that it when it when it finds

948
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,770
email in your DNS that there's a public

949
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,890
key and a public identity where you can

950
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,750
write stuff to anybody can write stuff

951
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,500
to and then you use that public key to

952
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,060
encrypt that email so they can be sure

953
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,220
that only the person that put that key

954
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,730
into that DNS entry can actually read it

955
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,040
and when you do that you can use

956
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,930
or private key to sign this message as

957
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,640
well so the email client when it shows

958
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,200
up and reads through all of these things

959
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,810
that can confirm that the email is

960
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,090
actually from you and that is

961
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,880
transparent to the user no exchanging of

962
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,270
keys nothing of that needed and mostly

963
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,950
transparent to the apps as well

964
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,920
and last but not least we only have a

965
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,600
safe launcher which is basically entry

966
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,260
point and control center to the to the

967
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,800
system so I hear you somewhere between

968
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,930
shut up and take my money and are we

969
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,070
there yet I have to say unfortunately

970
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,160
hold your horses similarly as the the

971
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,240
PI's

972
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,750
the symptoms walk there it's longer and

973
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,270
bumpier than you might expect the system

974
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,620
looks fine in an architecture of one

975
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,270
point but it's not that easy to

976
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,090
implement have reliable peer-to-peer

977
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,570
system but we do have an alpha running

978
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,420
for about a year now early last year and

979
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,130
we just released the latest version of

980
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,430
vaults this Thursday volts are the full

981
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,560
nodes that do all of the personas and

982
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,930
all of this activity and make sure that

983
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,670
connections drop they find other ones

984
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,510
and stuff and we're currently working on

985
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,240
the mutable data as mentioned before but

986
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,620
another thing that that's very important

987
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:17,320
to us is that we can do this on mobile

988
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,660
as well while we have to admit that

989
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,080
mobile volts are probably a little

990
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,960
further ahead we do want to have at

991
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,080
least mobile clients so the email this

992
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,030
actually work for mobile as well so with

993
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,160
with that said one of the main reasons

994
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,620
I'm here is I want to ask you to join

995
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,850
the resistance if it's if it's because

996
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,590
you want to hack on what a rust code

997
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,950
we're all our base cord is in rust or

998
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,080
you're just curious about how this could

999
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,840
work if you if you want to do the

1000
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,600
bindings of the library that we're we're

1001
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,680
doing for other languages we're

1002
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,510
currently doing the nodejs version but

1003
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,240
we want Python we want C++ it's rust so

1004
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,520
it's it's a very it's rather easy way to

1005
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,729
do it

1006
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,650
or if you just want to run your own

1007
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,859
vaults join the network of course you

1008
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:10,969
have to prove that you have the

1009
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:13,880
resources which currently means sex 6

1010
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,279
megabytes upload so not everybody gets

1011
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,039
connected but you can go to that URL and

1012
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:21,799
and and download the code and and join

1013
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:25,069
the network or if you're if you're more

1014
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:27,019
interested about the aspects of what

1015
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:29,719
does it actually mean if we had this

1016
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:33,410
kind of system for building applications

1017
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,539
building privacy first applications

1018
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,789
where I as a developer never even know

1019
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:41,059
your data have never seen it and don't

1020
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:44,179
need to I'm currently writing an e-book

1021
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:46,249
about this topic which is also going

1022
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:48,589
into ipfs and some other systems like a

1023
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,959
theorem swarm and compares what they are

1024
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:53,869
doing and asking the question of how do

1025
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,719
we how should we build descent repeated

1026
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:59,929
apps in the future and yeah you can

1027
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:01,729
connect me you can talk to me right

1028
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:04,819
after but also go to the website and

1029
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:07,449
find me a screw nakorn ban on on Twitter

1030
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:10,099
this is a pixelated stormtrooper because

1031
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:11,869
every slide to actually have a

1032
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:14,089
stormtrooper here's a bunch of more

1033
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,759
links to the project itself and the ways

1034
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:18,349
you can join and with that I'd like to

1035
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,949
say thank you

1036
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,960
[Music]

1037
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,490
all right thank you so much we've got

1038
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,869
just a few minutes for question and

1039
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,820
answers first of all the doors at the

1040
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,970
top are closed so if you want to leave

1041
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,160
please a get away from the other door

1042
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,420
and please keep it quiet for the

1043
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,750
question and answer questions so I see

1044
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,290
one person

1045
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,240
I'm also please keep your hands up if

1046
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,109
you've got questions I'll get there so

1047
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,830
that was fast

1048
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:59,130
I'll come here right that was fast yes

1049
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,670
so hi ban that sounds awesome

1050
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,830
bottom line from my point of view is

1051
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,190
getting rid of location based addressing

1052
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,040
and to centralized networks towards

1053
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,320
something decentralized more resilient

1054
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,850
it sounds really great

1055
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:23,770
but we as engineers we know that there's

1056
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,840
also a trade-off when switching from one

1057
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,850
paradigm to another so from your point

1058
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,070
of view what is the major trade-off we

1059
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,860
are facing here and not only in terms of

1060
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,410
technical but also also in terms of

1061
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:43,240
social or legal stuff well so I think

1062
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,370
this is what I'm trying to also go into

1063
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,350
into the book from an engineering

1064
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,030
perspective it's a change in paradigm

1065
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,680
which means we need to get get not get

1066
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,900
rid but we need to let lose of the idea

1067
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,000
of what we had before we always thought

1068
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,120
of this one CPU of this one entity that

1069
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,650
has access to all of that information

1070
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,470
and that builds the social graph I think

1071
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,090
we have already in the in the last

1072
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,760
couple years seen more decentralized and

1073
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,400
distributed databases but it's it's a

1074
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,270
vast change of how you perceive data and

1075
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,750
how you interact with the data that I

1076
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,610
think that is the the biggest challenge

1077
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,500
for for most of the things and there's a

1078
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,150
few things that I honestly haven't

1079
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,430
figured out yet like how can you model a

1080
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,010
social graph in this without every

1081
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,800
warden telling everyone who they like

1082
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,340
and and having this public knowledge but

1083
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,450
I think it's about time that we start

1084
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,430
asking these questions in a more privacy

1085
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,410
manner because yeah the the server

1086
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,170
system is is broken we know this and

1087
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,720
it's it's not working it's it's able to

1088
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,600
solve this technically but not in a

1089
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,510
socialist social democracy way that we

1090
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,280
can actually ethically and there was a

1091
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,240
good conversation about this yesterday

1092
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,030
be ok with how would this is solved I

1093
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,400
think this is the major major change is

1094
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,930
how we approach handling of information

1095
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,940
in in this

1096
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,040
we have like if you could keep this

1097
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,860
short that we grate the toilet and see

1098
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,140
if you could repeat a question oh hi I

1099
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,720
was just wondering if you are aware or

1100
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,410
you're in connection we with web torrent

1101
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,260
browser project which is a web browser

1102
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,110
specifically for well websites of a

1103
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,770
torrent and the list project wait one

1104
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,190
second the list project which is where

1105
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,790
you page through the world of blockchain

1106
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,560
exchange to run applications I'm aware

1107
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,610
of the web Tron I didn't quite

1108
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,910
understand the second one but liske ysk

1109
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,040
there's a lot of in the blockchain

1110
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,750
sphere especially there's a lot of

1111
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,660
interesting projects on this thank you

1112
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,370
I'm going to look that one up there's

1113
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,450
another question right behind you

1114
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,050
thank you for the talk can you pixie

1115
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,210
boot an operating system is so off the

1116
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:24,060
safe Network you can yes really cool

1117
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,730
there's there's all the air so there are

1118
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,600
all various totally up for that so right

1119
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,040
right now we're running an alpha but one

1120
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,350
of the first things I want to do once we

1121
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,550
have more left

1122
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,350
stable Network is basically clone

1123
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,720
Wikipedia so that everybody can access

1124
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,490
it without anyone else knowing yeah

1125
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:50,399
definitely all of the operating system

1126
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,080
thanks for the talk indeed there are

1127
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,350
more similar projects to make this

1128
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,810
decentralized encrypted peer-to-peer

1129
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,140
network it's any option of federating

1130
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:11,200
with different projects I think there is

1131
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,740
to degree like IP LD the ipfs linked

1132
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,930
data protocol even contains in its

1133
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,060
specification the idea that you would

1134
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,200
tell me where this hash is there's I

1135
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,630
think in the xor namespace we're still

1136
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,780
very early in the stages of how we

1137
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,810
actually do this aside from us theorems

1138
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,150
swarm is the only implementation

1139
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,650
actually existing trying to achieve that

1140
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,780
and addressing works differently in

1141
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:42,550
those so I'm not sure if addressing

1142
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,770
across networks is compatible all the

1143
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,820
time

1144
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,090
and we're not stable enough to even know

1145
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,560
if what we're currently doing is is

1146
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,900
something worth keeping around so I I do

1147
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,700
think it's possible I do think it's an

1148
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,600
interesting interesting idea and but

1149
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,560
there I don't think there have been

1150
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,930
attempts made yet the next question

1151
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:12,220
thanks it's the company behind this

1152
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,450
project how is this sorry the the

1153
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,920
company behind the project how is this

1154
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,320
structure Chen can we expect features

1155
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,440
which are for paying users

1156
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,970
okay so the the company structure is

1157
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,310
that we have a company called made safe

1158
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,400
that was founded by one person ten years

1159
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,990
ago which had this idea to get rid of

1160
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,030
the server and we've been developing

1161
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,670
stuff since but the idea of the network

1162
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,100
is that from these safe coins that are

1163
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,750
created as I think it's ten percent it's

1164
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,160
supposed to be designated for the core

1165
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,000
development we haven't figured out yet

1166
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,100
even how the currency works but the idea

1167
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,210
is that this currency then through the

1168
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,880
usage of the network would be given to

1169
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,670
the developers to continue working on it

1170
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,800
and made safe considers itself one of

1171
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,470
the companies that as it has many of the

1172
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,120
core developers currently on payroll

1173
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,830
would get a lot of these coins but

1174
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,570
hopefully won't be the only one so the

1175
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,060
idea is from the from the get-go that

1176
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,100
other developers once we have this in

1177
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,720
place are in push to incentivize to also

1178
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,880
join this and become independent and

1179
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,520
it's not controlled by one company it's

1180
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,120
too massive and important alpha project

1181
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,410
to have this under control of one

1182
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,710
potentially problematic legal thing

1183
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,120
which is the other thing it's gonna be

1184
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,480
mates have limited in Scotland and

1185
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,270
brexit and their Snooper charter are

1186
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:48,020
kind of worrying this so one idea is to

1187
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,950
have more more entities involved thank

1188
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,630
you the last question and then okay hi

1189
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,910
given that there's so many companies

1190
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,800
nowadays who are storing literally

1191
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,290
terabytes or terabytes petabytes Zeta

1192
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,720
bytes of data is it your expectation

1193
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,000
that under this type of architecture

1194
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,800
that all of that data would be spread

1195
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,210
out over the internet that my house

1196
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,480
would somehow have 150 terabytes so my

1197
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,040
neighbor would have 150 terabytes and

1198
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,240
somehow that would have all of our

1199
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,180
photos and videos everywhere or their

1200
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,440
data warehouses in your architecture

1201
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,750
somewhere that I'm not seeing no data

1202
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,460
warehousing is definitely in the

1203
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,440
architecture like you can run a vault on

1204
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,950
any AWS instance for example and

1205
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,540
considering that depending on how much

1206
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,490
resources are in the network it might

1207
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,339
actually be more interesting for some

1208
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,479
like AWS or other big data centers to

1209
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:41,769
instead of renting the machine to you

1210
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:44,200
renting it by running a vault to that

1211
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,640
network and so they would get that money

1212
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,289
this is almost the theoretical of course

1213
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:52,989
but the idea is that when we say

1214
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:55,359
peer-to-peer it could be any size of

1215
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,160
storage in the end we have some minimum

1216
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,479
requirements to make sure that the

1217
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:01,269
network is stable and and uptime is okay

1218
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:06,579
but until until that point you can just

1219
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,829
run it on AWS or any other on a other

1220
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,910
server and use all of that storage up

1221
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,930
okay thank you very much if you have

1222
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,219
more question we're gonna discuss stuff

1223
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,960
I'm gonna go over there thank you

1224
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:25,110
[Applause]
