1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,510
okay

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,930
next up we have Josh Triplett and just

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,369
Kumar's alright so we'd like to talk to

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,220
you a little bit about licensing open

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,710
hardware as opposed to just as open

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,369
software so I'm Josh Triplett this is

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,730
Jessica Mars we're gonna and I want to

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,840
start off with some of the standard

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,020
disclaimers I am NOT a lawyer jessica is

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,649
a lawyer but is not your lawyer and

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,120
neither of us are speaking for any

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,760
company organization or any other entity

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,920
that we may be a part of we will assume

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,449
if you ask questions you're not either

15
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,139
this is not legal advice our experience

16
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:49,289
is primarily with US law so that is

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,420
where our citations are many of the

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,949
things we're mentioning and talking

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,069
about do apply globally or to numerous

20
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,100
countries based off of various treaties

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,899
but we would certainly welcome any

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,209
Corrections or commentary from people

23
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,890
experienced with the International

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,900
equivalents or other related law and

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,680
please do feel free if you've got an

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,660
urgent question or commentary to make

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,070
this more interactive and have a

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,170
discussion otherwise feel free to ask

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,530
questions at the end as well so as I

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,440
said I'm not a lawyer my primary day job

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,000
is that I'm a software architect so

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,470
let's talk about software architecture

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,110
first so there's a lot of ways you could

34
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,410
put software together you can put source

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,140
code into the same source file you could

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,450
link object files or libraries together

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,750
from multiple object files or multiple

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,600
separate libraries shared or static you

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,510
could fork an exec a process you could

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,790
create multiple independent servers

41
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,890
communicate via remote procedure call

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,470
communicate via sockets of some kind

43
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,450
even over a network you could have a

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,280
shared memory architecture between

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,860
multiple processes you could have some

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,490
standardized API is for talking between

47
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,990
multiple programs for which multiple

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,140
implementations exist and one

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,940
interesting distinction here is that

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,550
these various distinctions don't matter

51
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,769
massively from a legal point of view if

52
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,659
you're using permissive licensing if

53
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,579
you're using a license that says do

54
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,540
whatever you want

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,219
door do whatever you want as long as you

56
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,250
give me credit for it then it doesn't

57
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,140
really matter how you put your software

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,060
together you can do whatever you want

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,670
but where those distinctions start

60
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,590
getting interesting is when you start

61
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,409
using copyleft licenses in that case

62
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,019
there is an intent that you're trying to

63
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,659
provide of saying this is the scope that

64
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,359
I consider this license to extend to and

65
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,389
there are various licenses that extend

66
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,430
that scope to varying degrees on a

67
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,859
spectrum you've got the LGPL which

68
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,069
extends it to the the case of linking

69
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,439
multiple objects together but allows

70
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,349
some more flexibility and more free

71
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,180
passes if you're linking dynamic

72
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,609
libraries you've got the GPL that

73
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,829
extends through dynamic libraries and up

74
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,400
to some other boundary you know

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,169
details to be determined see court law

76
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,049
see various courts in the future you've

77
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,269
got the a GPL which will extend that out

78
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,419
through servers of various kinds and the

79
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,250
point is not to say this is where the

80
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,290
boundary should be drawn it's to say

81
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,909
there are many interesting points you

82
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,769
can draw that boundary on based off of

83
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,919
your goal and your intent one point I

84
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,930
want to make here is we're not claiming

85
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,959
in this talk to have all the answers our

86
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,879
hope is that we have almost all of the

87
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,819
right questions and then some plausible

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,470
set of answers that we can talk to you

89
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,949
about

90
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,650
so that's software architecture and

91
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,959
software copyleft and that's been you

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,209
know while it may not be perfectly

93
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,819
explored in case law at this point it is

94
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,260
certainly something that has been well

95
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,720
trodden by many a software engineer and

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,319
lawyer for the last several decades so

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,970
let's talk a little bit about hardware

98
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,280
architecture and how that leads into

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,049
open hardware so there are many

100
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,819
different ways you could put Hardware

101
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,439
together as well and many different

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,750
forms of hardware you could have some

103
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,209
physical object that you have blueprints

104
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,340
for this is the Voyager probe for

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,639
example you could have circuits on an

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,190
integrated circuit the individual pieces

107
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,729
of the chip that you know fit together

108
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,580
to make one integrated circuit this is

109
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,849
the 486 for example you could have many

110
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,249
components on a system on chip that

111
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:35,759
have multiple integrated components that

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,789
each go to may go together on the same

113
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,719
physical chip of manufacturer but at the

114
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,879
same time are in some ways somewhat

115
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,219
independent pieces put together so

116
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:51,089
here's a relatively new SOC this is a

117
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:54,539
set of Haswell chips you you could have

118
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,089
a set of almost software like

119
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,219
descriptions of hardware in the form of

120
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,029
an FPGA

121
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,179
that the FPGA itself is hardware and it

122
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:06,029
is in a way interpreting that bit stream

123
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,689
to implement hardware in a soft way you

124
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,149
can glue chips together on a board via

125
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:15,360
pins via some printed circuit board you

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,559
can have the printed circuit board

127
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,659
itself that's designed to connect many

128
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,089
components and connectors together or

129
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,699
you can wire those boards together via

130
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,519
any number of connectors from PCI to USB

131
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,169
and you know on top of the ways that you

132
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,299
could put Hardware together there are

133
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,369
many different forms of hardware as well

134
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:40,349
so just like you can compile a piece of

135
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,629
source code to get a binary you could

136
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,679
have a CAD STL file that you then turn

137
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,619
into a physical object via 3d printer or

138
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,679
some injection molding or similar you

139
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,469
could have a schematic for a chip that

140
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,110
gives you the actual circuitry of the

141
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,119
chip but not exactly how its laid out

142
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,569
you could do a partially compiling and

143
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,509
partially manual process to turn that

144
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,169
into laid out masks for a semiconductor

145
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,329
and then turn that into a physical chip

146
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,639
this is the original four thousand four

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,610
integrated circuit you could again have

148
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,089
an FPGA bitstream and then put it on to

149
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,309
an actual programmed FPGA and ship that

150
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,339
FPGA in a product you can have a PCB

151
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,669
layout in various forms and stages that

152
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,699
then becomes a physical PCB and so

153
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,559
that's an interesting distinction that

154
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,019
it goes beyond the notion of a compiled

155
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,959
binary for software because it's not

156
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,239
just that you have a compiled binary you

157
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,819
have a physical object some of the laws

158
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:45,380
apply

159
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,710
differently and again all of these

160
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,380
things are relatively easy to talk about

161
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,550
when you're dealing with permissive

162
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,170
licensing if you're saying do whatever

163
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,410
you want then the details don't really

164
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,840
matter and most of the efforts going on

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,360
around open hardware right now are based

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,210
on permissive licensing so I think where

167
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,130
this gets particularly interesting again

168
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,740
is when you start talking about copyleft

169
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,320
and at that point we really have to

170
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,750
start talking about intent what is your

171
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,320
goal in trying to use copyleft for

172
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,690
hardware what are you trying to enable

173
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,120
what would you like people to be able to

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,210
do and we can talk about various

175
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,220
boundaries you might want to draw or

176
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,730
various pieces that you would say well

177
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,490
going up to this point we would say

178
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,560
copyleft extends but I would say there's

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,690
a few people in the room that would say

180
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,190
that just because you have a copyleft

181
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,860
license on a board that you should have

182
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,080
to free whatever is on the other end of

183
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,480
a USB connection but on the other hand

184
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,640
if you have two circuits on the in the

185
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,920
same integrated circuit manufactured

186
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,890
with the same mask on the that might

187
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,200
reasonably have a copyleft license

188
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,480
extend that far and somewhere between

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,420
there there's a line or even a set of

190
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,550
lines for different licenses that we

191
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,270
might reasonably agree on so in addition

192
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,550
to those intense then there's the

193
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,320
question of how do we implement that

194
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,620
with software we can use copyright as

195
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,930
the exclusive right that backs our

196
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,440
licenses that allows us to then choose

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,690
what subset of those rights we license

198
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,640
and under what condition ille grande of

199
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,160
permission so with Hardware the

200
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,660
situation gets a little bit more

201
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,580
complicated and more interesting and

202
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,169
with that I'd like to hand it over to

203
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,570
Jessica to discuss the legal

204
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,260
implementation of that thank you no

205
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,000
actually I need that this will be a

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,370
challenge I have two devices in my hands

207
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,970
at the same time so hopefully as Josh

208
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,580
was talking the wheels were turning in

209
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,380
your mind you were thinking perhaps of

210
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,180
parallels between software and hardware

211
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,890
are there actually any hardware

212
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,899
designers or developers in the eyes

213
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,300
awesome actually that's kind of

214
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,269
terrifying because I'm probably going to

215
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,839
get this wrong as Josh mentioned not my

216
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,699
day job but anyway since we have

217
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,949
experience in software and in in

218
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,110
licensing we sort of naturally look at

219
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,119
the licenses that we know and love and

220
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,679
that our OSI approved and think how can

221
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,010
we apply them to to hardware and

222
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,589
[Music]

223
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,600
obviously permissive licenses are easy

224
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,610
as Josh said if you don't really have to

225
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,529
worry about anything except just giving

226
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,139
somebody attribution or credit you know

227
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,649
no problem copyleft is much more

228
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,679
interesting and non-trivial because you

229
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,619
have to think of things like boundaries

230
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,179
and boundaries and hardware are much

231
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,399
different than they are in in software

232
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,889
there are some close parallels like Josh

233
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,679
was saying the perhaps two circuits or

234
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,199
two cores on the same die that are on a

235
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,329
board connected to some other thing

236
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,220
there's there's boundaries that are

237
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,079
really far away sort of easy to see in

238
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,829
boundaries that are fuzzier so you need

239
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:08,959
something like copyleft I think in order

240
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,269
to sorry I'm gonna go over here we need

241
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,029
something like copy left in order to

242
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,759
open hardware and I'm sorry that was a

243
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,050
bad segue I said I had to slide up

244
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,290
earlier everyone here familiar with

245
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,870
copyleft goals right most important is

246
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,519
probably enabling the study of the

247
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,629
design in the preferred format for

248
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,879
making modifications to design people

249
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,290
need to be able to modify and distribute

250
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,319
what they modify the person who

251
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,899
originally came up with the design the

252
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,459
license or should have all the same

253
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,959
rights afforded to them that the

254
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,549
licensee has and so that's something

255
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,120
that gets protected or is ensured by

256
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,529
making derivative is available under the

257
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,220
same license not one of the official

258
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,139
four freedoms but one that we've talked

259
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,209
about earlier today is making sure that

260
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,309
recognition or attribution of the

261
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,319
creative origin of a design happens and

262
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,600
then of course ultimate goal by having

263
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,370
something under a copyleft regime is to

264
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,480
expand the size of the open common

265
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,600
I think there's a couple of additional

266
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,560
considerations that we want to think of

267
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,590
for hardware anyway hardware

268
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,050
specifically and those should be that

269
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,590
any any necessary components that you

270
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,110
aren't going to build yourself or so non

271
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,720
self manufactured things should be

272
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,390
standard or readily available so nothing

273
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,450
made of unobtainium or that's available

274
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,160
in the in minimum purchased quantities

275
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
of a hundred thousand so I would say

276
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,290
those would be I am goals for for open

277
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,570
hardware Josh was talking also before

278
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,630
about how exactly we make these things

279
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,470
work and we know that we use copyright

280
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,040
for software copyright under US law

281
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,140
actually under all's grants the creators

282
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,060
certain exclusive rights and the fact

283
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,710
that people have exclusive rights mean

284
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,000
that they then have something that they

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,870
can choose to license with others so a

286
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,330
really quick review because I know even

287
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,790
though I don't know how many people are

288
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,590
lawyers in the audience fewer than the

289
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,920
hardware developers but okay so even so

290
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,120
most of you guys probably know this

291
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,770
stuff too but in the interest of

292
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,240
completeness I'm going to talk about

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,350
each of these sources of exclusive

294
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,910
rights for authors and creators so

295
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,790
copyright patent masks work which might

296
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,140
be one that's kind of new to folks and

297
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,680
Trademark so copyright just again is a

298
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,830
refresher there's five exclusive rights

299
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,120
three of them are probably most

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,790
important for both software and hardware

301
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,290
so that's reproducing the work

302
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,180
distributing copies of the work or

303
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,280
creating derivative works based on the

304
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,830
work subject matter for copyright

305
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,770
there's a whole lot but really two are

306
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,200
going to be important for hardware and

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,820
those are literary works and that's

308
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,410
probably are primarily going to be

309
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,270
important for the software that is going

310
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,650
to enable hardware and by the way I'm

311
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,470
sorry assumption that everyone was

312
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,030
thinking that I was I'm talking about

313
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,650
electronic hardware I'm not talking

314
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,930
about just a plain physical object that

315
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,630
doesn't have any circuits in it literary

316
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,670
works and the pictorial graphic and

317
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,410
sculptural works and then just for

318
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,060
completeness in case anybody who's

319
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,890
interested in what the entire scope of

320
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,170
u.s. copyright law covers I listed the

321
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,960
other so

322
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,310
check matter the next source of

323
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,570
exclusive rights for creators is patent

324
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,310
patent law and that gives inventors the

325
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,920
exclusive rights to do four things make

326
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,920
use sell or import the inventions and

327
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,770
there's four areas of subject matter

328
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,430
under patent law most likely thinking

329
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,530
about hardware machine and manufacture

330
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,410
are going to be the applicable ones but

331
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,780
process and composition conceivably

332
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,900
could also have to do with hardware so

333
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,480
you might wonder you know open open

334
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,510
patent patent excludes people why would

335
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,220
you possibly want to patent something

336
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,550
that you want to open which is a

337
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,280
legitimate question and the reason that

338
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,020
I can think if you didn't already have a

339
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,640
patent the reason why you might want to

340
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,460
go get one is so that assuming that you

341
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,080
had a hardware design that you had

342
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,720
licensed under a copyleft terms if

343
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,660
someone wasn't fulfilling the terms the

344
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,040
copyleft terms of that license and you

345
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,540
terminated their license you could still

346
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,750
have rights under your patent to go

347
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,200
after them for some sort of damages but

348
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,750
patents again sort of contrary to free

349
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,460
and open they're also expensive and

350
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,860
time-consuming to get and they only last

351
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,390
for twenty years but always not losses

352
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,770
so it's not it's not like patents are

353
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,580
totally useless

354
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,620
you could file for a patent and then

355
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,010
never get one or even not not actually

356
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,510
filing for a patent just publishing your

357
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,360
design can serve an important purpose in

358
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,430
terms of keeping hardware free also and

359
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,070
so that's you know the idea of defensive

360
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,810
publishing or putting something out

361
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,060
there and making it prior art and I put

362
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,010
a little plug down in the bottom corner

363
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,480
my slide here there's actually a

364
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,240
presentation tomorrow from the what are

365
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,840
they called the open patent project

366
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,550
excuse me talking specifically about

367
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,610
this subject so I would definitely check

368
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,340
that out if you're interested I know I'm

369
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,980
going to be there but patents don't make

370
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,600
a ton of sense but again have to talk

371
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,610
about them in the context of exclusive

372
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,470
rights so masks works are interesting

373
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,770
and mask works actually came into being

374
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,370
in nineteen

375
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,470
for because of the semiconductor chip

376
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,779
Protection Act which international

377
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,850
internationally semiconductor chips are

378
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,220
protected under something that's called

379
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,560
trips and what the acronym stands for

380
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:56,200
right now is eluding me but so close yes

381
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,080
okay there's an S there too but anyway

382
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,270
came came into being to protect ships

383
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,460
and it's sort of a hybrid between

384
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,410
copyright and patent it doesn't give you

385
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,210
all of the same exclusive rights of

386
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,260
either one of it I was but the important

387
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,720
ones are that you can reproduce the mask

388
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,390
work and import or distribute a

389
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,100
semiconductor chip in which the masks

390
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,350
work is embodied so it's kind of

391
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,600
interesting the masks work doesn't give

392
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,190
you any exclusive rights until it

393
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,080
becomes embodied in the chip but then

394
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,140
once it does you have the rights to keep

395
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,350
other people from basically cloning your

396
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,500
product interestingly you might have

397
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,020
noticed that the there's no language

398
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,170
about derivative works they're mask

399
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,060
works do not give you the exclusive

400
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,120
right to create derivative works and

401
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,160
reverse engineering is under is allowed

402
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,670
underneath the CPA so it's conceivable

403
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,760
that someone could you know take a chip

404
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,070
that I bailed and reverse-engineer it or

405
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,020
study it make significant modifications

406
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,670
to it and then build you know their own

407
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,369
and ship it and sell it but the one

408
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,619
thing or one of the things that stands

409
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,689
in the way of that is actually making

410
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,250
ships is really expensive and really

411
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,520
hard so I think at the time that this

412
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,069
law came out or that this was enacted it

413
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,109
was a bigger deal I think maybe it would

414
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,790
only cost like maybe 50 million dollars

415
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,069
to reverse engineer and make a chip but

416
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,260
I think that figure has grown

417
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,900
exponentially since then and subject

418
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,270
matter again a mask work is something

419
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,950
that's fixed in a semiconductor chip

420
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,300
that's the only thing that mask quarks

421
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,809
applied to

422
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,309
and last but not least trademark

423
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,090
trademark the exclusive rights

424
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,979
associated with that are the exclusive

425
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,729
rights to use a mark and a corollary to

426
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,919
that then is the ability to prevent the

427
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,809
use of that mark or a confusingly

428
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,869
similar mark by another party subject

429
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:58,539
matter for trademarks word name symbol

430
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,879
or any device used to identify product

431
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,669
the thing about trademark as opposed to

432
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,070
the other three sources of exclusive

433
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,509
rights that I just talked about this is

434
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,950
the only one that I don't think is a

435
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,859
really good candidate for opening and

436
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:15,099
the reason for that is that trademark is

437
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,769
it's associated with you your brand and

438
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,470
your identity so you don't want people

439
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,599
to be sticking you know your trademark

440
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,789
on a product that doesn't live up to

441
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,979
your quality standards but it also

442
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,539
indicates a single source of origin

443
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,320
which is not really consistent with the

444
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,149
whole principle of open development

445
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,419
right which is the sort of decentralized

446
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,330
and multiplayer multi party model but I

447
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,559
felt it would have been remiss if I

448
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,940
didn't talk about trademark at least a

449
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,950
little bit so there it is that's the

450
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,549
last I'm going to talk about it so now

451
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,099
that we have our foundation or we've

452
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,899
been reminded of the sources of our

453
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,330
exclusive rights in various objects

454
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,009
let's talk about hardware and forms

455
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:04,210
again so actually one second for those

456
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,080
of you who aren't hardware engineers the

457
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,940
difference between developing software

458
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,070
and developing hardware the biggest

459
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,659
difference seems to me and again this is

460
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,690
me as a layperson is that there are a

461
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,239
lot of different steps involved in

462
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,029
creating hardware and those steps

463
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,549
interestingly different different tools

464
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,979
are used different parts along the

465
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,169
journey and different exclusive rights

466
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,580
can attach at different places and to me

467
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,869
that's interesting from a legal

468
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,519
perspective because potentially you can

469
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,259
put different licenses on things at

470
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,049
different parts and depending on where

471
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,369
in the stream you're combining things

472
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:44,669
there may be different effects happening

473
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,099
so now I can talk about printed circuit

474
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,570
boards PCBs I think are really good

475
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,880
of what I was talking about where there

476
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,230
are these different steps that have

477
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,060
different artifacts that get created

478
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,670
that are potentially protected by

479
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,380
different exclusive rights at different

480
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,260
stages in the process so you start out

481
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,140
with your schematic capture which is

482
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,880
basically just representing the logical

483
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,060
design of the circuit can't copyright or

484
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,160
can't protect a circuit that's it just

485
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,010
it is as fact but the the graphical

486
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,990
representation that I've put out here is

487
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,690
something that could be protected by

488
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,420
copyright the output of this schematic

489
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,760
capture process there's I guess usually

490
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
three one would be a proprietary design

491
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,180
file another would be this graphic so

492
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,770
something that's usually like in a PDF

493
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,370
or JPEG format a visual representation

494
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,080
of the circuit and then netlist and

495
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,290
component information files the

496
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,690
proprietary file the design file and the

497
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,610
diagram are like I said they're

498
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,820
protectable as expressive works the

499
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,640
netlist and the component information

500
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,500
probably aren't protectable because

501
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,020
they're so functional but interestingly

502
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,850
the netlist and the component

503
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,790
information are the important wait does

504
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,200
this have yes the pointer okay

505
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,610
those become the input to the second

506
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,440
part in the PCB process which is the

507
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,300
layout where the designer is actually

508
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,440
coming up with the physical

509
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,750
implementation of how the circuits are

510
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,930
going to work and it's not really dark

511
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,250
in this room so you can't really see how

512
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,990
complex it is but it's it's really

513
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,230
beautiful

514
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,710
pretty no argument I think that a

515
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,630
certain degree of artistic skill and

516
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,050
creativity is required to place you know

517
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,460
routes and figure out where components

518
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,540
are going to go the output of the layout

519
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,000
process are a series of files called

520
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,510
Gerber files and what they represent

521
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,590
most definitely the fruits of that

522
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,470
creative and artistic labor are

523
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,540
protectable by a copyright and since

524
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,640
copyright gives us exclusive rights that

525
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,110
means you could license them under a

526
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,120
copyleft regime or any other open

527
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,500
licensing regime of your choice

528
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,210
and then last but not least those Gerber

529
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,870
files get fed into the tooling at PCB

530
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,269
manufacturing house and they make your

531
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,549
PCB you have this manufactured board

532
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,440
that embodies the design the actual

533
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,899
board itself now it's no longer

534
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,879
protected by anything although I suppose

535
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,850
if it was sculptural or really

536
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,039
expressive in its shape it might qualify

537
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,870
for protection under the pictorial

538
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,240
graphic or sculptural works but probably

539
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,570
not basically the only thing at this

540
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,159
point that would be eligible for any

541
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,779
sort of exclusive rights would be any

542
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,340
designs that you had screened on the

543
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,970
surface of the of the board but anyway

544
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,559
PCB an example of the multiple stages

545
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,259
the different artifacts that get

546
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,690
produced and in this case they're

547
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,370
actually all protected by copyright but

548
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,210
examples of the different exclusive

549
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,470
rights that could attach at different

550
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,600
points so silicon then is interesting

551
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,309
we'll start with talking about mask

552
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:08,370
works over here on the left dang it left

553
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,600
I had there we go a picture of a mask

554
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,940
work remember mask works don't actually

555
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,580
have any masks don't have any protection

556
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,169
under that mask work

557
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,720
law until they actually become fixed

558
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,220
over and the piece of silicon which you

559
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,669
see on the right but over here just when

560
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,039
it's existing is emit a mask this could

561
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,299
be protected under copyright right and

562
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,700
then over here on the right again final

563
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,870
product here you get the mask work

564
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,940
kicking in and it's protectable under

565
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,799
the SCPA provisions but before a mask

566
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,759
work even exists before you start to

567
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,149
build the masks you start out with the

568
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:58,590
design of the chip and one of the things

569
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,919
that I think is testament to how

570
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:03,600
difficult and time-consuming it is to

571
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
produce or to design a semiconductor

572
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,580
chip is the fact that what has become

573
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,950
really a large industry in and of itself

574
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,129
in the tech industry is the licensing of

575
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:14,720
core

576
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,870
I pee course which are usually broken

577
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,850
into it or referred to as either being

578
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,270
hard or soft but these are designs that

579
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,120
are made by third party vendors or

580
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,010
there's you know some companies all they

581
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,049
do is Korres other companies do a

582
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:32,360
variety of things but the idea is that

583
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,299
they are pre-configured or pre-designed

584
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,520
blocks of IP that can be dropped into

585
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,280
designs thus enabling people to design

586
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,600
more quickly you see up here oh dang it

587
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,309
I've keep wanting to push the other

588
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,820
thing on the upper left this is a

589
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,110
drawing of what's supposed to be a

590
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,840
system on a chip and you can see very

591
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,780
distinct blocks in here those are coarse

592
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,090
these are supposed to representing hard

593
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,950
coarse and the things that's interesting

594
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,409
to me anyway about course and whether

595
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:07,220
they're hard or soft is well they they

596
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,230
affect the way that the licenses might

597
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,120
work on them when you use them in a

598
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,429
design the hard cores again you can see

599
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,360
how they're very distinct if you have a

600
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,429
hard core IP block that you basically

601
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:24,890
drop into a design and you interface

602
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,720
with the rest of the design using

603
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,270
standard interfaces to communicate then

604
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,419
it stays pretty discreet stays by itself

605
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,600
if you had a copyleft license on that IP

606
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,340
core it wouldn't be extending the

607
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,370
copyright sorry the copyleft terms to

608
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,280
the rest of the course on your silicon

609
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,490
but what if you had a hard core they put

610
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,650
into your design and it turns out that

611
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,200
you couldn't use standard interfaces in

612
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,130
your design you had to make

613
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,770
modifications in order to make that core

614
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,830
work well then those modified interfaces

615
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,809
would probably become a derivative work

616
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,620
of the copyleft core and then you would

617
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,929
have copyleft obligations spreading

618
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,630
beyond that core and going at least to

619
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,669
the interface that you had to do so

620
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,020
requiring you to make the sources

621
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,850
available for that soft course on the

622
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,240
other hand are well they're more like

623
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,580
software they're malleable they're in an

624
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,399
editable format and down here I've got a

625
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,130
picture the same picture Josh had of an

626
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,960
you can see there's definitely some

627
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,570
hardcore logic blocks in here but then

628
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,240
there's a whole bunch of other area that

629
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,510
is more tightly synthesized there's been

630
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,550
a lot more integration that happens when

631
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,070
you're using soft cars and engineers

632
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,580
correct me if I have this wrong but the

633
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,530
the nature of the soft IP because you're

634
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,480
getting it in HDL you're getting it in

635
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,790
the the human readable form describing

636
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,760
the circuit is that actually it's going

637
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,860
to influence the design the rest of the

638
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,990
design and the other design the rest of

639
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,370
the design is going to influence it

640
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,270
there's sort of this interplay which if

641
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,920
you think about it in software terms

642
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,350
it's it's very much like a commingling

643
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,750
or what we say it's not even linking

644
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,520
it's like taking snippets and merging

645
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,740
things together so I think if you're

646
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,630
using a soft IP core you're almost

647
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,230
guaranteed to have a derivative work so

648
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,170
again you could have a spread of

649
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,179
copyleft you could open up your design

650
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,730
way big if you didn't want to have your

651
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,210
design open but you wanted to use a soft

652
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,460
IP core what you might do is take the

653
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,590
soft IP core and try to harden it up

654
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,630
before you put it in your design I guess

655
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,770
that would be one way that you could

656
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,559
sort of try to minimize the boundary

657
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,340
creep or the boundary encroachment but

658
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,179
anyway those are the differences between

659
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,730
hard and soft IP as I understand them

660
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,660
and I just thought that was really

661
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,110
interesting it's worth mentioning as

662
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,120
well that this is another place where

663
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,610
your intent matters such that it's

664
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,570
reasonable to ask as we develop more

665
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,190
understanding of how to apply copyleft

666
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,860
to open Hardware where we want our

667
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,320
licenses to extend we may reasonably

668
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,890
want Hardware equivalents of the LGPL as

669
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,840
well as Hardware equivalents of the GPL

670
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,910
with you know tighter and looser

671
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,640
boundaries for how far they extend and

672
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,130
that would play nicely into this as well

673
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,120
sorry I didn't think that I forgot to

674
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,370
mention and this is sort of unfortunate

675
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,420
that you reminded me we were talking

676
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,059
about intent all of my great intent to

677
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,309
have an open design is going to be for

678
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,490
naught or may be for naught at the end

679
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,640
here

680
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,630
when I get down to actually finishing up

681
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,190
my design using my EDA tools all of the

682
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,890
tools have proprietary libraries in them

683
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,080
so when I combine whether they're hard

684
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,330
or soft IP cords that I licensed whether

685
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,710
it's you know I did the full design

686
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,500
myself from scratch when it comes time

687
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,640
to combining them with the libraries

688
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,160
from my EDA tools I may very well end up

689
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,040
with a derived work that now is going to

690
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,420
have license compatibility issues

691
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,280
because like I said all of those EDA

692
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
libraries are under proprietary licenses

693
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,570
so have a couple of options I could

694
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,700
choose to license or you know make my

695
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,230
course available under a permissive

696
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,790
license because that makes things easy

697
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,760
or maybe I could make them under a weak

698
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,620
copyleft license or another possibility

699
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,190
not sure if we can actually take this as

700
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,540
gospel but what if we had a okay what if

701
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,530
what if we had a system

702
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,210
the equivalent of a system library

703
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,030
exception for course so a core library

704
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,340
exception I'm not sure if you could read

705
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,410
the gplv3 as enabling that but if you

706
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,540
could that would be great and just by

707
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,180
the way the gplv3 family of licenses is

708
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,370
the only are the only OSI approved

709
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,410
licenses that mention asked works in

710
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,090
them which I thought was interesting so

711
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,320
they were kind of thinking I had two

712
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,400
Hardware related to the library problem

713
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,040
that I mentioned for my soft and hard IP

714
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,470
cores run into a similar problem with

715
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,380
the FPGA down below and so we've got the

716
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,610
Giza silicon that's built over here you

717
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,940
got a program with a bit stream there

718
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,220
there is no open tooling from any of the

719
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,030
major FPGA vendors that to enable the

720
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,910
the creation of a bit stream to put into

721
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,770
the FPGA so once again I could have done

722
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,020
all of my other design have it be opened

723
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,970
but then when I okay you're gonna

724
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,360
correct me

725
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:50,220
yes yes well and not are you from the

726
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,160
ice storm project okay but you know

727
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,930
about it no no okay so so here's a

728
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,480
problem so so again I can't program my

729
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,330
my my FPGA without getting in trouble so

730
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,620
really the best that you could possibly

731
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,210
do I think if you are coming up with the

732
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,650
design for a for an FPGA would be to

733
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,070
make your HDL designs available under an

734
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,840
open license and then provide

735
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,630
instructions for your users how they

736
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,860
could create the rest of the design

737
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,210
files and how they can generate the

738
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,980
bitstream although that still doesn't

739
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,240
solve the problem for them it's just

740
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,670
moved it over to the right now they're

741
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,990
the ones who are going to be creating

742
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,210
the thing that has the proprietary

743
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,780
libraries mixed with the open with the

744
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,390
open license design I suspect that the

745
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,080
absence of or lack of clarity around

746
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,450
whether we have a core library exception

747
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,000
is why most of the cores that you see

748
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,490
available under open licenses are either

749
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,490
permissive or LGPL because I think

750
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,830
either of those licensing schemes sort

751
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,170
of gets around the problem and yes okay

752
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,630
so open hardware there is actually an

753
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,170
opened FPGA the ice storm project guys

754
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,970
reverse engineered that lattice ice 40

755
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,910
FPGAs so they've figured out how to do

756
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,140
the bit stream and this is actually a

757
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,520
picture of something called my storm

758
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,520
which a guy named Alan wood created

759
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,900
fully open piece of hardware you can see

760
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,270
the open hardware that open Hardware

761
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,940
logo on it so if you were so inclined

762
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,160
you could get all the get the schematics

763
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,400
get the Gerber's get your files over to

764
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,130
your PCB house build your PCB order your

765
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,320
lattice semiconductor for what like what

766
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,500
15 dollars or something and then you can

767
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,710
you can program it know the bit stream

768
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,960
that magical part magical last part

769
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,390
isn't open not on Intel sorry but that's

770
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,650
a great question and we asked our

771
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,380
friends in the program will solutions

772
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,850
group hey would you open the bit stream

773
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,830
so we could do that but no

774
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,710
even lattice hasn't opened it right it's

775
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,090
the guys at ice storm who reverse

776
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,380
engineered it because again reverse

777
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,990
engineering is allowed under the SCPA

778
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,789
but no no vendor has opened their

779
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,279
bitstream if anyone wants to volunteer

780
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,399
to reverse engineer on Terra FPGA or

781
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,809
Xilinx that's that would be awesome

782
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,440
sorry so back back to my hardware design

783
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,179
an enclosure might be another thing that

784
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,610
you have in your your hardware design so

785
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,880
an original design created in a CAD tool

786
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,590
or it could be something like a scan of

787
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,200
an existing object whether or not your

788
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
enclosure or your physical thing is

789
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,010
going to be able to be protected in any

790
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,600
way or whether your design files

791
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,950
representing the object are going to be

792
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,760
protected depends on a couple of things

793
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,980
how it was created again whether it was

794
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,690
native in the tool versus a scan of an

795
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,940
existing object I'll give you a hint if

796
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,169
it's native in the tool might be

797
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:51,360
protectable if you just do a scan of an

798
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,889
existing object not going to be

799
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:54,690
protected no matter how much skill or

800
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,029
creativity or art was required in making

801
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,029
that scan you haven't done enough

802
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:01,260
transformation to make it make it

803
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,820
eligible and then whether or not your

804
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,830
design file or the design itself are

805
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,270
going to be able to be protected by

806
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,099
anything they're going to be looking at

807
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,349
whether it's totally useful or creative

808
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,449
or you know where the balance is between

809
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,790
the two and courts would do a separable

810
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,530
ax T analysis to determine whether

811
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,000
copyright was going to apply to anything

812
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,489
in this case I think we would to say

813
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,480
that probably the the Intel logo is well

814
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,699
it's already protected by trademark but

815
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,379
my design file containing it would be

816
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,449
protectable and licensable under a

817
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,699
copyright just the interesting thing in

818
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,230
this example actually this isn't an

819
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,619
intel design this is some guy who is

820
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,260
infringing on the intel trademark i

821
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,790
thought it was nice and i'm not going to

822
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,679
report him because it's it's in support

823
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,520
of an Intel open hardware project so I'm

824
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,399
gonna wrap up briefly before I hand it

825
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,899
over to Josh I just wanted to talk about

826
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,489
the state of open hardware licensing

827
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,430
today

828
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,750
so what would happen intellectual

829
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,750
exercise if I had a chip today that was

830
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,780
built on an open design and I sold it or

831
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,760
I had a PCB that's built on open designs

832
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,860
and I manufacture the PCB and I sell it

833
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,630
what would happen or what does the

834
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,980
person who makes this stuff have to do

835
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,520
with it the answer is actually they

836
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,240
don't really have to do anything if

837
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,520
unless I license the design under either

838
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,280
the CERN or the tap or open hardware

839
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,580
licenses all of the other licenses that

840
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,590
are currently available or that are

841
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,590
designed for hardware plus the GPL v3

842
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,840
don't extend beyond the documentation

843
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,430
they don't extend beyond the digital

844
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,500
they stop at the hardware which i think

845
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,030
is unfortunate because i think the goal

846
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,310
of open hardware shouldn't be just that

847
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,690
you can build it but once you've

848
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,160
received the thing that's built you

849
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,540
should be able to understand how it was

850
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,810
built so I just have a little table here

851
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,120
summarizing you know the source field

852
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,530
delivery requirements which again I

853
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,300
think are really key whether or not the

854
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,100
physical Hardware gets treated like a

855
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,890
binary you know under the GPL is the

856
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,720
source required whether or not you can

857
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,430
use it for any purpose that's an

858
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,730
important one for some reason that the

859
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,650
tapper one doesn't have that as a as a

860
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,910
requirement but also having having the

861
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,920
license be compatible with copyleft

862
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,840
software licenses because again it's the

863
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,520
electronic device I'm imagining that I'm

864
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,200
going to have hardware and software

865
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,240
working together so over on the far

866
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,310
right I have my ideal hardware license

867
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,460
you see it has yes all over the place

868
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,840
but I also I'm going to make a specific

869
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,940
a core library exception so that I

870
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,760
solved my problem with the with the

871
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,020
course and yeah if anyone wants to take

872
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,550
a stand at writing that license that

873
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,840
would be awesome I'm actually the last

874
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,640
person who wants to encourage license

875
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,670
proliferation but I do think that to

876
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,740
make open hardware truly work we may

877
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,280
need a revised license now I'll turn it

878
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,990
back to Josh

879
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,200
so one key question you might reasonably

880
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,570
ask is why do we care about license

881
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,460
compatibility you know as mentioned on

882
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,530
the previous slide one of the issues is

883
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,869
that the the tapper open hardware

884
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,500
license for example explicitly has some

885
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,630
restrictions on what you can use the

886
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,750
resulting hardware for and as a result

887
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,880
it's a license that would not actually

888
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,190
qualify as an open source or free

889
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,770
software license that you know the

890
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,210
tapper folks would say well it's a

891
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,310
hardware license those don't apply but I

892
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,040
think that there's a key requirement

893
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,020
here that is becoming increasingly

894
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,930
important we want to support the ability

895
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,410
to copy freely between hardware software

896
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,700
firmware documentation specifications

897
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,920
you may want to take some key piece of

898
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,080
the hardware description and copy it

899
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,580
into the spec in order to document

900
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,010
something or copy something into the

901
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,349
comment of a piece of source code or

902
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:02,260
vice versa and the boundaries between

903
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,440
those become fuzzier over time FPGAs

904
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,700
become more important

905
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,920
hardware's described with software

906
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,140
there's the the running phrase that you

907
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,670
might have heard that software is eating

908
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,230
the world and in some ways it's kind of

909
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,720
eating hardware but you know hardware is

910
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
not going quietly and there's still a

911
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,640
very interesting subset that is firmly

912
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
in the hardware design space so the

913
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,560
ability to have these interoperate is

914
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,270
very critically important we want to

915
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,450
have compatible licenses for these so

916
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,460
I'm gonna echo the same thing Jessica

917
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,780
said that we certainly do not want

918
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,480
people going off and writing their own

919
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,730
license from scratch any more than we

920
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,760
would for software but if you are you

921
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,859
know one of those precious few people

922
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,609
who are doing or visions of a existing

923
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:50,800
well-established software license please

924
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,349
seriously consider accounting for

925
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:58,210
hardware in those new revisions and in

926
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,670
particular extending those provisions in

927
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,070
ways that make sense such as treating

928
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,950
physical Hardware similar to a compiled

929
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,170
binary with respect to provisions like

930
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,010
copyleft

931
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,920
so with regard to the open hardware see

932
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,290
ecosystem as a whole we're still very

933
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,750
much in the early days of open hardware

934
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,570
most production designs still do include

935
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,510
some proprietary components whether it

936
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,140
is some part library or some portion of

937
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,600
a circuit or whether it's simply the

938
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,670
fact that all of the individual ASIC

939
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,950
chips on the board are not themselves

940
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,520
open then we're still very similar to be

941
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,859
very early days of free software where

942
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,140
you know the new project was a set of

943
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,690
more usable more friendly free software

944
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,210
tools that sat on top of proprietary

945
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,790
UNIX systems and they existed within

946
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,460
that ecosystem that was kind of carving

947
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,410
out a niche of free software and

948
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,380
hardware is still in the same vein of

949
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,840
here is a little niche of open hardware

950
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,200
that is carved out within a broader

951
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,570
proprietary ecosystem and we want to

952
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,180
push to make that more open so along

953
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,980
those same lines one of the critical

954
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,350
needs for open hardware that we'd be

955
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,060
really interested in seeing people work

956
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,940
towards would be more open source parts

957
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,950
libraries and we think copyleft would go

958
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,010
a long way towards growing that

959
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,310
ecosystem and building that up to be

960
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,900
something that can interoperate with

961
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,770
itself very well so you know as said

962
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,440
before we're primarily aiming to provide

963
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,020
all the right questions rather than get

964
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,490
saying that we have all the right

965
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,100
answers but at the same time we do have

966
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,920
some specific recommendations so in

967
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,950
particular for chips if you're doing any

968
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,650
form of ASIC design whether on the small

969
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,810
scale or large scale if you want

970
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,140
copyleft the gplv3 is currently the best

971
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,810
choice of license because it's the only

972
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,150
license that actually mentions masks

973
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,210
works and covers all the way through to

974
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,850
hardware it's not perfect since it does

975
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:12,040
not necessarily extend the provisions to

976
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,980
force the distribution of source code to

977
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,770
anyone who has the physical chip but it

978
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,230
still goes further and fits better than

979
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,490
any other life

980
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,190
out there including the the Creative

981
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,230
Commons licenses that have commonly been

982
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,210
used for hardware which don't really

983
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,420
include any of those provisions for PCBs

984
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,430
you could absolutely use a copyleft

985
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,590
license if you like it's a good

986
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,080
statement of your intent and many people

987
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,850
will respect your intent whether there

988
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,580
is an exclusive right backing it or not

989
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,130
unfortunately or fortunately depending

990
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,080
on your perspective

991
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,050
PCBs as in a physical object form are

992
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,320
not actually protected in any way on the

993
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,180
one hand that's not necessarily a good

994
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,160
thing for copyleft on the other hand

995
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,690
that can be a boon to the maker

996
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,210
community that does do reverse

997
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,980
engineering and development of let me

998
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,840
build a compatible board for this random

999
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,550
chip so it's it's a mixed blessing we

1000
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,930
would definitely encourage the

1001
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,060
development and contribution of open

1002
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,640
parts libraries to try to get rid of

1003
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,119
that proprietary substrate that open

1004
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,790
hardware is still built upon and if you

1005
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,580
are drafting a future copyleft license

1006
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,570
of any kind

1007
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,730
definitely account for masks works or

1008
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,890
any other similar present or future

1009
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,230
illegal structure and treat physical

1010
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,330
hardware like binaries require the

1011
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,900
source code for it so with that I'd like

1012
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,520
to wrap things up and invite any

1013
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,330
questions or discussion

1014
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,470
I think we may have time for one or two

1015
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:57,839
questions hi Josh I have a very basic

1016
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,359
question I don't even see the point of

1017
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,410
copyleft hardware I you know I've

1018
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,150
written stuff under GPL and I've put it

1019
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,280
out I've been working Louis for 20-plus

1020
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,520
years but I don't did you know when I

1021
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,579
put stuff in copyleft in Suffern it

1022
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,780
frees up a lot of the barriers namely

1023
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,940
you know people are free to do whatever

1024
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,290
they want with it and it costs nothing

1025
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,900
all along the way that's not the case

1026
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,640
for hardware I mean even if it Brougham

1027
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,849
crap copyleft there's the things I'm

1028
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:32,250
preserving are not the same and I'm not

1029
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,460
even sure the the value that I'm

1030
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,060
bringing to people by doing so I you

1031
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,260
know there's an argument that can even

1032
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,050
be made that by preserving some of the

1033
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,980
rights I'm actually enabling myself to

1034
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,210
create cash reserves that allow me to

1035
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,900
create more of what people like so you

1036
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,430
could also argue that by keeping your

1037
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,230
software a proprietary that you are

1038
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,359
developing funds for future development

1039
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,920
and I think it's basically the same

1040
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,670
argument

1041
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,310
honestly we're in the really early days

1042
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,890
of open hardware we're in the very later

1043
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,770
stages of open software the ecosystems

1044
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,470
look so different right now they looked

1045
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,050
so similar back when open software's

1046
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,390
first being developed that you know when

1047
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,609
you're developing early-stage software

1048
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:19,589
and it is mostly duplicating things that

1049
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:22,500
exist but making them free the value of

1050
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,109
saying hey this is copyleft this needs

1051
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,720
to be kept open you know it seems like

1052
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,060
you have a smaller item of value and a

1053
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,579
smaller case to make for it but at the

1054
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,099
same time building up that ecosystem and

1055
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,780
eventually building up pieces of

1056
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,839
hardware that are difficult to replicate

1057
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,619
and easier to work with in an open form

1058
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,589
that if we want to encourage a broader

1059
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:49,530
open hardware ecosystem and encourage

1060
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,079
pieces of hardware that would otherwise

1061
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,530
be proprietary to be opened up then

1062
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,750
we're in a position where copyleft

1063
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,970
potentially gives us some

1064
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,000
leverage we wouldn't ordinarily have so

1065
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,720
in particular you know using permissive

1066
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:17,010
licenses would you have you have to pay

1067
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,200
to manufacture at the same time again

1068
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,440
software is eating the world in a way

1069
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,020
FPGAs don't require any additional cost

1070
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,570
each time you program them so as you're

1071
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,859
doing hardware development on FPGA yep

1072
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:32,490
sure

1073
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,250
I use the Kepler license extensively and

1074
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,890
I believe you when you say that it

1075
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,330
doesn't meet the requirements you have

1076
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,609
can you provide me the the rationale for

1077
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:42,599
why it doesn't work

1078
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:52,290
not here that extra okay it has a

1079
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,030
restriction on use it has to be for a

1080
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,630
lawful purpose they don't it's written

1081
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,430
in license yes yes exactly yeah so that

1082
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:08,130
otherwise I'm okay okay yeah it's the

1083
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,690
same thing that came up in the context

1084
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,369
of software with respect to like the

1085
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,230
hacktivism Oh license where they said

1086
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,180
you can't use this to do human rights

1087
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,010
violations but the problem is two people

1088
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,599
who would do that don't care what the

1089
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,700
license says so that's the only only

1090
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,170
complain a minute yeah that's the only

1091
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,030
reason why it doesn't qualify as an

1092
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,630
open-source software license thank you

1093
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,840
so much Josh and Jessica

1094
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:40,059
[Applause]
