1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,620
okay alright so this is a natural script

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,040
writing with guile by pretend Arnie

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,270
so Arnie's newest app towards a perfect

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,000
script writing with syntax so hello

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,790
audience and presenter I am pretending

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,730
to be Arnie Arnie is imaginary and is

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,890
not here presents his gratitude so hello

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,840
Arnie and then audience should applause

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,660
that's what it says don't leave him

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,200
hanging

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,690
he's not here that'd be so rude but you

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,910
luckily for bullet so the output of that

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,910
program that we just saw so okay the

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,499
audience applauses and stuff like that

15
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:44,850
and so you can see this is kind of cool

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,100
like it looks like plain text but it's

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,749
also got some scheme involved in there

18
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:53,640
kind of quasi quote II but yeah okay so

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,159
let's let's continue on so apparently

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,780
that's actual guile code parts the

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,390
scheme at read time there you can import

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,329
the language with spec so he's got a

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,729
whole website about wisp if you haven't

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,549
heard of wisp wisp is this kind of

25
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,890
whitespace significant list that Arnie's

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,090
been working on and it allows you to do

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,920
lisp as if like it's it allows you to

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,170
write schema in a very kind of like

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,560
pythonic natural-looking way so we're

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,409
prior are where do we start from

31
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,030
presenter say okay so I'm opposed to

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,700
give us 15 seconds eh okay so so this is

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,719
battle for wesnoth

34
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,670
I'm also familiar with this this

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,880
structure here well these are they

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,789
actually use I&I style config files for

37
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,460
their entire system including they

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,710
actually embed programs inside of the

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,799
string values of everything like with

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,840
their whole deal cells so anyway you

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,460
know for both dialogues they're not as

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,109
main purpose and yeah you you really

43
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,789
don't want to embed programs inside of

44
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,649
the values of strings in ini files

45
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,439
okay scum see him from monkey Isle hmm

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,229
not bad and something's odd but it does

47
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,899
have the kind of actor you know it looks

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,570
a little bit more like a script alright

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,320
Python his last try you know all these

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,390
quotes no action between the words it

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,459
doesn't look good look you got three

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,989
quotes there just to be able to save a

53
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,340
thing and have a new line okay

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,680
all right so what's next spells with

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Lisp so this actually I don't know if

56
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
anybody's ever seen this there's this

57
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,200
fun article about casting spells with

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,390
Lisp there's also a book that called the

59
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,770
came out called land of Lisp that

60
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,660
includes it as well and it's got a

61
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,550
little text adventure that you write in

62
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,830
side of Lisp you see Lisbon text

63
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,610
adventures another connection and you're

64
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,590
when you go and in but it looks very not

65
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,180
natural right okay

66
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,020
so examples where our knee is so here's

67
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,200
an example looks very very much so like

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
writing yeah just kind of a script but

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,310
it's again got the string quasi quoting

70
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,910
and the output looks good it has the

71
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,980
actual structure in there so here's some

72
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,750
more examples apparently this is

73
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,360
actually this looks like it's a defining

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,370
a list of answers here and again it has

75
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,750
the output but you can see that it

76
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,850
actually converted the stuff that was

77
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,230
here because it was a list and it

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,140
actually did a map across it or

79
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,600
something like that anyway his summary

80
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,460
is it works and he's happy and his next

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,130
step is making games main complication

82
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,560
shipping games made with guile you can

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,160
find the source code in the wisp oh here

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:48,190
thank you thanks Artie here's apparently

85
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,450
the basic version of the three witches

86
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,300
thing Scott I don't know I gave a talk I

87
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,160
have a blog post where I show it how to

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,360
use it with geeks dusty cloud geeks wisp

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,810
yeah so I mean it's kind of cool because

90
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,400
wisp list - the parentheses so I've used

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,130
it so you can see here side by side the

92
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,450
same code I'll make it a little bit

93
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,680
bigger so you can see it so here's a

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
hello world example and wisp and here's

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,190
a scheme version side by side and they

96
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,839
you can see they look pretty similar

97
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,260
right

98
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,029
so what which mostly does they can do

99
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,820
NES expression language not just skin as

100
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,120
long as it's got as long as it knows how

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,770
knows how to convert things to the

102
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,090
prophecy so what I'm like

103
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,400
a lot of other whitespace significant

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,040
languages you can do macros with it too

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,300
and stuff like that right which is

106
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,740
really hard like if you've used like

107
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,169
Julia or Dillon or something like that

108
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,729
they're theoretically kind of Python

109
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,940
like syntax but with macros except that

110
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,500
they actually use a completely different

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,470
syntax for the macros thing because you

112
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,940
know without without something as cool

113
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,350
as ice expressions you're just not gonna

114
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,490
get it you know I guess

115
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,990
but anyway so here's the the here's a

116
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,979
version of the code side by side we're

117
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,530
on the left you can see the geeks

118
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,280
definition of grep in skiing and then if

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,300
we shift to the right

120
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,070
you can see it actually looks pretty

121
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,490
similar yeah and actually I think quite

122
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,650
readable in fact I gave a talk on this

123
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,720
and I showed it to some friends and one

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,910
of my friends said Wow

125
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,330
looking at the right version of things

126
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,800
makes the left version of things a lot

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,750
less scary yeah and he's like and I

128
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,120
don't like lists right like and so he's

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,470
like now I'm not as scared of

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,910
parentheses right so I actually think

131
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,930
that's one of the coolest things about

132
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,200
wisp is that it it might end up being

133
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,830
you know a nice in-between of things

134
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,850
right and of course it would probably

135
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,970
make this look a lot less gnarly with

136
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,349
all my code although of course I love

137
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,650
parentheses so I don't mind it yeah

138
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,940
other questions

139
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,460
you can do questions for either Arnie's

140
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,139
thing because I can probably only answer

141
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,180
to such a limited amount or about

142
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,160
concurrency or eight sync things it's up

143
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:16,510
for whatever easier or I think I think

144
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,840
it's it's intended for both let's see

145
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,650
Barney's website did you have a live

146
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,970
version of the thing that's happening

147
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,130
right now live stream from the guile

148
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,470
development oh man it's so meta we get

149
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:41,110
deep okay so his whole idea here as far

150
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,210
as I understand was that he wanted to an

151
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,680
already came from Python

152
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,020
originally and he has a whole book that

153
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,789
he wrote that you can find online about

154
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,949
his experiences of moving from Python to

155
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,410
guile and I think he was he still found

156
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,669
it really difficult to overcome the

157
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:55,900
parentheses and now he likes the

158
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,479
parentheses right but but like like many

159
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,229
people

160
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:05,050
yeah he's quoting me here haha I guess

161
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,220
it's appropriate that I'm up here

162
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,570
representing any so here's them from

163
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,130
last year even more betta so uh so yeah

164
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,430
it's so I think that it's actually

165
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,110
intended to be both you know you could

166
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,610
theoretically you can you can definitely

167
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,080
write stuff in it and I hope think that

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,360
Arnie hopes too that people will but

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,639
it's also I think reduces the a lot of

170
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,410
the pain of coming into it and I think

171
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,320
it would be great if we had wisp like as

172
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,580
one of the languages that shipped with

173
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,800
Giles to VM by default right like we've

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,110
got this theoretical VM tower and it's

175
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,599
so much of an easy match to guile anyway

176
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,610
like why not include wisp with it right

177
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,410
like it seems like a pretty easy win for

178
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,699
us to include it and that when

179
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,169
somebody's like well I would use scheme

180
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,570
but I don't like the sass expressions we

181
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,030
could be like well look at wisp and like

182
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:58,180
you know yeah and just like Emacs

183
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,250
emulating them you're like it's exactly

184
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,020
like that other thing except for in all

185
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,820
the places that it's not and then they

186
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,500
go read the manual and they're like it's

187
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,520
like don't worry you don't have to

188
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,900
understand the front the season then

189
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,250
they can go read the manual and it's

190
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,960
full of parentheses but no I think it's

191
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,400
a pretty cool project I think that

192
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,229
Arnie's doing great work here okay

193
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,030
another question about whatever

194
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,120
so when I tested last and I know oh yeah

195
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,909
so the question is what's the overhead

196
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,380
passing messages and ate sink so a

197
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,729
there's a lot of things that can be sped

198
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,200
up like for example I'm converting

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,910
numbers to strings in there and I

200
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,529
actually could just have it not append

201
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,970
the numbers to a string and just have

202
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,050
them be separate and then I wouldn't

203
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,760
have that problem right so there's a lot

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,110
of things that could be sped up when I

205
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,410
did a test on my libri boot x200 you

206
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,209
know from a decade ago I was able to get

207
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,250
about I think twenty five to fifty

208
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,770
thousand messages at a time going four

209
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,520
per second so not great but not really

210
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,490
good but if you look at akka which is a

211
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,040
Java like actor/model thing they've got

212
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
a they've got a I think on modern

213
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
machine so I have no idea what it would

214
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,290
be on my axe 200 they've got about like

215
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,940
a million messages a second or something

216
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,459
like that so it can be improved I know

217
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,730
there's also I think a bug that you

218
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,010
won't notice in the mud but I know about

219
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,310
it where I I keep accidentally adding a

220
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,500
prompt every time you resume one of the

221
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,850
delimited configurations so that's

222
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,589
adding some overhead that's but it's

223
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,150
just a bug and it can be improved so I

224
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,459
don't really know but for me it feels

225
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,320
like twenty five thousand messages per

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,060
second is for most things that you're

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,230
gonna be doing is probably good enough

228
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,990
and you could also probably like so I'm

229
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,190
planning on writing a web server

230
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,529
application and for that the majority

231
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,900
I'm not planning to break in this to as

232
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,450
many fine-grained actor actors as like

233
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,970
the mud right it's okay to do your usual

234
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,709
thing where you have like the views and

235
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,480
you have like a request comes in and it

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,620
runs through the whole thing and that

237
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,330
runs out right so you could just have an

238
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,490
actor for the web server and then you

239
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,900
know when you've got your database thing

240
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,550
over there or you've got your running

241
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,320
like if we were it was media goblin and

242
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,330
your process transcoding videos you can

243
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,070
have an actor for the transcoder or

244
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,540
something like that right so you might

245
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,060
only have a few actors kind of rarely

246
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,589
sending messages between each other in

247
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,390
that kind of case so I don't know 25

248
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,190
case seems like okay enough for now I'm

249
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,080
not happy with it but I'm not unhappy

250
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,690
with it so yeah

251
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,350
of messages by reference because they

252
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,550
guaranteed immutability and the same

253
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,449
thing happens in Ireland

254
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,100
so I'm not copying I'm passing up by

255
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,830
reference and also in a Kyle listen to a

256
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
talk on that on the play in here they

257
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,130
don't completely a guaranteed

258
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,390
immutability it's like probably

259
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,300
immutable by default but which is you

260
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,210
know like and so in here I'm in mud sink

261
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,280
for the entire thing I'm passing ass

262
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,460
like like classic list ass expressions

263
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,350
between all these things right for the

264
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,270
most part like I'm passing anything that

265
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,440
could be written by scheme right

266
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,260
basically so this it would be fine as

267
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,820
long as nobody takes one of those cells

268
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,500
that I send and then mutates it by doing

269
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,930
like set critter and then just ruins my

270
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,850
program right like as long as they don't

271
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,310
do that it's fine right and and you even

272
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,620
could pass a mutable thing to another

273
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,330
actor if you're gonna never wrap it

274
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,890
handle it again or something and you're

275
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,500
in the same address space but but right

276
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,970
so this doesn't serialize it between

277
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,790
each thing it actually just constructs

278
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,530
the record of the message and then it

279
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,180
does that so it's by reference unless if

280
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,380
you're sending it to something on a

281
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,670
different process of course it's going

282
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,330
to serialize before yeah anyone else any

283
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,220
questions

284
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,730
didn't you have a question

285
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,780
so the thing about jewel that I said

286
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,060
earlier one cool thing about duality is

287
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,500
that you can implement one on top of the

288
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,080
other so it's possible

289
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,090
so Andy Wingo is definitely a way better

290
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,830
programmer than I am right like I'm

291
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,960
unintentionally having prompts tacked up

292
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,460
without realizing a try like I don't

293
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,110
think we go and make that mistake

294
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
because he like knows how things work

295
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,480
and I don't write and like and but like

296
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,200
so fibers I think is probably a lot

297
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,120
faster right now and stuff like that and

298
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
I would like to borrow the same data

299
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,940
structure that they're using for the

300
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,530
fight for the scheduler which is

301
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,750
actually borrowed from Ian prices PFDs

302
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,340
library but whether or not they're going

303
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,590
to merge or not I don't know

304
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,450
well first of all they implement two

305
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,440
very similar but technically different

306
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,300
abstractions right CFP versus the actor

307
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,590
model right those are not the same thing

308
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,880
but they can be implemented on top of

309
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,320
each other

310
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,570
I don't really know one of the things I

311
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,970
was going to have so CSP I think is a

312
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,280
lot more mathy in some ways to write the

313
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,350
actor models also has actually a fully

314
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,950
like developed math concept right of

315
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,990
course I'm using goups which like

316
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,820
immediately makes me feel extremely on

317
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,880
math II but but B but by the way I was

318
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,350
originally I never had time to program

319
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,640
in here but I was originally gonna have

320
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,350
a room that you could go into inside the

321
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,970
eight sink I've which would be the

322
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,040
eighth sink mutation chamber and there

323
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,570
would be a bunch of actors like each one

324
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,250
of them inside of a vat and they each

325
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,900
send a message and they like mutate

326
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,790
horribly and there's like this woman

327
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,050
who's like a functional programmer in

328
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,360
the corner and she's like oh disgusting

329
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,250
every time that it mutates and like have

330
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,020
you chatted with her she's like she's

331
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,580
like follow the White Rabbit to see like

332
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,350
the functional future version of actors

333
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,460
and then you can like follow the White

334
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,290
Rabbit and you go in there and they're

335
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,660
like they've got actors and then instead

336
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,120
of mutating horribly every time that a

337
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,770
message comes to them they actually

338
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,260
clone with a modified version of itself

339
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,510
and the old body gets thrown on top of

340
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,820
the garbage collector and now I dumped

341
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,290
into a chute and she's like this is much

342
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,710
more humane

343
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,500
I never got around to coding it so I

344
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,970
just had to describe it but anyway um so

345
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,100
yeah I don't really know I want and I

346
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,420
think Wingo doesn't know either

347
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,670
like when Wingo and I both in our dot

348
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,350
manuals both reference each other's

349
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,750
library and I think the main reason for

350
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,730
that is that nobody really knows right

351
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,880
like it could be that eventually just

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,380
fibers turns out to be way better than

353
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,970
eight sync and I'm just like wow just

354
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,290
moving over two fibers right I don't

355
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,810
know and I think that in in I think in

356
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,180
Wingo's some writing that he did he said

357
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,970
it's too early to guarantee what the

358
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,000
proper high level concept of things is

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
in guy'll right now but like we can

360
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,320
collaborate on the low level concept so

361
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,150
suspend aborts for example is kind of

362
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,400
the low level side of things and then we

363
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
can experiment and the high level thing

364
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,550
and I think that's good you know

365
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,170
unfortunately it does mean that maybe

366
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,850
eventually I'll completely rewrite mud

367
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,430
sync to be you know in in fibers or

368
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,720
something like that but in the meanwhile

369
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,000
I think it's still you know it's still

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,010
fun it's still fun to experiment with by

371
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,400
the way each sink is in Geeks so you can

372
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,080
and I think fibers will be soon

373
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,030
hopefully if we go study is going to try

374
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,250
to add it I don't know if he did I ran

375
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,600
into trouble as well trying to package

376
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,190
it but I think he said it could be

377
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,170
packaged now but anyway so if you want

378
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,480
to check out dial - eight sync and start

379
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,310
playing around there's a full tutorial

380
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,830
if you go to the eight sync there is a

381
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,630
full tutorial there's not API

382
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,620
documentation

383
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,900
who needs that but if you go to the

384
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,580
tutorial it'll actually walk you through

385
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,590
from writing an IRC BOTS to writing your

386
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,110
own network enabled actor and then it

387
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,020
just talks about how great Emacs is but

388
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,290
anyway yeah so I probably answer that in

389
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,510
over detail anybody else have any

390
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,460
questions about any of these things or

391
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,640
whatever

392
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,100
like every Thanksgiving maybe have to

393
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,060
know you mean the Python like syntax

394
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,820
okay well I mean I'm not Arnie so which

395
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,350
already should do it for sure but as

396
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,550
meta RT yeah as meta RT I say it that's

397
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,920
a great idea I should show up there I

398
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,959
should talk about my experiences of

399
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,600
moving from Python to guile and then

400
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,250
show why I wrote this other thing that

401
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,959
makes me feel like I'm writing Python

402
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,810
but I'm actually writing skiing so yes I

403
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,079
think it's a good idea as meta Arnie

404
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,889
anybody else I mean we could just take a

405
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:30,529
break or something all right

406
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,630
I raise it for the first time in this

407
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,250
entire thing we've got like an actual

408
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,710
break so all right thank you everybody

409
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:45,909
[Applause]
