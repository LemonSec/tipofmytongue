1
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:10,519
okay that's fine okay so good afternoon

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,389
everybody my name is Raymond knob I'm

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,190
very happy to be here actually like this

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,800
venue of a lot it's it's much more

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,330
relaxed than normal presentations so I

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,269
work at Adyar come in social tea police

7
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,519
which is in the South of France we have

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,749
a new name to our lab it's called the

9
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:33,130
open 5g lab and what I'm gonna do is

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,660
talk a little bit about some of the

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,949
things we're doing in open air interface

12
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:39,739
for network signal processing I don't

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,149
know if everybody here is aware of open

14
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,980
air interface it's one of the open

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,289
source projects that develops both

16
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,800
either B and UE implementations that run

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,379
on on us are peas and on other platforms

18
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,559
as well and I'm going to talk about some

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,570
of the stuff that's been going on in I'd

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,370
say the last six months on how we're

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,809
changing the architecture a little bit

22
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,269
to address some of the the research

23
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:04,069
goals that are that are going on in 5g

24
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,700
systems all right so what do I mean by

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,220
network signal processing there's a

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,689
trend and I'll show you a picture in a

27
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,420
second to you know to start it's

28
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,340
actually kind of funny because 2g

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,140
systems if you look at them they were

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,810
already split between you had the the

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,600
BTS and the MSC okay basically the BTS

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,979
was running the physical air and they

33
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,829
and the other was running the mac layer

34
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,649
in 3G there was a bit more going on in

35
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,479
the in the node B and but there was

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,899
still at the beginning of 3G the the all

37
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,829
of the Mac layer was running in the rnc

38
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,619
then when when 3G started getting faster

39
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,500
with HSPA and we came came along to 4G

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,969
they decided to put everything into the

41
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:52,250
Ino beat basically it's you have the

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,810
entire layer one and layer two stack in

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,320
the node B and the rest of it is in is

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,229
is for long in the network well it turns

45
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,130
out that now the the the operators and

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,210
the vendors they would like to start

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,720
splitting things again and but they're

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,369
doing it in a different way in a very

49
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,840
flexible way so this talk is looking at

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,980
how

51
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,319
you you you you you take a radio system

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,450
and either split it or there are other

53
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,519
terms that are you slice it that's more

54
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,670
from the perspective of services or from

55
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,870
from a computing perspective

56
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,879
distributing the computing in different

57
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,920
parts of the network both in the radio

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,830
processing and in the protocol stack

59
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,910
right there we different reasons for

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,400
doing this one of the reasons is to do

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,290
spatial signal processing if you want to

62
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,510
centralize the signal processing in

63
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,400
radio node that's connected to many

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,349
radio heads that's one reason for doing

65
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,730
it another one is the trend towards

66
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,870
doing a lot more network function

67
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,940
virtualization so some of the protocol

68
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,849
stack gets put into a virtualized

69
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,579
environment and more generally to do

70
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,180
processing of both access networks and

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,799
the core networks in a data center

72
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,660
environment that's that's that's the

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,120
reason this is happening so I'll go over

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,900
a little bit of the current

75
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,910
implementation that we have in open air

76
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,920
interface and a bit some notes on how

77
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,030
we're actually going to try and test

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,180
this and then some maybe at the end if

79
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,260
there's sometimes some generic

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,950
information about about our community

81
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,139
all right so this picture shows more or

82
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,750
less what what the vision of one of the

83
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
operators this is actually the vision of

84
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,720
China Mobile the way they see the the

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,540
the evolution of radio networks so

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,889
basically they have the concept of

87
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,930
what's known as as a remote radio system

88
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,139
the RS inside the remote radio system

89
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,790
base stations have different names they

90
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,579
call them remote radio units okay today

91
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,650
in 4G systems you have the remote radio

92
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,260
heads so it's an evolution if you like

93
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,410
the remote radio head now inside there

94
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,489
are different there are different kinds

95
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,829
of remote radio systems you have the

96
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,480
classical one this is what we have today

97
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,168
in 4G you have what's called a

98
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,040
a remote radio system where there's a

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,420
lot of collaboration between the nodes

100
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,490
so you have big base stations so

101
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,680
tri-sector base stations with with with

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,630
6 or 12 antennas and then you have

103
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,240
smaller Pico cells but they're all the

104
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,890
signals are all collected at this radial

105
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,440
node here where this is different from

106
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,350
from from today's networks these these

107
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,170
radio sites here will have a fiber optic

108
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,940
connection from the radio head down to a

109
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,920
control room at the bottom which is

110
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,000
basically where all the baseband

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,890
processing happening so you might have

112
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,550
at most a 30 40 meter optical link in

113
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,440
the new networks that 30 40 meters is

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,870
going to become 10 kilometres okay and

115
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,150
these notes here or potentially already

116
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,870
the ones closer to the central office of

117
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,420
the operators are going to be doing a

118
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,750
lot a lot of signal processing for a

119
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,530
whole network okay so that changes the

120
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,060
way you actually you actually do things

121
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,260
they changed the way you architect the

122
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,290
the signal processing system so you

123
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,760
would have something like this you might

124
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
you might have others that are quite

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,580
similar this will be the indoor system

126
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,500
so this could be in an airport and your

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,580
shopping center is something like that

128
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,980
you would also have one radio

129
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,350
aggregation unit and several remote

130
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,050
radio units or you would have the

131
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,470
massive MIMO remote radio units or radio

132
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,030
aggregation unit this is if you like

133
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,280
these two things are the same the only

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,810
difference is here the antennas are all

135
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,010
collected together and here they're

136
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,400
distributed in space but ultimately this

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,700
is the way the networks seem to be going

138
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,200
in if we consider this this

139
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,120
next-generation frontal interface this

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,080
part of the network

141
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,370
which is if you like where all the

142
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,140
signal process isn't happening there

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,640
call it they they're calling that the

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,980
frontal network and the network that

145
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,690
goes towards the core network is the

146
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,280
back home network those are the new

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,990
terminologies and you also see something

148
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,600
now called an X Hall or an X all network

149
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,740
and I'll explain what that is too

150
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,120
but you see there are basically three

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
entities here you have the radio units

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,810
of the remote radio units the

153
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,030
aggregation units and the radio cloud

154
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,450
centers so this this is this is the

155
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,100
terminology that we're actually also

156
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,760
using now in in open air interface so

157
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,200
we're trying to take our software which

158
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,090
was written sort of in a

159
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,449
monolithic form for an e not B and not

160
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,720
splitting it again into pieces now the

161
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,980
thing that becomes interesting is when

162
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,120
you split it into pieces you have to

163
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,949
interconnect those pieces together with

164
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,389
a network and then in the end you're

165
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,800
doing signal processing with the network

166
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
that's where that that's where the

167
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,380
terminology came from and so this kind

168
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,919
of splitting in the network there are

169
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,190
different languages if you ask the NGO

170
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,570
fine which is one of the I Triple E

171
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,270
groups they label the split points this

172
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,070
is though this is a protocol stack say

173
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,010
of a 4G base station you know the radio

174
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,510
interface so this is your IQ streams

175
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,270
like you would you would be handling in

176
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,630
in UHD this is the first stage of the

177
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,850
input so that you transferred in the

178
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,580
frequency domain and they get that name

179
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,979
and into a a number they call it an

180
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,110
interface for then you can go up further

181
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,000
in the stack they define this one

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,270
interface 3 which is just before the the

183
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,669
bit little level processing then another

184
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,889
one interface 2 and then there's that

185
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,650
one up there interface 1 prime from what

186
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm seeing out there

187
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,650
this interface exists today 4G uses this

188
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,990
they put a fancy label on it but that's

189
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,060
what this is the C pre interfaces this

190
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,979
today this one is coming okay that's

191
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,690
actually interesting because here this

192
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,479
is this is a split between if this is a

193
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,450
networked interface here this these

194
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,520
these operations the Fourier transforms

195
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,740
are running with the radio and then this

196
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,169
is running somewhere else

197
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,610
all right that's that one is that this

198
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,110
one is definitely one that is going to

199
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,060
happen now why is it gonna happen

200
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,970
because basically here you get a certain

201
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,570
amount of compression I show you how

202
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,380
that's done later another one that would

203
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,400
surely happen is this one here this is

204
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,240
something called fatty or femto access

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,919
it's the femto api there was there's a

206
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,780
there's a standardization form called

207
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,190
the Fanta forum which became the small

208
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,940
self forum

209
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,979
they standardized an API for basically

210
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,719
for this interface and at the time it

211
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,520
wasn't for a network

212
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,860
system it was the interface between the

213
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,349
system-on-chip and the or the baseband

214
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,620
processor and the protocol processor so

215
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,360
base station vendors that were making

216
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,399
small cells they could use this

217
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,670
specification here and interface with

218
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,290
another chipset and that's basically

219
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,730
what it was for and now they're

220
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,700
extending this to be networked in this

221
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,459
sense they call it in fat B the other

222
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,990
one that you're going to see is that one

223
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,390
all the way up at the top there because

224
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,709
it's very likely and I'll show you the

225
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,140
picture why that's what's going to allow

226
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,760
different systems 4G 5g Wi-Fi

227
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,370
millimeter-wave Wi-Fi millimeter-wave 5g

228
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,589
all to interconnect in the same data

229
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,620
center and so that if' one prime is also

230
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,959
one so today an open interface what

231
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,399
we're doing we've already implemented

232
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,730
these two and we're in the process of

233
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,000
implementing the one up on the top there

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,649
and there's also this one that we're in

235
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,420
discussion with with an industrial

236
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,209
partner that would like to see this all

237
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,399
right so there will be several splits

238
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,020
now what's important in in these systems

239
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,120
is that the the software that you have

240
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,630
be flexible enough to change the the

241
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,670
split not necessarily dynamically but

242
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,800
semi static depending on the types of

243
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,940
deployments you would use different

244
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,060
strategies it's not really that it it's

245
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,100
not really that informative this is more

246
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,149
informative because this shows you now

247
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,480
how how you you would instantiate these

248
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,440
things so this is a picture that I you

249
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,370
know sometimes when you go to

250
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,360
presentations of companies like Nokia

251
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,579
and Ericsson they flash a lot of slides

252
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,350
you don't get the slides and people are

253
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,270
always taking pictures I took a picture

254
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,839
of this one last year because it was it

255
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,279
helped us a little bit understand where

256
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,490
where people were going this shows you a

257
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,830
little bit what the way they need

258
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,510
the big guys they see the evolution of

259
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,730
the network so everything forgetting

260
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,230
about the core network everything seems

261
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,930
to be centered around this PD CP that's

262
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,250
called the packet data conversion

263
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,790
program and you'll see different kind of

264
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,560
systems eventually connecting to that

265
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,950
the LTE 5g and even Wi-Fi and very

266
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,519
likely also some of the the IOT based

267
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,670
air interfaces but what's important to

268
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,529
see is this this cloud that they have

269
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,329
here it's not it's it's a cloud because

270
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,550
it's running in essentially the central

271
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,620
office of the operator which is if you

272
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,140
went to the first one of the first

273
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,240
sessions this morning one of the first

274
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,890
presentations this morning in a session

275
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,279
on NFV and Sdn they were talking about

276
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,500
the this this the evolution of the

277
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,880
central office to an architecture like

278
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,209
this so basically this cloud which is

279
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,300
which is running radio processing both

280
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,250
protocol and potentially physical air

281
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,600
will be connected to different types of

282
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,790
systems with different types of latency

283
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,490
requirements if you're connecting for

284
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,250
instance to a over a 10 kilometer link

285
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,120
to a radio site from the central office

286
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,700
so replacing that hundred meter optical

287
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,089
fiber by by a 10 kilometer optical fiber

288
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,220
well that's a very low latency thing and

289
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,170
then there's physical layer happening

290
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,100
here in this data center the other types

291
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,920
of systems distr more any more classical

292
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,329
to what way in comparison to what we

293
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,610
have today very similar to what we have

294
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,550
today these would be you know hundreds

295
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,120
or maybe a Gigabit Ethernet link but

296
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,890
with a fairly high latency because your

297
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,810
your interfacing way up in the protocol

298
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,230
stack and so this is you know the this

299
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,820
is the way things are going so how are

300
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,519
we approaching this we define several

301
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,790
entities now in in our software we have

302
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,959
an entity that we're calling a radio

303
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,120
unit we have entities which we call the

304
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,829
actually the you know B's which are

305
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,089
separate from the radio units

306
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,260
and we have the the product well the you

307
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,760
know the physical layer part of the you

308
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,790
know be and the protocol stack of you

309
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,720
know be know we can further subdivide

310
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,950
this into things which weren't what

311
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,769
we're calling instances a radio or a

312
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,000
physical layer instance could be several

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,699
equivalent base stations inside and I'll

314
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,019
show you a picture why you would want to

315
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,060
do that one very clean clear example

316
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,769
these could be three sectors of a big

317
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,329
base station they're they're independent

318
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,389
protocol entities in some sense or they

319
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,209
could be what you would call a virtual

320
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,459
base station if you have an antenna

321
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,440
array if this is acting as an antenna

322
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,019
array and I purposely chose a different

323
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,110
number here here I put six radio units

324
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,480
and there are actually four base

325
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,100
stations here so there are more radio

326
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,019
units than base stations that means that

327
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,160
there's some sort of a mapping from

328
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,449
logical base stations to physical

329
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:41,540
antennas or physical radios and that's a

330
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,250
way that's also the way the systems are

331
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,420
going to be going for instance that

332
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,640
indoor that indoor system I showed you

333
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,899
before inside a building you might only

334
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,209
need three protocol instances but you

335
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,839
might have twenty antennas okay the same

336
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,600
thing for the massive MIMO the base

337
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,810
station with 256 antennas you're not

338
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,550
going to drive more than the equivalent

339
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,589
say of eight base stations or more maybe

340
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,660
sixteen base stations but you're using a

341
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,329
lot of antennas and so there's a there's

342
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,370
a notion of a mapping here from from

343
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,260
something that's that has meaning in the

344
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,610
protocol stack to something that has

345
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,029
meaning in the air that's that's that's

346
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:20,920
that's what it means

347
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,819
alright so that's how we've divided

348
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,899
things up now let me just give you what

349
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,550
is a radio unit the radio name is

350
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,350
something that's managing a physical

351
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,660
antenna which means the any can have are

352
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,940
there a local radio unit or a remote

353
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,000
radio unit okay so what that means it's

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,519
a two sided thing the radio units can

355
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,250
talk to each other one is on let's say

356
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,990
on the protocol side and the other is on

357
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,680
the radio side they're implicitly you're

358
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,120
putting a network between the two things

359
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,670
a fixed network between two three

360
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,560
now what does that actually do it

361
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,410
performs two operations it performs what

362
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,029
we're calling precoding and i'll explain

363
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,100
what that is so you basically that's

364
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,470
that operation of taking several logical

365
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,740
base stations and generating the signals

366
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,200
on the antennas right that's the notion

367
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,550
of precoding and it also does OFDM

368
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,460
modulation okay it does the it does the

369
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,970
conversion from frequency to time on the

370
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,190
transmit end and from time to frequency

371
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,930
on on the reception in the the instance

372
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,940
of the protocol stack is a separate set

373
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,610
of threads and contexts which implement

374
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,920
the the procedures of the base station

375
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,980
okay so it's it's a it's a it's a notion

376
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,320
of of processes I mean it would contain

377
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,190
the same Mack and RLC entities on top of

378
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,010
the physical here the component carrier

379
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,680
that that is actually the the entity

380
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,210
that manages the physical layer

381
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,260
procedures for a particular for a

382
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,080
particular carrier which could be a

383
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,240
separate frequency carrier but it could

384
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,580
also be a virtual carrier which is

385
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,570
controlled by the antennas and so that's

386
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,860
that's what these notions actually mean

387
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,649
[Music]

388
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,269
and just show the pictures so this is an

389
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,129
example of the radio unit that

390
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,709
implements the interface five so if you

391
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,480
remember that the interface five was the

392
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,309
one at the bottom of my picture there

393
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,529
that was a time domain signal so it's

394
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,299
the IQ this is equivalent to HD it's

395
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:38,720
completely equivalent to that so what do

396
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,239
we do here if let's look at the the

397
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,249
receive path alright so you have to see

398
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,230
this these are the inq signals that are

399
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,119
coming in on the receiver now the sorry

400
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,799
this is this these are the inq signals

401
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:58,429
that are coming from the the the the

402
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:00,350
radio unit on the other side so this is

403
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,540
this is a network input the first thing

404
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,709
we do is is decompose it's is is

405
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,380
decompress the signal so when we

406
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,539
transmit inq samples if you want to fit

407
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,220
them on Ethernet you you compress them a

408
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,709
little bit okay you can compress it and

409
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,240
we actually use a lock compression for

410
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,339
this you get a compression factor about

411
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,919
a half without any signal degradation

412
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:22,970
all right so this is coming from the

413
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,329
network we decompressed and then we

414
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,580
convert to the frequency domain so this

415
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,399
is the front end of a base station in

416
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,929
the other direction when we're

417
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,179
transmitting from the the protocol

418
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,549
context it goes into a block which does

419
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,429
the Wichitas precoding it has conversion

420
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,500
from frequency to time and then it

421
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,950
compresses so this is this is what this

422
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,950
is what happens in the radio unit on the

423
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,269
side of the of the protocol now let's

424
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:54,679
look at let's look at the other type of

425
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,200
interface so the the the 4.5 interface

426
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,470
so that's a little bit higher up okay

427
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,690
again if we look at what's coming from

428
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,480
the device we decompress the signal but

429
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,830
actually here there are two types of

430
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,419
signals

431
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,269
there's the there because in in a system

432
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,169
like 4G on the receive path you have the

433
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,360
the the terminal can transmit two types

434
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,860
of signals it can transmit the normal

435
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,500
uplink signal and control channels or it

436
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,940
can transmit the random access signal

437
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,559
those are two different kinds of signals

438
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,450
so you actually need two kinds of

439
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,340
packets to encode those signals and two

440
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,960
different types of processing

441
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,020
to wait when you receive you all right

442
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,630
so again this one the the data signal

443
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,429
part is compressed and the other part is

444
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,559
not we're going to the other direction

445
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,520
we have precoding and compression but

446
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,679
there's no Fourier transform because the

447
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,909
Fourier transform is done on the other

448
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,850
side all right so basically you already

449
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,350
see with this simple example what we're

450
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,870
doing is moving around pieces here I

451
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,460
have them on the side of the network on

452
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,559
the other one I have them on the side of

453
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,539
the the remote end so this is the remote

454
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,049
end so on this side on one side we're

455
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,669
connected to the network on the other

456
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,559
side we're connected to an our RF device

457
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,779
that could be for instance the USRP but

458
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,830
it could also be whatever we like there

459
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,309
is a notion here of splitting the

460
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,990
processing into the different types of

461
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,210
things we have so on the transmit side

462
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,220
we do the modulation and on the

463
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,870
reception side we do the demodulation

464
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,630
and we do a part of the the random

465
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,240
access channel demodulation in the radio

466
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:43,909
unit itself I'm gonna skip that let's

467
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:47,450
look at another example so the ones I

468
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,159
just showed you now were the examples of

469
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,529
the the the the radio units when we were

470
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,240
connecting directly any node be to a

471
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,870
radio unit in the in the first set of

472
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,220
slides I showed you there was also an

473
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,580
intermediate node this is an example of

474
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,990
what an intermediate node could look

475
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,210
like on one side you would have a

476
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,789
frontal interface for instance a little

477
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,409
bit higher up in the in the protocol

478
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,899
stack okay because this this would be a

479
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,039
note that might be a couple of

480
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,659
kilometers from the radio station the

481
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,600
radio stations and it would be connected

482
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,370
to a central office maybe 10 kilometers

483
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,890
further away so you have an optical link

484
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,549
there and an optical link here but this

485
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,799
signal processing is happening somewhere

486
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,340
in in the middle of the in in the middle

487
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,149
of the deployed region so in this unit I

488
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:43,820
put in two base stations or two logical

489
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,150
Bay

490
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,010
stations to Eno bees which are running

491
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,980
the physical air signal processing of to

492
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,050
base stations and it's connected to a

493
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,540
pre coder which is which is driving for

494
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,420
radio units okay so here's a mapping of

495
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,310
two base stations to four radio units

496
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,150
that that would be for instance

497
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,540
something that you could do if you were

498
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,030
in a small rural village right you would

499
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,890
put four maybe four radio units to cover

500
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,630
the village you would have one central

501
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,220
location which was doing all the signal

502
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,530
processing and then sending the the

503
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,480
protocol information back to the to the

504
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,340
central office this would be one example

505
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,420
another example would be a massive

506
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,540
mining base station it's essentially the

507
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,240
same thing on one side you have an

508
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,370
Ethernet frontal and on the other side

509
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,710
you have a sorry

510
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,750
Ethernet front altar the radio units and

511
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,020
on the other side you would have a

512
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,730
protocol interconnection this was an

513
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,080
example where you have eight base

514
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,790
stations or eight illogical base

515
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:52,910
stations driving 64 in Tennessee this is

516
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,580
essentially the same thing and the key

517
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,560
difference here with the respect to the

518
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,570
previous example is this block it's much

519
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,450
more complicated the pre coder is a much

520
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,350
more complicated block so let me let me

521
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,390
skip these things and talk a little bit

522
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,700
just how the processing is actually done

523
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,000
the radio unit itself if you think about

524
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,630
a a 4G system it has to do the

525
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,260
transmission and reception in parallel

526
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,100
and in in the system like LTE the the

527
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,200
signal that you're receiving at time n

528
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,490
is used to generate the signal that

529
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,570
you're transmitting a little bit in the

530
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,220
future so there's a dependence between

531
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,690
the signal you transmit in the future

532
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,090
and the one you're receiving a time in

533
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,710
so the way we decided to implement this

534
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,020
was to to that that fundamental thing in

535
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,720
in LT it's it's at time n + 4

536
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,730
milliseconds so the signal you receive

537
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,760
at time n

538
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,770
is necessary to constitute to generate

539
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,720
the signal that you transmit at time n

540
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
plus 4 milliseconds and that's that's

541
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,580
the way it works so basically every

542
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,640
processing thread does the following

543
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,740
thing it reads from what's below the

544
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,990
south whether it's a networked interface

545
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,390
or an RF interface it does the

546
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,240
processing for subframe in it wakes up

547
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,250
all of the the base station processes

548
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,040
that are waiting for it it waits for

549
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
them to finish their completion then

550
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,460
they have all of their their their

551
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,740
information necessary to generate the

552
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,170
signal at time n plus 4 and then we send

553
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,650
it out good n before so this is this is

554
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,540
quite simple that that's and you know

555
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,910
that's that's the way it works we have

556
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,430
another we have another thread that's

557
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,080
there just for the random access channel

558
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,850
by itself because that's a completely

559
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,150
independent independent thing and then

560
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,770
there's also one other thread which is

561
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,690
there when you receive on the frontal

562
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,580
interface so for instance if you're in a

563
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,620
radio unit the signal you receive from

564
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,060
the frontal interface is what you use to

565
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,060
transmit now if you're on an Ethernet

566
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,010
network there's a lot of jitter on an

567
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,780
Ethernet network it's not a real-time

568
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,390
thing it could be it could be real-time

569
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,360
but in if if it's very long distances

570
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,740
there is a significant amount of jitter

571
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,020
so you need some sort of an asynchronous

572
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,660
process to handle that that's why

573
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,950
there's that's why there's that kind of

574
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,620
a threat all right so this is really the

575
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,200
bait that the the basic mechanism of the

576
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,100
thing is this and you can see here the

577
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,580
overall picture of the way it works up

578
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,590
on top there you see the the the timing

579
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,460
of the different sub frames and

580
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,140
underneath you see how processors are

581
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,480
scheduled yellow means receive red means

582
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,610
transmit so we're always receiving and

583
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,660
then transmitting receiving and

584
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,760
transmitting now it turns out that you

585
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,240
can paralyze this by a factor 2 you know

586
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,630
in order to improve the performance so

587
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,070
if anybody's interested in the inner

588
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,400
workings that's that's the way it works

589
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,780
so let me just switch over to the other

590
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,080
part

591
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:24,300
yes this is the one you just that's what

592
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:33,480
I just said just the other one yes okay

593
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,720
I should be it should be a few minutes

594
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,580
so this is basically what we're building

595
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,230
here at your home to test this kind of

596
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,440
stuff so we have a we have a little data

597
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,400
center here which is basically a 5 5 Z

598
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,320
on servers so these are multi core

599
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,060
servers and 20 cores each in each

600
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,250
machine some of them are protocol stacks

601
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,830
some of them are for the physical layer

602
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,010
and then there's a network here of

603
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,570
switch switches these are standard Cisco

604
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,200
switches and radio units those remote

605
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,270
radio units that was talking about so

606
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,380
basically the open air interface is

607
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,390
going to be deployed on this data center

608
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,440
and segregated and split and and do some

609
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
of the processing on the radio units so

610
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,280
just to give you an idea what the the

611
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,450
the radios themselves are they're using

612
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,300
us artbeads they're using actually b200

613
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,370
meaning we want it we wanted to have a

614
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,810
very cheap very cheap hardware that you

615
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,550
have some external or F on top so we can

616
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,800
transmit in an indoor environment up to

617
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,310
15 DBM and each remote radio unit is

618
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,100
driven by an up board I don't know if

619
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,330
people know what that is that's a very

620
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,790
small intel architecture it's the size

621
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,460
of a Raspberry Pi and that that's

622
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,990
running enough signal processing to

623
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,180
implement the radio unit and the rest of

624
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,330
the stuff is running in the cloud and so

625
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,470
this is something we're in the process

626
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,480
of deploying now we have an order with

627
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,180
edits for 5,200 minutes so just very

628
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,130
quickly general general general

629
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,750
information for those that are

630
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,760
interested our software now will support

631
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,870
Lima steer we're still testing it with

632
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,730
with the most recent board we got from

633
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,620
them but it will work up to 10 megahertz

634
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,520
FDD today we've stabilized the you know

635
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,410
to be quite a bit in the last in the

636
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,410
last year we have full full applique

637
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,120
downlink throughput and ten megahertz

638
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,610
bandwidth and full downlink on 20

639
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,950
megahertz bandwidth we're starting to

640
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,140
test our scheduler of loaded schedulers

641
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,840
to load it with with terminals and soon

642
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,610
we'll have the mime emotes running as

643
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,650
well

644
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,610
another thing interesting for some

645
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,620
people are here there's been a lot of

646
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,810
development on the terminal side so did

647
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,790
any open air interface will run on the

648
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,100
terminals at full throughput up to ten

649
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,350
megahertz bandwidth just 35 megabit per

650
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,560
second down there and we're testing the

651
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,950
my moments now as well and just finally

652
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,680
for the core network there's work in the

653
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,420
community to get today testing with

654
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,300
commercially known bees in order to

655
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,090
robust apply our confession we've

656
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,860
integrated the dedicated bearer support

657
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,270
for those you know what that is that's

658
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,300
that's the support voice over LTE that's

659
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,400
that's in there Knapton I'm very happy

660
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,170
also say we've defaulted now to the Osmo

661
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,140
come gtp module this is very good that

662
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,540
helped a lot and now with some of the

663
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,570
partners in the community where we're

664
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,230
integrating some of the missing

665
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,260
procedures in the core network which

666
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,910
will make something much closer to the

667
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,870
commercial commercial core and so that's

668
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,430
it I'm sorry there was a lot of

669
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:45,600
information you will have to fly

670
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:55,759
[Applause]

671
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:15,990
yeah yeah well not in 40 in in five

672
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,660
years yes yes the evolution yes the

673
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:30,570
evolution well okay there there are two

674
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,100
things there are two things they want to

675
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,900
bring it down but they also want to

676
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,550
relax it at the same time so there will

677
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,110
be some services where it does have to

678
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,020
go way down and in that case those very

679
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,700
low latency freight front hauls are

680
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,790
gonna have to be even lower latency you

681
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,890
to support the the new waveforms I don't

682
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,210
know I don't have numbers for you here

683
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:54,450
oh that's that's that's doable as long

684
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,490
ago we haven't tested longer than a

685
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,530
hundred meter it's okay it's all copper

686
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,170
so basically the the way the network

687
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,930
goes I didn't have time to explain it

688
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,500
but these links here are copper links

689
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,890
maximum of 50 meters so it's standard

690
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,620
Gigabit Ethernet right so the the and

691
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,690
the the throughput that we need is on

692
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,930
the order of 200 megabits per second so

693
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,360
it's it's it's it's more than feasible

694
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,630
there and then the link between here and

695
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,240
here that's optical fiber but we're not

696
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,890
going to be doing ten kilometers in our

697
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,260
lab okay if you go to 10 kilometers then

698
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,690
they're issues but at the same time

699
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,580
there are there is one group in in our

700
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,380
community that has done the same

701
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,140
experiment with 20 kilometer fiber and

702
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,090
the only thing they have to do is adjust

703
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,140
the timing a little bit in the in the

704
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,270
radio unit itself so it was an FPGA

705
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,010
based radio unit they had to advance the

706
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,530
signal a little bit in order to to

707
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,120
handle the latency of the of the fiber

708
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,880
over 20 kilometers so it's feasible but

709
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,289
it's you have to you have to you have

710
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:19,389
the question for 5g is another one oh

711
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,570
sorry
