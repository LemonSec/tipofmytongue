1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,500
so good afternoon I'd like to present to

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:30,460
you ideas to people should really can I

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,480
have your attention please

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,210
[Music]

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,820
okay so basically what we want to

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,780
present here is some discussion we had

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,150
among inside today the document

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,720
foundation in how to modernize and to

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,210
bring to 2017 the liberal office help

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,020
what we have in the user knowledge

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,840
ecosystem is that we have the help

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,599
system that is bundled in in LibreOffice

13
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,570
we have user guides and books that are

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,670
written and published by the community

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,649
we have a very extensive wiki for a lot

16
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,179
of information gathering we have as an

17
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,039
ask bot it's a question-and-answer

18
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:25,689
website for the end user and we also use

19
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,869
mailing lists and also the user is able

20
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,539
to look into Google for information

21
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,840
sometimes Brown some some videos in

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,039
YouTube there is also a partial

23
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,009
OpenOffice forums and wikis and also

24
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,039
independent forums like Reddit and so on

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,990
okay so this is the universe of

26
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,889
information that you can get for the

27
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:54,130
LibreOffice technology so what we have

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,429
at the moment is the following the

29
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,159
liberal of this help is designed into

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,189
XML and it was designed about circa 2005

31
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,330
and at that time we had issues with

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,250
browsers the browser's browsers war was

33
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,110
full

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,280
in full no compatibility no one no

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
browser manufacturer was comfortable in

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,800
adopting standards so at that time Sun

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,020
Microsystems adopted an internal only

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,560
solution which is a specific XML to hold

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,050
the contents and the navigation of the

40
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,620
help system the internal browser is

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,740
writer web that was easy because you

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,650
just have one tool and you don't need to

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,780
test with several other browsers of

44
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,190
other browsers so then they develop a

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,680
C++ type wrapper to create an index and

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,130
to connect the dialogues to the do the

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,980
help pages okay the issue is that now

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,310
when you look at 2017 we have a complex

49
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,490
which we did and update hard to test and

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,630
visualize the XML that is written for

51
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,190
LibreOffice there is no rich text editor

52
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,560
available so what what we have is a help

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,489
authority Authority authoring extension

54
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,440
that you connects in your writer

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,560
document and then you start writing your

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,489
text your help page the problem is you

57
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,290
need quite a lot of skills in XML and

58
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,930
specificity of the schema to understand

59
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,020
what the help content is so for

60
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,270
end-users and for people that wants to

61
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,660
collaborate there is a quite steep entry

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,489
barrier to start writing help files is

63
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,410
also we considered it's an absolute

64
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,620
technology and for example we cannot

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,959
insert in the hub content we cannot

66
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,810
insert multimedia we can insert images

67
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,540
but not videos so this is a very old way

68
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,890
to assist the user looks old and

69
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,530
cumbersome to read because it's fully

70
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,940
textual

71
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,180
it's turns in terms of information no

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,330
animation no videos so the idea is to

73
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,200
move forward okay and to get a better

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,930
liberal office help okay so some

75
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,360
requirements that we have in this

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,120
challenge is first of all preserve the

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,310
legacy content we are not going to write

78
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
again everything so we have to use what

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,540
we have and transform it into something

80
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,240
better we want to lower the barrier for

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,760
the community participation so make it

82
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,910
easy for the newcomer to start

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,360
contributing to the help contents it's

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,580
much needed to give volunteers an

85
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,280
objective to contribute because some of

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,250
the community is eager to contribute but

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,290
they are not skilled for development and

88
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,500
they wants to add to to be part of the

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,070
of the team and by writing help pages by

90
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,250
by giving to the community to everybody

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,990
they are knowledge it's a good way for

92
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,650
that we want an easy to update and easy

93
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,980
to track software development we want a

94
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,090
dynamic vivid and pleasant way to to

95
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,540
read and watch use modern technology for

96
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,200
animations videos support the current

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,630
process of translations because in

98
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,650
libreoffice we have at least 30 to 50

99
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,690
active language out of more than 100 an

100
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,030
easy way to find informations in online

101
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,610
websites and to work online and offline

102
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,030
because in some in some locations you

103
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,690
don't have access to an Internet ok so

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,419
basically the idea is to start phasing

105
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:28,180
out the xhp technology and perhaps this

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,870
is just a suggestion start phasing in

107
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,800
html5 which contains a lot of

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,210
improvements from HTML and at that time

109
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,010
10 years after the H HP x HP

110
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,990
design html5 seems to be to cover most

111
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,410
of the requirements okay and also to

112
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,410
assist the offline help is to develop a

113
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,000
small JavaScript page server okay you

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,550
load a page that has JavaScript and the

115
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,490
JavaScript will help you in the

116
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,310
navigation okay so why phasing out this

117
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,150
XML well

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,060
the XML and exit a transformation has

119
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,500
issues it's not so standardized as we

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,720
see for common html5 I spent a lot of

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,240
time making discovering that the

122
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,770
transformation works in one browser

123
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,860
doesn't works in the other okay so it is

124
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,710
different and we would like to avoid to

125
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,890
have to be very specific to a to a given

126
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,980
browser okay and also it's not X s LT is

127
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,520
not a technology that is so easy to get

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,340
in the first greens ok so you need to

129
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,650
study on that understand what the

130
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,530
transformation are doing ok so it's

131
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,930
steep ramping for neophytes and the

132
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,660
community contributions and updates on

133
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,250
new contents X s LT is not by very few

134
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,670
its it wasn't important maybe 10 years

135
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,180
ago but today I don't think we are using

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,080
that much

137
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,590
this technology ok so what I see in the

138
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,039
W w3c web site is that this seems to be

139
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,850
a technology that is slowly phasing out

140
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,560
ok so we have this browser difference

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,610
that in the implementation of this pair

142
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,650
of technologies and I think that it's

143
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,040
becoming obsolete to replace it by a

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,209
richer

145
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:04,119
HTML well okay so this small JavaScript

146
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:07,089
micro server is will use be used to

147
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,240
first display the correct help page

148
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,579
required by libreoffice applications so

149
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,829
that when you click in the hub button

150
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,649
your dialog you need to go to the right

151
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,559
help page it's used most of the

152
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,619
resources such as navigation history

153
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,959
bookmarking caching included in any

154
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,589
major browser we handle the indexing and

155
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:32,949
searching text amounts pages so that we

156
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,059
can find and look for a specific string

157
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,579
whilst we're seeking specific keywords

158
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,329
and gets a list of pages and perhaps

159
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,959
supports X the old XML and the new HTML

160
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,259
simultaneously okay well this is

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,230
basically the idea that we have in terms

162
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,439
of evolving their hub contents and the

163
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,949
help technology I have been spending a

164
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,990
lot of time looking at what we have

165
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,170
there is good the results so far tests

166
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,829
were quite encouraging and perhaps we we

167
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,369
have a good way to not open the help

168
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,829
contents to a broader audience of

169
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,129
contributors so that's my message for

170
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,399
for you about the help of LibreOffice I

171
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,779
can take questions

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,469
[Applause]

173
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:49,150
no questions yes no timeline exactly we

174
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,280
are working on the availability of time

175
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,050
of any of the contributors so the

176
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,090
foundation is analyzing a possibility of

177
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,300
opening a tender to quickly have it

178
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,170
implemented the complexity is is low in

179
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,430
that case but it's an extensive work

180
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,410
some some issues has to be considered

181
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,370
specially to preserve and support the

182
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,500
translations of their contents

183
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,680

184
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,570
okay thank you

185
