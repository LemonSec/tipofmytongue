CSS basics and some a bit of JavaScript

27
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,600
there's huge introduction content to a

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,799
CSS there's a lot of tools out there

29

[Applause]

36
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,370
that can actually be done so the whole

37
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,210
thing turned out to be a thing I call

38
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,919
code invaders Kareem is basically

39
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,419
introducing people to programming

40
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,930
concepts like functions iteration in a

41
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,440
variables like the basic concepts of

42
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,680
programming at the same time they are

43
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,290
actually creating their own game

44
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,730
[Applause]

45
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,830

[Applause]

47
00:05:59,360 --> 00:07:18,720
which is just try to concatenate the

48
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:45,470
string that is across microcontroller

49
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,139
that 60 megahertz processor or maybe

50
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,419
like you know 2 kilobytes of memory or

51
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,610
maybe 20 kilowatts of programming space

52
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,790
[Applause]

53
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,730
[Applause]

54
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:13,220
[Applause]

55
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,810
this is a AVR chip

56
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,080
it's basically 16 megahertz it has 2

57
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,599
megabytes of memory that's like 2 mm

58
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,389
bytes of memory and you can put the

59
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,820
program that's like for the kilobytes or

60
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,630
you write C code for this stuff

61
00:08:38,940 --> 00:10:27,120
I see just the banks basic games

62
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,760
programming basics even a sprite on

63
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,860
screen this is the bat you animate this

64
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,870
brighter screen by switching between two

65
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,700
states and you just

66
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,459
[Music]

67
00:10:51,060 --> 00:11:49,600
this is does this have to do with people

68
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,170
we've never seen any code in their lives

69
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,870
so when we started doing building their

70
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,520
materials which will be open-source

71
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,660
hopefully which will be online so

72
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,590
everybody could try themselves as well

73
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,670
so when we started building this

74
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,340
material these kind of folks are really

75
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,670
give a cheer introduce people to basic

76
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,959
programming concepts

77
00:12:16,620 --> 00:13:44,110
which is also this is you will see in a

78
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,800
moment

79
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,910
just let me sweat this it's quick so the

80
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,790
idea is it's basically the exact same

81
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,550
thing that you see

82
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,599
[Music]

83
00:13:59,610 --> 00:15:16,140
a few moments and then it sits on your

84
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:30,000
shelf strains is a translation of the

85
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,649
JavaScript code that you just seen in

86
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,290
the browser into C code and put it onto

87
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,449
the device so what happens in the

88
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:39,490
background is basically when you

89
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,810
IDE this javascript code when you push a

90
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,990
button is being translated into C code

91
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,020
and the C code is that compiled into

92
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,220
machine code and let me just push the

93
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,380
compilation that will create us a

94
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:04,750
compiled version that I can open is your

95
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,350
JavaScript code is translated into

96
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:20,500
secret is straight to see because then

97
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,240
you start to experience a lot of edge

98
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:46,980
cases like C when you sort experiences

99
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,339
[Applause]

100
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,079
interactions between C between

101
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,709
JavaScript and C in doing one time what

102
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,690
happens here is compile time

103
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,820
interactions your JavaScript code is

104
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,429
turned into C code there are a lot of

105
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,380
constraints of course for the sakes of

106
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,849
creating the basic game and following

107
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,050
some basic rules are not using something

108
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,300
you know there was a there was a there

109
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,589
was a mention to creating

110
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,669
[Music]

111
00:17:37,550 --> 00:18:22,610
yes so if you are and just do the

112
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,520
nitpicky parts by actually writing or

113
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,320
modifying the C code try to get the

114
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,750
camera on board I actually show you this

115
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,920
live so when I hit the power button what

116
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,520
you will see or not see

117
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,880
ttttt

118
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
like that one

119
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,179
let's try this again shall we

120
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,400
oh because I tried to compile the C code

121
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,900
version of course yeah let's try this

122
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,260
again

123
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,889
how much better

124
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,369

[Music]

127
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,850
in JavaScript why is that important

128
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,340
javascript itself this is just a webpage

129
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,049
thinks that you can do with just a web

130
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:43,490
page including about we have this tiny

131
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,910
thing here he might recognize this is

132
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:53,630
one of the one of the enemies oh but I'm

133
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:01,280
not very good jar but this right remind

134
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,669
you something that falls down close it

135
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:16,549
all right I'm gonna go to the code in

136
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:20,230
there if you see this

137

what happens and responsive web pages

149
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,789
keyboards interesting stuff that they

150
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:52,340
can assess the network how about a

151
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,780
monster like that nothing maybe that's

152
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:06,750
where monster ish I'd say this yeah

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,380
for my third touch Bob if you have a

156
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,299
touchscreen device with your pockets

157
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:30,159
right where some happens here is

158
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,289
basically I am connecting to the same

159
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,190
web page from the same thing between the

160
00:24:36,190 --> 00:25:35,100
two in the same time I should put

161
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,450
[Music]

162
00:25:40,450 --> 00:26:03,759
with images on this just about the

163
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,129
details do we know questions questions

164
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,649
to make you make it a good one

165
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:26,950
we have a question yes you see the devil

166
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,119
[Applause]

167
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:36,399
because not straight to type so you are

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,470
T in three types and stuff like that all

169
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,330
the things are really wanna fix are not

170
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,700
working objects are not going to working

171

[Music]

172
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,549
devices that you could use and

173
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,120
transportation just created energy I

174
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,250
just played an empty I devices as well
