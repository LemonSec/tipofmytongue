1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,530
introducing from

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,790
for panic we have Ian I Berg who will be

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,740
talking about adventures and building in

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,509
[Applause]

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,960
[Music]

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,279
[Music]

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,580
[Applause]

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,759
this room

9
00:01:33,940 --> 00:02:15,800
because that's its own utility just to

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,890
show you how to orchestrate certain

11
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,170
tasks with unique rules because at the

12
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,400
end of the day it's not just about

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:53,660
running smack here and so we can say

14
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,600
this is an operating system but yet I'm

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,730
going the Batmen of you host actual

16
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,280
production software on this on this

17
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,060
operating system

18
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,380
[Music]

19
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,840
[Applause]

20
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:38,540
we're talking about that you know once

21
00:03:38,540 --> 00:04:12,860
again you think about the source of this

22
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,769
of this game and then you think about

23
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,329
how dramatically different

24
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,700
this application is from this

25
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,790
application it's making engine X work

26
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,060
versus the prior application and and you

27
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,100
start thinking what is appropriate to be

28
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,330
putting all my servers so what is this

29
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,700
important like I've asked these

30
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,169
questions but why is this really

31
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,620
important

32
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,160
he's pretty famous in the body works too

33
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,250
at 8016 now and he has this video that

34
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,260
he month ago called the end of cloud

35
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,990
computing if you've got like 30 40

36
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,460
minutes the ball in the next week I

37
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,350
would just watch this it's kind of cool

38
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,510
and he kind of talks about these shifts

39
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:06,580
in computing that we've been taking like

40
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,790
switching away because closer and closer

41
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,729
to so called edge computing this is

42
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,530
going to force us the developers to

43
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,110
deploy and compute resources in a

44
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,330
different manner than what we've been

45
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,160
used to for a while and I think this is

46
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,870
really going to start driving a lot of

47
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,510
things and in terms of infrastructure

48
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,330
and so forth and this is why I think

49
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,040
this is one reasons why I think this

50
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,260
matters so versus you know that we use

51
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,890
day to day in and out right now if we

52
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,780
look at something like OpenStack is like

53
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,080
the canonical you know if your own

54
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
private cloud solution I mean nobody

55
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,140
psyche is probably like where you're

56
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,990
starting right you have to think about

57
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,440
like let this was booked for you know is

58
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:13,770
for vm's years it's not the size of the

59
00:06:13,770 --> 00:07:28,710
shape the the implementation that we'd

60
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,230
be traversing but the reality is is that

61
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:37,020
you know the physical as well

62
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,200
[Applause]

63
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,389
[Applause]

64
00:07:47,250 --> 00:08:36,390
you know

65
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,610
[Music]

66
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,710
[Music]

67
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:16,610
[Music]

68
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,550
we got a testing environment staging

69
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:41,750
that you know we depend on what we're

70
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,710
using you know

71
00:09:42,710 --> 00:10:05,360
cue and so forth and downs manageability

72
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,790
to me is kind of what really defined

73
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,610
modern cloud computing environment it

74
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,250
was that ability to just like instantly

75
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,860
create 100 vm's and then trash them or

76
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,380
cloning them and then push them to

77
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,880
somewhere else and and I think that's

78
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,310
that's a key thing that we we don't even

79
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,950
think about anymore I mean like to

80
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,100
about wind like AWS region goes down for

81
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,530
two minutes out of the year you know and

82
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,240
then compare that to what things were

83
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,730
like maybe 10 15 years ago so so what is

84
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,710
that well there's things like your

85
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,960
service discovery so zookeeper and

86
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,210
that's you being all that sort of stuff

87
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,240
rich which a lot of people I think a lot

88
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,160
of shops don't really need this level

89
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,280
[Applause]

90
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,630
[Applause]

91
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,970
more familiar with like with the reverse

92
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,560
proxies on in genetics that sort of

93
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,680
thing and then you know your resource

94
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,449
aware of scheduling I allow me source

95
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,889
and so forth once again this is not

96
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:16,829
something that I would expect most small

97
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:30,420
shops to ever even so something as

98
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:43,949
simple as deploying most compiled

99
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,569
languages you're actually going to be

100
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,310
creating the new VM each and every

101
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,870
single time you had that deploy button

102
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,519
and you're going to push that image up

103
00:11:50,519 --> 00:12:16,709
to I don't think a lot of shops actually

104
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:20,759
do when you actually are because once

105
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,990
again you're removing that VM from that

106
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,819
bouncing pool or wherever it's residing

107
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:29,069
and so you have to think about how that

108
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,829
works the mechanics of it same thing

109
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,509
with fellow gerber so in unique URLs

110
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,770
that's pretty pretty typical to have

111
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,710
virtual memory it's just not really a

112
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,530
concept that seems to work and you curl

113
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,530
and and so if I have an app that just

114
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,870
keeps on requesting more and more memory

115
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,280
and all of a sudden it runs out of

116
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,770
memory you know and it stops responding

117
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,570
to requests and so forth how do you

118
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,200
handle it

119
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,510
do you kill it do you switch it out you

120
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,760
know there's the software that we've

121
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
learned him to handle this

122
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,840
for today's orchestrations

123
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,810
that software doesn't quite work in new

124
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,810
current land because of these reasons

125
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,800
and then you start thinking about things

126
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,780
like Lamba and all the service and

127
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,540
functionalist type of paradigms on top

128
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,850
and how they interact with containers

129
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,060
and vm's and so forth and how about

130
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:30,480
different ways we'll come in to flavor

131
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,210
the ends you can't whatever but in most

132
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,620
cases most people they're going to be

133
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,930
working with vm's and so you might have

134
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,660
ones that are compliant and that's great

135
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,790
because then you can do lots of tricks

136
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,220
but not all of them are and system

137
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,920
you'll just get like a straight-up disk

138
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:59,040
image to be working with so you know

139
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,070
every CPU in the past like what eight

140
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,620
nine years has the extensions necessary

141
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,730
but they're not always turned on

142
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,770
obviously if you're on Google

143
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,970
you're not gonna want me to do a

144
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,649
hypervisor hypervisor you're have to

145
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,450
actually burn your own AMI there's

146
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,080
software out there that does that it's

147
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,730
it's painful not that it doesn't work

148
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,070
it's painful that the big clouds weren't

149
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,060
really meant for it and of course the

150
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,840
hypervisor situation on the OS X sucks

151
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,190
[Applause]

152
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,740
it's one of these things that you know

153
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,720
as developers we haven't like really had

154
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,970
to do walk down this path before and so

155
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,399
there's so much software that's kind of

156
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,770
missing that can be written

157
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:55,330
hopefully by people in this audience so

158
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,770
one of the things we're gonna discuss

159
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,660
real quick was debugging unique URLs

160
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,880
this is actually a video up on YouTube

161
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,370
of us where we were debugging a go

162
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,899
unique kernel and of course we're

163
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,399
catching the panics and the stack traces

164
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,130
and you know the GC and everything

165
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,250
not to mention gdb obviously the most

166
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,290
maybe you've all known the bugger out

167
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,140
there besides you know and that's Visual

168
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,320
Studio you know works perfectly fine

169
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,649
here's another example of gdb debugging

170
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,350
ago uni journal this is actually on runs

171
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,570
github wiki and different

172
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,050
implementations have their own

173
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,470
interfaces so this is include os's here

174
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,180
which looks a little bit different now

175
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,899
this is and then one from OS V as well

176
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,779
so the old notion that they're not

177
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,730
debuggable is kind of the next topic

178
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,350
networking and so so once again working

179
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,529
with

180
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,420
[Applause]

181
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,430
[Music]

182
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,579
[Applause]

183
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,250
[Music]

184
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,599
[Music]

185
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,129
[Applause]

186
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,809
because you can't pass the frames and so

187
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:58,209
after you like little tricks with that

188
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,699
and so forth - for the traffic

189
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:10,980
appropriately from a1 to and so forth

190
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,770
this is a common example what you're

191
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,449
going to run into when you're rolling

192
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:24,609
your own locations in the program there

193
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,569
was making outgoing connections but your

194
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,280
509 right and so there's a pretty clear

195
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,679
indication that wasn't fine - sir okay

196
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,270
we'll just pop the certain whatever

197
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,669
needs to be figure out where that is and

198
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,640
of course the distro out there and every

199
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,710
single you know different system not

200
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,390
only has a different file name for this

201
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,250
but stores in a completely different

202
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,809
location which is just completely

203
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:51,658
batshit insane that this is even a thing

204
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,380
this is the that you normally probably

205
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,910
don't have to do when you're on like

206
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,890
Ubuntu or whatever but you do have to

207
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,420
kind of think about and deal with in and

208
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,820
of course you can play with DNS and so

209
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,370
forth as well and DNS mask here is

210
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,860
probably gonna be your friend although

211
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,450
most people just kind of like pass it on

212
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,890
through whatever gateway traffic but you

213
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,990
can also use this for like DHCP so if

214
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,380
you have like a multi-tenant situation

215
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,410
then you can just like DNS mask on that

216
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,630
bridge that you're serving dhcp through

217
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,480
kind of a large subject because there's

218
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,770
so many different things that you can do

219
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:48,990
with them obviously and so once again if

220
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,640
we go back to some of these tutorials on

221
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,370
the wiki a lot of them like the point at

222
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,640
which is great for some things like if

223
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,830
you have a static website and there's

224
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,230
absolutely no mutation going on that's

225
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,160
great to use that one pod system that is

226
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,050
like inherently totally immutable

227
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:19,559
because work on any popular language out

228
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,780
there I guarantee you you have some sort

229
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,940
of temp files being read and going

230
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,980
somewhere you got uploads doing

231
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,380
something there's so much crap going on

232
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:38,220
like I would say won't be and so it's

233
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
it's something to think about you know

234
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,310
certain applications that make sense and

235
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,480
applications makes no sense and so when

236
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,130
you're choosing your file system you

237
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,520
want to think about you know which one

238
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,220
to the other

239
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,279
[Music]

240
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:20,230
once again this gives you running like

241
00:20:20,230 --> 00:21:13,330
that it's and that's the case based

242
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,420
volumes and volume copies so obviously

243
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,040
you probably won't push assistance for

244
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,830
some of these you know the backups and

245
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,300
so forth and of course for life

246
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,510
migration and so forth you know the

247
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,370
volume copies kind of come in handy too

248
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,410
so if I have a database running and I

249
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,080
don't really want to take it offline but

250
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,900
I want that copy of it it's a great way

251
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,200
to go about doing it so these operations

252
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,600
can be done with like ETFs or SX news

253
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,720
it's probably like the I think I think

254
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,680
that tool comes on any Mac right away

255
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,240
and so you can do most of those

256
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,820
operations that make the first I think

257
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,280
it's time to move but once again this is

258
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:21,320
one of those tools that you find that we

259
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,440
probably want some standard you know we

260
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:39,980
actually ship these things to like a

261
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,770
tenant situation you might just mount

262
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,180
another block device and then if you're

263
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:56,420
just playing around and actually

264
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:04,030
something like what's the worst thing

265
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,310
today and what's the most needed

266
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,860
improvement I would say testing like is

267
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,530
a complete and just to show you how how

268
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,440
crazy this actually is we have a problem

269
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,290
with the go we maintained run for and

270
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,510
basically garbage collection wasn't

271
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,440
happening for a particular it wasn't

272
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,720
happening so we had a batch come in it

273
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,150
fixed it and we're like we should we

274
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,440
should make a regression test to make

275
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,690
sure that it actually is that state and

276
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,910
so this test actually

277
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,139
[Music]

278
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,739
[Music]

279
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,449
[Applause]

280
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,729
[Music]

281
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:58,580
design basically means ssh is off the

282
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,650
window right once again a security

283
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:10,810
feature we're just gonna make it into

284
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,150
like ten lines of PHP or something it's

285
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,320
not necessary it's just to show you that

286
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,150
if you think outside of the box you can

287
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,580
easily do the exact same thing thousand

288
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,860
different ways and here you can kind of

289
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,100
see the hosts file through like a tin

290
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,560
wine

291
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,210
[Music]

292
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,890
something with volume deploy workflows

293
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,570
so this is a really interesting thing

294
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,900
that once again really only works with

295
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,460
like uni girls you would never do this

296
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,270
with a big vm because it just does not

297
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,970
make any sense but if i want to spin up

298
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,040
like 100 Newton kernels and then like

299
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,320
push out changes to them without

300
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,850
spinning them down this this change

301
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,660
might work and so basically the trick

302
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,060
here is as you can kind of see in this

303
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,510
global proof-of-concept thing CMS or PHP

304
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:16,070
app says it includes like and so

305
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:32,150
obviously it's not only continuing the

306
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,720
code because once again we don't

307
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,020
actually have to recompile the actual

308
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,490
kernel itself we're just mounting a new

309
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,470
partition and boom and so this is this

310
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,030
is like Windows examples like you would

311
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,380
never ever do in a regular VM it's just

312
00:26:47,380 --> 00:27:02,990
it's just kind of stupid once again I'm

313
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:10,570
not sure me unfold screaming this

314
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,800
so we'll show this and

315
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,730
HTML 1 I got to drag this window as well

316
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,949
[Music]

317
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,010
all right so because I apparently am not

318
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,870
so great with the ad the projector but

319
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,630
basically you know we have the HTML

320
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,670
example and then you know we can we can

321
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,340
run like a PHP example doing the same

322
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:11,990
thing all right so this one is at 4.4 it

323
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:19,450
us six dot

324
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,989
yeah

325
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,750
so and you know you can also search for

326
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,360
like other ones you can kind of see that

327
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,400
gives you ideas on how to kind of

328
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,500
improve certain workloads and certain

329
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,350
tooling around the ecosystem anyways

330
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:26,340
questions Thanks

331
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,040
thanks for the talk actually lots of

332
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,660
problems you were describing are

333
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,670
actually soft by kubernetes and mazes

334
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,110
today they they are not scheduling or

335
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,570
managing único notes but they're

336
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,210
managing docker containers why not build

337
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,850
on these primitives to like have the

338
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,190
management layer and just get a unique

339
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,430
URLs on bare metal provider like take it

340
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,000
for example so you mention Asus young

341
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,980
missiles but more kubernetes I know

342
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,760
there's Dell EMC there's a unique yeah

343
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,510
so so yeah good question so I really

344
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,830
glossed over that but there's there's

345
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,880
quite a few problems

346
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,820
Mace's is a great example because they

347
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,910
kind of they were working on this before

348
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,410
kind of the whole container hoopla

349
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,180
kubernetes is not a great example

350
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,170
unfortunately a lot of like kubernetes

351
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,420
installations are already provisioned on

352
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,510
top of beams to begin with and so having

353
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,210
two layers of provisioning like that

354
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,370
don't really work too well you really

355
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,020
need the orchestration layer at the

356
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,170
hypervisor level not on top of that VM

357
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,850
if you do it just needs to be kind of

358
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,510
like out-of-band and so forth

359
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,140
so yeah unique for instance out of EMC

360
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,670
they do have integration with kubernetes

361
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,580
but once again like like trying to do

362
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,920
that on Google Cloud it's gonna suck

363
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,850
trying to do that

364
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,979
anywhere else is gonna suck you really

365
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,869
you really need the hardware

366
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:59,289
acceleration and in order to do that

367
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,869
scheduling that needs to be kind of

368
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:08,950
built at a lower layer and as for like

369
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,019
meso s-- that's another interesting

370
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,179
thing because that's where scheduling

371
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,830
layers kind of compete so meso is is

372
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,070
more for that process level right

373
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,239
because now you can subdivide those

374
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,789
resources so like that scheduling part

375
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,340
where I showed you but when when you

376
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,710
have that VM that scheduling has

377
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,330
effectively moved down into the

378
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,399
hypervisor and it's probably not like

379
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,289
the best place for it at least we don't

380
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,849
have software that were like really

381
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,220
takes advantage of it very well yet but

382
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,090
NATO's that much works a lot better up

383
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,099
here on on top of that VM layer

384
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,950
yep yeah so like pakad dotnet for

385
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,470
instance they do they do a lot of bare

386
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,390
metal provisioning and so forth so yeah

387
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,740
that's that's that's what I'm saying

388
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,610
though is home

389
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,370
there's a there's definitely frameworks

390
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,020
out there like OpenStack for instance

391
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,050
obviously allows you to do that but

392
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,390
those frameworks are built for kind of

393
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,450
classic VMs whereas you know like some

394
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,000
of the like include OS for instance you

395
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,830
run some of their demos and it's a

396
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,400
megabyte tops so that's that's a very

397
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:31,370
different VM than a gigabyte image I'm

398
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,840
able to say that I don't have experience

399
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,360
with this and but they have experience

400
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,630
on the old type of computing world how

401
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,790
far away are we from from a production

402
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,370
system yeah so I mean there's production

403
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,520
users today you know I talked about not

404
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
talking about IOT

405
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,640
not talking about nfe but in a fee is

406
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,620
probably where like the most production

407
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,590
stuff is running today big telcos are

408
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,520
starting to utilize this base basically

409
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,910
a lot of the telcos old hardware stuff

410
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,470
is being eaten alive by software and

411
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,060
like a lot of the nfe stuff is actually

412
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,580
used utilizing unique URLs Ericsson in

413
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,119
particular I know is using that stuff on

414
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,399
the web side there's definitely some

415
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,350
people that are toiling around with it

416
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,270
there's a lot of tooling yet to be read

417
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,440
in though so

418
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,499
[Applause]
