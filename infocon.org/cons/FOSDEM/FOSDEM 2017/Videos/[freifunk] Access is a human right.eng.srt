1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,980
before we start I'm here from Munich

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,710
today Munich is ill and at home and we

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,230
are have to send best wishes to unique

4

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,660
to Faust them and hopefully present this

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,270
talk by ourselves but I think I could

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,179
give you the same input today and we

8
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,699
marched a little bit of a presentation

9
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:44,730
to to have the same content and I think

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,440
I could present and inspire you by the

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719

33
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,260
my own company with software and data

34
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,540
center stuff and you can follow me on

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,870

sentences about the fight on Greenland

37
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,860
we do some some research with the

38
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,130
community empower people to build free

39
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,040
and open infrastructure there is a main

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,530
goal of five func we have some regional

41
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,930
meetings conferences at the cows

42
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,910
communication congress we have meetings

43
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,540
here at the FOSDEM a lot of - guys are

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,410
here and especially we as far from

45
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,320
Rhineland providing our own autonomous

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,900
system so in a backbone network and we

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,800
get some IP transit to other foreign

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,990
communities in Germany to connect their

49
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,850
routers the wireless routers to the

50
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,860
Internet

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,520
and there are some some special thing

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,680
about the last two years it becomes more

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,940
and more and and big and big thing and

54
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,960
the community to give some access into

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,350
the internet or to socially

56
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,190
disadvantaged people especially the

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,860
refugees it's situation in Germany and

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,710
then I think the other communities I see

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,350
some year from from Spain Italy and from

60
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,620
from Greek of AF same situation and

61
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,040
providing some internet access to

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,800
socially disadvantaged people and

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
especially the refugees that are coming

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,610
from different nations to us and then

65
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,670
it's essential to have internet

66
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,760
connectivity when you will be in a in an

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,970
other country yeah

68
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,150
the topic of the talk is access is a

69
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,490
human right and we stand for this we are

70
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,730
in many situations we see that it is not

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,440
it's not true it it's not this iteration

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,630
we have but we fight for this and we

73
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,070
hope to get much more support and the

74
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,380
interesting point is that we have some

75
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,960
different views on these situation we

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,930
have the view from the European side we

77
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,330
have the in Germany with the abuse from

78
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,150
the national lights and there are some

79
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,390
some conflicts and I will give you a

80
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,940
short overview the the concert says that

81
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,270
with without internet access the people

82
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,120
can take part on the space of

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,800
possibilities and I'm I'm ruthless I

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,480
think it is true and there a second

85
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,040
decision from from the parliamentary

86
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,780
assemble assembly and it's it's near the

87
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,930
same that the Convention of Human Rights

88
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,169
says that it is essential to have access

89
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,839
to the Internet

90
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,650
to participate so then we have the

91
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,159
German Constitutional Rights and there I

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,509
guess

93
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,349
there we have some some some other

94
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:16,550
points it is the freedom of information

95
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,259
is very important and then we have the

96
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,089
general right of personality there's

97
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:30,129
some other point it is not direct in

98
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,639
connection with the XS but it is when

99
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,149
you participate on the Internet then you

100
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,249
have the general right of personality

101
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:46,960
and it might be it might be different

102
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,879
from the European thing there is some

103
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,849
some very interesting points the

104
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,509
fundamental right on social integration

105
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:06,409
and when you take a look of how the sink

106
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,459
change you get in social with other

107
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,949
people it has moved we can say today

108
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,469
totally to the Internet no no more

109
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,669
postcards I think in in post boxes is it

110
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:32,839
is not not not more today yeah then we

111
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,949
have a decision from the Bundeswehr it's

112
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,249
off in Germany it is a legal legal court

113
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:46,909
and they said that it is the huge the

114
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,629
huge the huge all the people are using

115
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,709
the internet for the daily for for daily

116
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,949
and so when the internet connection or

117
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,180
they have no access

118
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,939
it has an an very big impact for for

119
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,290
them because you have it you have it all

120
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,650
and you couldn't couldn't use couldn't

121
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,620
live without this so that is the dissent

122
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,340
in entropic yeah there will be and human

123
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,110
rights and education to participate to

124
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,190
get information to be to do research and

125
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,850
to do to do other things that are

126
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,169
connected with education and we think

127
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,310
that this is from for personal for me it

128
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,830
was an important point when when you do

129
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,680
some some education it is it is

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,180
necessary to have access and to have

131
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,190
connection to to the Internet and there

132
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,660
we have the convention of the rights

133
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,200
what yeah with with in in special with

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,770
the status of refugees and the the

135
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,320
problem when when there is no accident

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,250
no connection for them yeah at at the

137
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,630
end the United Nations reports at the

138
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,690
same and said that disconnecting people

139
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,180
from the Internet of the human rights

140
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,640
violation and against international law

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,100
so but when I go to the to the next SEP

142
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,270
chapter of the talk first a short

143
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,220
introduction what is frightful but I

144
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,100
think the most people know this project

145
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,650
and I told you before that we are

146
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,680
providing some some free internet access

147
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,710
for for people and connect them and then

148
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,290
when we when we go to the next slide we

149
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,200
have here some some information what we

150
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,670
what we mean was we we for us it's not

151
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,580
only that that they have no costs the

152
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,550
user so it is much more important that

153
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,670
you have no restrictions on the network

154
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,780
under the X no censorship and no other

155
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,270
no ever unfree things but

156
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,770
it is not only to to doesn't pay for for

157
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,029
the excess there's no business model we

158
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,430
we are sure that nobody pays pay in in

159
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,149
the masses for for internet access at

160
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,110
free Wi-Fi so that was a situation and

161
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,070
in Germany we have a lot of communities

162
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,880
in the old country and a lot of access

163
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,029
nodes 40,000 today approximately we have

164
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,870
there are some statistics on the maps

165
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,570
from the from the community where where

166
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,970
the nodes are in place you can you could

167
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,480
provide GPS coordinates and then you

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,240
could watch on the maps yeah and the

169
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,520
second thing is that we think at -

170
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,910
community and we make some political

171
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,070
decisions discussions that yeah it is a

172
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,420
governance task to connect the people

173
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,640
and when you when you remember the

174
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,770
slides before that the European Union

175
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,140
say it very clear that it's a human

176
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,839
right to to give access the pooper and

177
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,700
yeah but it is different from the

178
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,740
situation that we have or I can only see

179
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,410
the situation in in Germany but I hear

180
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,990
the same from other countries yeah yeah

181
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,260
they are a few points to can communicate

182
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,390
to can access to education and

183
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,930
information in foreign country when you

184
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,160
will be there and it is better to use

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,500
money for food and family and not to be

186
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,610
pay for prepaid internet I saw we see

187
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,190
this and a lot of refugee camps in

188
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,870
Germany that there are a lot of internet

189
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,350
prepaid dial us and the people gave gave

190
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,980
more of the money in the Hat for

191
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,820
to get internet access s2s to buy um

192
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,899
food and and other stuff yeah yeah the

193
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,089
problem is that there is no DSL or fibre

194
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,269
or anything else in a refugee camp it is

195
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,600
very hard to build Internet in the riot

196
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,079
and there's no business moto model I

197
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,839
told you before so we we did we need two

198
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,320
nations and there was a huge challenge

199
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,199
to bring volunteers as in these

200
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,389
conference and in other projects

201
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,370
together was profession that they're

202
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,610
providing organization make organization

203
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,420
of the refugee camp there we had there

204
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,510
are a lot of technical challenges with

205
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,970
smash networks for the mess and and so

206
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:35,110
with respire for the mass I'm very proud

207
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,620
of all the people in the rifle community

208
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,690
there and and the other wireless

209
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,089
communities they say we accepting the

210
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,410
challenge and we are we are we have to

211
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,959
provide some internet for these people

212
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,010
came to us and then the result is that

213
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,149
we have most and 400 refugee and social

214
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,040
projects connected over the two or three

215
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,010
years but we we do this as fashion

216
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,250
community already before but I think the

217
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,329
last 2 years was an heaven big big

218
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,290
impact so yeah and then at the end we

219
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,319
have both Internet and access for many

220
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:26,199
thousands of people so I have here a few

221
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,699
pictures how we connect these locations

222
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:34,089
from from high positions we install some

223
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,319
radio equipment and and then in the

224
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,529
refugee case a BIOS in Germany it was so

225
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,139
in in also in Australia that we had of a

226
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,290
lot of sports parks that are not more in

227
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,560
use and then they built some some tents

228
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,870
on it

229
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,440
smiie on the on the lightning and the

230
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,589
lightning equipment there up and we

231
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,020
install there some samurai do some radio

232
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,120
equipment to get some appaling and this

233
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,339
hour the tents rather people live and

234
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,380
you could imagine that it is not so easy

235
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,170
to bring there some infrastructure power

236
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,820
is a big problem you have your

237
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,029
smartphone and the battery is I think

238
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:24,940
the the most the most problem to to keep

239
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,339
it full and yeah this you see these

240
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:32,260
these electronic air power stations to

241
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,400
to charge your phone and it's not so

242
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,160
easy when you would like to to connect a

243
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,400
wireless router on this and you Efrain

244
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,100
cable plug in so this is a reason why

245
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,560
this one is blacked out and one day

246
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,940
later I became of the family and put the

247
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,700
put the smartphone in it applied off the

248
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,529
lights Reuter and the the internet

249
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,200
uplink is stone and there's a lot of

250
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,800
trouble then and the in the camp at the

251
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,490
end I would invite you to join the

252
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,520
community go to our internet site there

253
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,320
are much more contact details and there

254
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,350
are a lot of information about the local

255
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,740
community I think summary in the Enders

256
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,520
that the European Union said very clear

257
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,760
there is human right to connect the

258
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,070
people to the Internet but the situation

259
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,400
in the country especially in Germany is

260
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,640
not the same and it is not the reality

261
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,080
we have we as community could do a lot

262
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,839
of a lot of good stuff but it is not the

263
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,900
we couldn't not solve the whole problem

264
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,900
and connect all these people we could do

265
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,260
only let little steps and with the power

266
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,079
you have us in community project it is

267
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,339
limited the

268
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,500
sauce is limited but I think we could do

269
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,650
our best and and help people to connect

270
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,029
to the internet there were some special

271
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,390
project but I would spend some words

272
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,010
together was the flora fine for high

273
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,779
nets back in Berlin and refugees

274
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,309
emancipation they are built some

275
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,350
Internet up links and some internet

276
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,590
cafes to Gaza was refugees and I think

277
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,289
it is the best project we have and the

278
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,840
frightful community to to engage the

279
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,720
people and to empower the people they

280
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,830
came to us to build same by myself these

281
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,250
infrastructure we we are not an service

282
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,340
provider for the the people because it

283
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,169
doesn't scale it's to do this as a

284
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:59,799
community project so we have to empower

285
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,710
the people to build by themselves the

286
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,529
infrastructure they need and to build

287
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:08,860
some wireless equipment or mesh networks

288
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,309
to connect the refugee camps or the

289
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,850
other the other location they have such

290
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,140
as internet gives so far thanks for

291
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,270
listening and when you have questions I

292
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:36,340
think we have some time eight minutes

293
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,370
for question area here are some person

294
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:47,890
question we have some what about - in

295
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,710
other countries we have some projects as

296
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,549
goofy net as 9aux as villain Slovenia

297
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:02,529
and and in in in different countries we

298
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,100
have same projects to reside here to

299
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,279
build mesh networks connect people it is

300
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,270
not called - and I think it is important

301
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,059
to know that five fingers much more than

302
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,210
to build infrastructure it is to

303
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,530
transfer know-how

304
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,370
to build these to have these meetings to

305
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,080
connect the people to to spend some

306
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,960
know-how and and to transfer the

307
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,510
know-how to to the people they are

308
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,200
interested but in a lot of countries we

309
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,380
have the same idea and the same spirit

310
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,020
to build such free Wi-Fi networks yeah

311
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,990
and we are in contact with them have

312
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,600
meetings and met them at cows

313
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,850
Communication Congress or hear some

314
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,860
other talks are here from from other

315
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,780
Wi-Fi free Wi-Fi projects yeah and it's

316
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:09,670
good to have them yeah how we dear was

317
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,400
lost for the uplink in the in decides

318
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,360
yeah we had the coasts for mapping out

319
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,680
okay the coasts yeah in many in many

320
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,170
situations we have some some private

321
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,940
organizations or some some family or

322
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,630
some house or some company nearby an

323
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,820
refugee camp and they're spent the

324
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,280
uplink so there we have no nothing to

325
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,030
pay for the uplink and for us it is

326
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,800
important to have people that support

327
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,220
this project not only was money so we

328
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,790
spent some Ventris from the fibre or dsl

329
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,190
connection and in other situations we

330
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,490
have quite good corporations with local

331
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,530
cities and the infrastructure providers

332
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,600
from the cities and they spend us some

333
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,370
fiber or diesel or but it's it's much

334
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,680
different because the country is very

335
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,190
big and you have some different

336
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,480
organizations and the city you have

337
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,580
corporations or you have no corporation

338
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,910
and it's it's different but in the most

339
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,990
cases we didn't pay for this some other

340
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,310
questions yeah

341
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,690
yeah how we deal with the government law

342
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,370
we as 5:09 land an isp and providing the

343
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,820
transit for the for the communities we

344
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,190
saw on IP addresses and so we could

345
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,830
handle the abuse when there will be

346
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,260
abuse by ourselves

347
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,840
so not we are not in in some problems

348
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,220
with some other providers so but in

349
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,140
Germany the law was changes it is called

350
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,150
surah halftone in in German and it is so

351
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,550
that when you provide an open veil on

352
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,630
access point you get the provider

353
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,460
privilege that it is like in an open

354
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,290
access note it is not the same when it

355
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,410
is zero private Wi-Fi at home so the the

356
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,490
the problem was the lowest is not not so

357
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,090
big anymore because we could really good

358
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,890
fixes was on ice peon and some other

359
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,130
situations before this we had some turn

360
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,310
VPN connections to Sweden or other

361
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,040
countries rather we have not so these

362
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,950
problems but it's changed today yeah

363
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,760
some other questions

364
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,120
No

365
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:21,460
how we how we do to to get to to to

366
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,120
bring our perspective from the right of

367
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,350
access to the politicans and what what

368
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,230
what we which point we reached was the

369
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,270
question at the moment I think that it

370
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,080
is so that in a lot of cities in Germany

371
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,549
there are quite good corporations with

372
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,640
the local help organizations or other

373
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,140
other organizations there are dealing

374
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,049
with these with these refugees camps or

375
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:07,659
some other social social rooms or social

376
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,080
collapse for for people that could have

377
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,860
internet access there but we didn't have

378
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:23,049
a huge accepted accepted decision that

379
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:27,120
the polygon said we have to build as

380
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,940
standard an internet connection in such

381
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,840
a location as such we word and shower or

382
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,049
toilet though we are not at this point I

383
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,049
think it is the goal to come to this

384
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,330
point but it's not the situation we have

385
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:49,559
reached yet it is a very long way to to

386
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,799
to be there I think it is on a good way

387
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:00,580
but it takes much more time here there

388
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,200
are some question quick quickly because

389
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,240
we have like one minute and 30 seconds

390
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,470
last question

391
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:12,340
Ventris how yeah what about the

392
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,999
bandwidth in our networks so I could

393
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,629
only give you the information about the

394
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:21,639
- grind and backbone that we provide and

395
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,029
there a lot of this 40,000 approximately

396
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,340
440 thousand nodes connected to this

397
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,129
there we have an average in traffic

398
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:35,799
about five gigabits per second and a lot

399
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,629
of this traffic we can bring out by

400
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:43,539
peering Zand internet exchanges we have

401
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,989
three different sites in Berlin

402
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,580
Frankfurt and düsseldorf where we

403
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,379
connected to some other carriers and

404
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,119
provide us and get some sponsoring with

405
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,339
IP transit so this is no problem no

406
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,469
problem and we didn't have to pay for

407
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,839
for traffic and the backbone because

408
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,789
it's all that we have eyeball traffic

409
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,159
the excess traffic and you can get a

410
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,899
free settlement peering with the content

411
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:08,289
providers and not receive the problem

412
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,359
with the access providers we have so

413
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,700
that is no problem for us yeah yeah

414
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,570
thanks a lot

415
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,249
enjoy the rest of the conference

416
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,000
you
