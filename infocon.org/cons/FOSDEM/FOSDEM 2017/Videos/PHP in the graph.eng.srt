1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,600
yeah three minutes but relies good thank

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,660
you

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,450
let's go because so pitch P in the graph

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,250
one okay so you're all beginners you

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
start from nothing right dude I can tell

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,430
you anything

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,170
okay I see very good news but you want

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,580
one of them on the efferent I can

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,540
sacrifice one anyway so which is one of

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,000
the language to actually go into a graph

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,010
and learn and extract that

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:20,610
presenting the graph itself this way

13
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,180
okay we're still live right okay so um

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,280
first parts first part of the talk we

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,580
are going to tell you about the well

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,600
refers thanks I guess oh that's a nice

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,530
here we talk about our well this cover

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,000
this cover of the graph presentation of

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,380
the graph itself so you have the basis

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,700
of the elements that's going to be very

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,079
easy there are two elements there are

22
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,110
nodes on there are edges or I will call

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,630
them and then we're going to dwell on to

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,640
the most interesting part which is how

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,310
to to traverse how to handle this big

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,350
blob of data okay it's not going to be

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,000
like SQL where everything is nice and

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,479
clean

29
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,820
okay column values and everything is

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,920
understood in it right everyone does

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,639
that right okay it's a big mess so we're

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,820
going to see how to how to go to move to

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,500
move like that and I will finish by

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,390
grabbing in PHP itself being that

35
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,700
whatever I'm going to

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,890
present you now well if you want to use

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,930
it from history of course well you need

38
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,580
you need the link at the end and I'll

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,860
just show you at the end so we skip the

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,989
installation and the dirty are greasy

41
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,650
details for the for the end for those of

42
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,480
you who don't know me I'm the proud

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,880
owner of the first half than ever that's

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,099
my main achievement life I just you know

45
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,280
I haven't turned it I've been doing

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,680
pitch before since the last century and

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,060
I'm probably the most I would say

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,430
negative of a Belgium that's possible

49
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,599
yeah apple pie wonderful say it's quick

50
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,569
quick middle answer net finish Wow very

51
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,220
badly but whatever and now you don't

52
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,200
tell the country so probably you you

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,420
take me put it in a you know for to

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,790
booth and then I get you get a Belgian

55
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,700
guy so just a culture anyway um I'll

56
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,069
come do I do I end up with working with

57
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,049
Grammy just because of that I do for

58
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,720
living static analysis so I don't even

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,930
run the coach you plan to run but before

60
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,030
that I actually try to review it so

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,190
initially I did that on my own you know

62
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,440
with my little ants well my little eyes

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,690
I realize it was way too much

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,500
okay currently it's like three o'clock

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,880
so I probably I've already reviewed 12

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,920
the two million lines of code since this

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,569
morning the machine is working for that

68
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,420
on all the time so basically it takes it

69
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,609
takes a piece of PHP just break it into

70
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,370
tokens and rebuilds the links there is

71
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,900
between the lines of code and what's

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,000
really acting and you think about a

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,250
little bit about it it's more it's not a

74
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,950
table you can put you know every if in

75
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,900
one table and the switch and another one

76
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,310
that the method calls in a third one

77
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,019
that's going to be a mess you need

78
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,670
relations between all those elements

79
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,730
whatever artificial they may be and and

80
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,470
you want them into something that's that

81
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,150
you can query so that's exactly the

82
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,489
experience that so one thing we're going

83
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:06,680
to work on and that's why we're going to

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,480
we're going to hear me listen and

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,420
mention WordPress or arts is that we're

86
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,639
going to work on a very simple graph

87
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,930
which is the the WordPress called graph

88
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,279
okay I chose WordPress because it's

89
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,709
mostly functions so you understand it's

90
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,240
kind of easy we take you take one

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,520
function the function has a name so

92
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,110
that's what I'm going to collect and

93
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,580
from there I know

94
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,370
what are the other piece of fiction that

95
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,169
are being called okay

96
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,479
no namespaces so that makes the war we

97
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,189
very simple by itself

98
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,349
most of the petri function has been

99
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,629
removed so we won't have anything that's

100
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:44,750
alone like that okay anyone understands

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,590
what we're working on right okay so if

102
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,000
you understand what you're working on

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,930
then you're going to understand that

104
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,969
because what I've shown you before that

105
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:58,789
this precept of linking a function and

106
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,349
it's different functional under the

107
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,830
definition we will end you up with that

108
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,379
so it's very easy you can see there are

109
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:11,479
nodes and there are links but there are

110
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,340
a little bit so how does that that's

111
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,580
actually the usual experience I have

112
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,479
okay I think about turning a network

113
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,279
into something that I can understand so

114
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,960
iconic that and the connection is

115
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,599
usually can off easy because here what

116
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,370
do I need I need to talk a nice speech

117
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,469
peacoat so there is the tokenizer

118
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:33,080
explain extension for that I collect the

119
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,289
strings I put that in a just select the

120
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,849
one that are important and I put that in

121
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,159
a docx format and that's it and then I

122
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,779
try to understand what's there and I

123
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,849
don't know right I I don't even know

124
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:44,800
what to start with

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,240
okay maybe I'll be turning it when you

126
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,860
look at a school table then you start at

127
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,289
the top i 0 i do want something i that's

128
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,940
here you don't have that where is it

129
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,870
where is the number 0 I don't know so we

130
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,639
need a direct reversing language and

131
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,919
that's actually the definition for

132
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,830
traversal language something that helps

133
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,930
you navigate through the maze of the

134
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,960
graph and will actually provide you with

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,729
entry interesting that that's what we

136
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,580
want weldable ok and the one I I

137
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,289
discovered when I start looking for

138
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,580
something that was not as well to

139
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,800
support my audit says that ego thing was

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
gremlin it was I don't know like four or

141
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,300
five years ago so hey that was in

142
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,460
version 2 and we're going to work only

143
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,889
on version 3 today which is the current

144
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,830
version since a year or something so

145
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,750
what is important so first it's a

146
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,909
domain-specific language so it's going

147
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,250
to work only for graph ok you can apply

148
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,870
that to something else we will actually

149
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,420
see how the concept

150
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,850
can actually lose into PHP that would be

151
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,370
the confusion it's a programming

152
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,380
language again I'm going to compare that

153
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,260
with a SQL it is not something where you

154
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,970
feel you have templates and you just

155
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,310
feel a few key words and you get some

156
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,110
data no no we're going to work we can

157
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,420
add variables we can maybe not declare

158
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,130
classes that's going to be overkill I

159
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,230
guess but we can do lots of thing we can

160
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,850
have loops we can have variables and

161
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,280
Crimmins filtering you know things like

162
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,740
that so that's the important important

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,820
part um

164
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,190
it's open source code is online it's

165
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,320
like you don't have a key incubator at

166
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,090
the moment where you can go and download

167
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,460
it it's vendor ID lipsticks also we do

168
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,770
not depend on one database okay it's

169
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,810
more standard as for that as a scale you

170
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,340
can apply that to many different data

171
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,170
there's a list of them at the end so you

172
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,090
when when it's important to know that

173
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,610
you'll have the list so the letters are

174
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,940
here G is V and E um they're actually

175
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,410
the first the first thing that is

176
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,210
actually kind of fast dressing when you

177
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,190
start is that the vocabulary is not the

178
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,850
same okay

179
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,890
so when we talk about where the grameen

180
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,740
we have draft for GE e for edges and V

181
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,530
four vertices simple enough we're pets

182
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,780
there's one okay seems like it's some

183
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,350
kind of common language and edges you

184
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,850
may also have people talk about nodes

185
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,610
links and the data sets or objects and

186
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,170
relations and the data set again

187
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,290
okay so suddenly is two three different

188
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,440
words for the same reality okay be ready

189
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,580
for that it's not the same the only

190
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,860
situation while you end up with the same

191
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,070
concept apply two different realities so

192
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,020
be ready we'll try to stick with this

193
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,670
one although I've been learning that

194
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,890
myself on my own swab I usually you know

195
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,110
mix them please switch them from one to

196
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,490
the other

197
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,550
first first actor we are what we use the

198
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,060
G here that will be a recurring gag G

199
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,309
for graph maybe for Remy I don't exactly

200
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,429
know which way to visit okay but it's

201
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,630
the different one we have so we'll

202
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,600
always start the the query with that and

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,270
the first one are the vertices which are

204
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,370
in the nose the object itself but are in

205
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,320
the database the big dot red dots no

206
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,450
black tops you've seen in the first a

207
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,110
year cloud that's that's it we have

208
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,080
what can we say from that first you get

209
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,940
it the full list of them is and if you

210
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,130
just want one of them every single node

211
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,790
as an ID so just like database is all of

212
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,620
them get one okay the edges will get

213
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,750
another one but you start with that if

214
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,800
you ask for it

215
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,390
while you get it and you don't get any

216
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,690
anything back okay what you see here is

217
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,030
really a method call okay I have a first

218
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,590
object which is kind of special we're

219
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,140
not going to go into it in any moment

220
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,600
we'll just wait for the rest the rest

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,460
our methods I'm going to call methods

222
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,350
each method are going to be linked with

223
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,780
the present a preceding one so a method

224
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,660
will probably return an object a vertex

225
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,020
place I'd no details yet of course we're

226
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,190
going to be able to go in through the

227
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,380
details but that's what you're at the

228
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,230
beginning the first one if you want to

229
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,320
go inside an object well the graph most

230
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,810
of the graphs are steam Alex okay so you

231
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,030
can put anything you want inside an

232
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,090
object in terms of properties so if you

233
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,710
ask for the object of course you get the

234
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,450
object itself if you want to go inside

235
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,060
the properties that core values and you

236
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,670
can have the usual suspects in terms of

237
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,790
value type so strings boolean's integers

238
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,960
reals arrays so we can start full arrays

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,850
in there in them a reason for range

240
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,890
again that can be interesting to have

241
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,050
but you can have them and doesn't care

242
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,820
defined somewhere or not okay you can

243
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,430
always create one destroy alarm if it

244
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,060
does not exist even return now so even

245
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,260
the time you end up with the null then

246
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,440
probably going to stop the world query

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,940
anywhere so for example v1 does not

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,710
exist then it's a no the rest will be

249
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,030
done and we end up with an arrow easy

250
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,220
enough for that to up to that nothing

251
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,710
surprising right okay so let's move on

252
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,230
if you want to do to some discovery and

253
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,060
again when your be here that's that's a

254
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,030
really useful tool value map okay you've

255
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,590
seen that values

256
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,510
they all the values itself as long as

257
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,670
you know the lane if you don't know you

258
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,410
want to discover what's inside the graph

259
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,450
then value map is going to return you

260
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,740
everything in jizan format yeah no

261
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,010
anyway you know right here it's a

262
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,420
tracing here I moved to another to

263
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,730
another value we can get the wall east

264
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,810
or even just one of them like that so

265
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,560
discovery when you don't know what's in

266
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,900
there you can start with a value that's

267
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,680
an important our SIGINT concrete here

268
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,100
the edges okay so we have the object we

269
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,080
now after link them that will be the

270
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,910
work of the edges they are stored

271
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,710
conveniently into the big methods you

272
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,760
can access any edges by its I need which

273
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,590
also has an ID and the two of them are

274
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,500
separated what we want here but there

275
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,090
are two separated on the two to them

276
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,270
they're two separate sets and the only

277
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,310
thing that's special about ages is that

278
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,380
they always were there three things they

279
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,060
can have properties just like we've seen

280
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,150
for the object okay same stuff the

281
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,850
properties to same values so when you're

282
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,310
crawling on the space you can always you

283
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,860
know check something in the nature they

284
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,340
have an ID

285
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,280
they are the start on the other end we

286
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,260
trying to guess which other produce IDs

287
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,990
of the nodes we've seen previously okay

288
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,880
and they also have a ladder so that's

289
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,070
that's where I did here cause that's so

290
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,930
when we're going to use they always have

291
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,560
a level okay notes can available but

292
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,960
it's not computer they can have the same

293
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,600
level for everyone that's good if they

294
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
have different levels then there will be

295
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,750
you know probably index differently but

296
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,220
that depends on the lower lower

297
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,640
underlying server so up to now it's okay

298
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,800
nodes we we're okay lab herbs on the

299
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,330
other hand they are always always

300
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,400
immediately should we put them together

301
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,650
yeah yeah that's important we'll have to

302
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,100
do that

303
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,030
so edge discovery works exactly the same

304
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,580
on top of that ID so values for

305
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,740
everything except for IDs and labels

306
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,270
which are used by the language itself

307
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,970
okay they get the special methods by

308
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,610
himself otherwise when you get an e like

309
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,500
that it's an edge if you get a V it's

310
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,590
and it's a it's a vertex if you get to

311
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,810
know it's nothing and all the way you

312
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,229
get a rail

313
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,340
so shall we put that together yeah now

314
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,200
now we have the edges now we have any

315
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,380
objects the main the meat of gremlin is

316
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,660
of course to navigate through the the

317
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,330
network itself so here is a very complex

318
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,030
network okay so then we we have we have

319
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,040
like four objects and three links I

320
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,040
managed I used the different IDs here so

321
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,510
you can we make the difference I don't

322
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,490
want to say oh this is h1 and this is

323
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,560
linking the vertex one no they're all

324
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,020
different but they're probably if you do

325
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,760
that on your own they will probably have

326
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,410
one two three four and one two three

327
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,280
okay that's that's normal so from the

328
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,310
edge we said we have we have we know the

329
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,650
outgoing link so we can say we can ask

330
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,440
for out V meaning I have on the outgoing

331
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,980
link and I need the vertex and wind up

332
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,630
on two so we say e v if v is this this

333
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:16,410
name the outgoing is the one level okay

334
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,650
if we be on the order on the other side

335
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,960
okay this is for a directed graph by

336
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,820
default on the gremlin graphs are

337
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,030
directed think that there are always a

338
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,890
starting point and an ending point okay

339
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,710
directed or undirected graph so if you

340
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,050
don't care well you just use you know

341
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,450
out just as you like we'll see another

342
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,720
one another one to do the the movement

343
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,960
in the moment and there's a way to do

344
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,450
the migration the movement from any side

345
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,820
so the graph is good but just

346
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,810
information in it so on top of that

347
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,330
flowing following from an edge so we've

348
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,470
seen how to reach the the edges of well

349
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,900
the limits of an edge if you are working

350
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,420
from a node then you will start with the

351
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,610
V and instead of how'd we end

352
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,399
we you'll get directly out out and in

353
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
we'll just say ok if you follow the link

354
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,620
that's going from this link then you'll

355
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,019
go tell me that the Middle East you can

356
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,160
see here from G 1 G 1 the incoming link

357
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,610
the incoming knows from 2 1 are only 4

358
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,370
so I just get one result dizzy yeah I'd

359
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,040
like to see bloody heads on the other

360
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,089
hand right so if you one day out ones

361
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,480
from V coming from the end going outside

362
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,360
now we have two and three and if you

363
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,800
want the wall of them you use both

364
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,190
enough and then you can get the least if

365
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,170
you really want to go inside Ali and

366
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,209
make some checks then you can also

367
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,730
mention the remember when you go inside

368
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,070
the e and we want to go to a V grab out

369
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,089
V and out indeed now if we on V and we

370
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,740
want to go to richer even you change

371
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,589
change the drain here okay now I think

372
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,089
that's that's probably an epiphany when

373
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,860
I when I was starting to work on that

374
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,440
that's the chaining then remember I told

375
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,779
you that well Jesus the start that's

376
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,000
bringing near us no that's bringing us

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,970
another node so actually we could stop

378
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,820
chaining them okay so let's say we want

379
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,550
from the h2 and we want to see what is

380
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,300
the ID of thanks something that is in

381
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,230
and in again okay the first GV I start

382
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,350
with the ID then I go one way and I go

383
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,930
another one and I end up with the number

384
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,970
four and I can change and I can go one

385
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,570
two out V both explodes and start

386
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,240
counting okay I end up with a number

387
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,329
okay so I mention this is the graph this

388
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,880
is a number this is a vertex another

389
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,849
another with the number because he ID

390
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,250
will sell care at that node once I have

391
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,339
found a node at that points of the

392
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,099
traversal I stop and I look into the

393
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,709
node and I get a number I cannot go on

394
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,210
with another in

395
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,790
at that point because it's a number I am

396
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,390
stuck

397
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm in a property there's nothing more I

398
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,380
can do okay we see later how we can

399
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:33,120
extract something in along the way yes

400
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,649
here oh it's just an example we're going

401
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:42,970
to do to move to something that is a

402
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,190
little more I would say business like

403
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,679
okay we're going to new movie inside the

404
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,749
database the WordPress database that's

405
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,519
going to be more interesting there there

406
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,749
you can start thinking that's more

407
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:56,100
example view in yeah it'd be different

408
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,220
so remember you want to have a schema

409
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,989
okay it's kimella is because we don't

410
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,610
have any properties if you want to

411
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,049
remember the wordpress core graph that's

412
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:08,259
what it's going to look like and

413
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,570
actually on top of that I should remove

414
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,690
one of the function right okay because I

415
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,669
tree that we have only function types

416
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,570
and this lick very simple so how come do

417
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:27,970
we end up with that okay I think I got

418
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,789
forty four hundreds function definitions

419
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,980
and I got something like fifty five

420
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,359
thousand cause on the current version

421
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,759
does that make sense

422
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,470
forty yeah for the last for the current

423
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,659
version does it make sense like forty

424
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,409
four hundred functions in WordPress yes

425
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,149
pretty pretty large piece of software

426
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,149
right including all the functions I mean

427
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,919
all the inclusions they are all the

428
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,720
external libraries that make sense

429
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,470
they're using roughly each function is

430
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,989
really is used eleven times

431
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,109
okay so what can we find something

432
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:10,929
interesting in that so first if we just

433
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:15,700
convert no not one call you don't use

434
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,059
all of them all the time right hopefully

435
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,850
what all come to me I'm going to when we

436
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:29,470
configure it so the first yeah this this

437
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,789
if we if we start when yeah

438
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,250
for example yeah it could be it could be

439
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,930
the function is still here what press

440
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,690
itself do not use it but it's still

441
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,250
there because they have previous version

442
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,210
for which they're going to provide

443
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,760
backward compatibility and that's it how

444
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,950
well it's way too early for me to answer

445
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,780
that let's let me think when I when I

446
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,550
reach the point where you can understand

447
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:10,100
sir that I'll ask you there okay no no

448
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,140
for this example now yes there should be

449
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,200
um after me here I I needed a base with

450
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,880
enough data so it could be fun and

451
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,190
interesting in the same time I didn't

452
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,460
check all the PHP special cases so yes

453
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,350
you're right and that was actually my

454
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,210
first slide there is one when they say

455
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,160
okay apply filter and there is a name of

456
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
a function this is not this is not the

457
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,290
case here but we're not going to we're

458
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:44,270
going to use it to navigate so the

459
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,130
simple version if we if we make it we

460
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,870
need larger and just take a few elements

461
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,510
then we have one functions which are

462
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,940
incoming calls so those are the

463
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,760
functions make of this function and they

464
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
may this function in its term echo

465
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
something else okay

466
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,510
so if we want to just you know have a

467
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,450
look at that front on this exact example

468
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,220
again I start with an ID I'm still stuck

469
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,710
with that but that will go away I go out

470
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,070
one two and I get the name so I get

471
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,010
those function names and I can call the

472
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,190
incoming incoming functions on the other

473
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,530
way I'm not using out because this is

474
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,270
directed graph so I know which way they

475
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,740
are calling one function is calling the

476
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,360
other audio the function is being called

477
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,730
I can know all the functions are

478
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,150
occurring VP set password for example by

479
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,140
using the other one just application of

480
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,470
what we've seen okay so now question

481
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,050
would you imagine that word press okay

482
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,680
yeah that's

483
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,820
I don't know what you're talking about

484
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:54,419
no now we're there now we're there you

485
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,509
know what piece the cover that's good

486
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,879
can we detect the number of work per

487
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:05,220
hour or number of them of for press

488
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,259
function that are actually recursive

489
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,360
what is a recursive function in our

490
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,809
graph in and out is the same so that's

491
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,669
interesting we can stop there

492
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,620
get permanent it calls get parents good

493
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,570
but this is not the same so that's not a

494
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,070
recursive function same stuff from the

495
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,350
other way what do we need here we need

496
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,029
to find a function that calls itself

497
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,789
okay that part you know how to move

498
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:32,190
along the graph you know you ub8 you're

499
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,809
able to go very far but you don't know

500
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,629
how to stop so we did it a little few

501
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:40,830
more functions here are two of them what

502
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,909
I have on top you know

503
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,669
well jeebies okay out is okay values

504
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:46,409
okay what you need is two of them which

505
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,610
is as and retain so the one we're

506
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,399
actually needs directly is retain retain

507
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:56,519
is that I will only let things go if

508
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,519
it's my it's the value that is provided

509
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,850
here okay so this is a filter that says

510
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,279
if you give you a list of elements I

511
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,289
will only let those pass and here I need

512
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,779
to tell it which elements have to be

513
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,840
passing so I first name a man so I start

514
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,950
with something for example our stuff

515
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,820
with this one

516
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,940
okay that's myself now I go out there

517
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,039
and I say oh is it myself

518
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,409
no it's not myself because I name this

519
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:27,059
one and I can understand that and that's

520
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,879
it so I stop okay they start again I go

521
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:32,039
there start 30 okay this is this one I

522
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,429
go out here for myself here it's myself

523
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,549
so I can go on and I end up here then I

524
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,690
got my name and I display the name does

525
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,900
that answer the question

526
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,000
okay um I don't remember how many

527
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,420
exactly I found five or six does it make

528
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,890
sense to a recursive friction worpress

529
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,450
of course first why not there's no

530
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,130
reason to be a I just a little

531
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,440
surprising dip and that category Paris

532
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,500
this is for hmm yeah typical use age of

533
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,300
things the things we call each other

534
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,400
well the submenus will call the prayer

535
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:19,990
the parents and the fortune see come on

536
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,290
you've talked together right wait for

537
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:30,110
outside because in between I have to

538
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,290
show you that the one the one we have

539
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,850
done here we said okay we start with

540
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,280
this we follow the call and wind up

541
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,690
there but this is a directed graph and

542
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,580
we can move on the graph the way we

543
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,400
watch okay if we can do that then we can

544
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,340
actually write the same the same query

545
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,090
and believe the same way actually but do

546
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,360
it in with the the in instead of the

547
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,660
house here's the same okay here I call

548
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,250
the origin or I called the following

549
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,970
that's that's the same now you have this

550
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,460
question could you find what I could

551
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,130
ping pong table functions okay it's like

552
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,620
hey oh you have done hey send do that oh

553
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,010
that's interesting but a that's for you

554
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,080
okay pimpin function how can we do that

555
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,540
we need an extra word we need an extra

556
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,300
filter that will actually filter things

557
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,880
that are not ourself okay from what

558
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,470
we've seen already we know everything

559
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,840
except except oh that's a bad transition

560
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,750
thank you to our fallen so we still have

561
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,580
the retain so what we want to do we stop

562
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,400
somewhere we call and we don't want a

563
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,140
recursive function okay a pimple

564
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,880
function is something or two functions

565
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,230
that are sending them each other

566
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,179
probably the same value hopefully not

567
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,120
the same but they are calling each other

568
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,110
hopefully they will stop at some point

569
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,679
right

570
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,080
but we won the first one not to be

571
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,660
himself and on the other way on the way

572
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,060
back we want it to be the same

573
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,970
okay so the first one we stop is 47 we

574
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,010
call it so we know what to compare it

575
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,600
will go out not me again out again me

576
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,740
and then I know my my my answer and this

577
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,580
will give me directly at least two

578
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,310
answers if there are none of them that

579
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,390
will be zero otherwise I will get two of

580
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,060
them but actually not starting back with

581
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,600
that okay anyway if we don't start with

582
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,370
the 47 then we'll get two of them

583
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,950
because if this called last and the

584
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,710
contrary is good

585
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,150
so third guy next question

586
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,300
[Laughter]

587
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,090
so people people functions so I found

588
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,260
fun song if we go on we can do that with

589
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,680
free mm-hmm right yeah yeah that's what

590
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
I used to guess I can do that with four

591
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,010
and I can do that a long time before you

592
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,860
get fed up right so what do we need

593
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,740
there we just we just fight yeah it's

594
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,140
fine is fine I got two of them like that

595
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,100
so so we can actually chain again right

596
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,960
the first one we don't want it the

597
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,550
second one we don't want intercept well

598
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,250
maybe we could actually you know name

599
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,680
name the intermediate one so we don't

600
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,950
end up with recursive functions that

601
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,270
could be an extra thing but that will

602
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,660
probably go out of the of the slide so

603
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,700
we go on we go on that could be nice to

604
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,680
have a loop so yes there are loops there

605
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,350
are built-in gremlin which are

606
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,140
conveniently called repeat they work

607
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,530
with a sub-query so we are going to put

608
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,930
between the parentheses something that

609
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,620
we want to repeat we mentioned times so

610
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,970
we know how many times we want to repeat

611
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,100
that here three times we can also have

612
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,350
an until until some condition is met

613
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,550
this is nice

614
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,140
so this is this first call that that

615
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,920
really shrinks the the size of the query

616
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,149
the other thing we have here is the

617
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,940
it and it itself will just omit anything

618
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,519
that bathroom so as long as I can run

619
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,950
into that the repeat well will repeat

620
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,499
itself okay when it's done the amid will

621
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,690
say okay this value has been fun once I

622
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,169
I give it to you okay

623
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:23,839
if you put in it in the image another

624
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,059
filter except myself well it's already

625
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,009
there but we could put except myself and

626
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,369
not emit the thing okay so we can we can

627
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:33,440
do something in the loop so the the body

628
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,019
of the loop may be complexed and when we

629
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,969
end up the at the end of the loop we can

630
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,039
have another condition for the a meeting

631
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,989
like we don't we just want the end of

632
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,729
the loop or we want to omit anything we

633
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:45,769
want we find in between that's

634
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,229
interesting and you can also put m it

635
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:51,200
here or before then it will start

636
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,940
immediately emitting so it will emit the

637
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,339
first one like a do-while and otherwise

638
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,440
it will just repeat it once no that's

639
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,089
the contrary it would be a while right

640
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,909
and otherwise you can put it behind and

641
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,409
it will just repeat that after art is

642
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:10,549
running it once that's convenient right

643
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:16,549
can you do that you know yeah so what

644
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,839
have you what have we seen up to now

645
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,989
what we've seen the northern but on the

646
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:22,729
vertices we've seen in an out which is

647
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,309
the this backbone of your navigation

648
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,309
you're going to use that Lodge we've

649
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,269
seen a few filters except retain in

650
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,649
without the level that's going to come

651
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:37,429
and the first loop so now we're going to

652
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,629
move to something more interesting it's

653
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:39,589
still waiting for your question right

654
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:42,649
now but basically traversing the graph

655
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,649
is architecture around that we're going

656
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,249
to say if I follow those okay i flow one

657
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,440
when i stop with the node i thought that

658
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,330
that that that's and when i end up there

659
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,210
the war story if it's matching then that

660
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,009
would be my query and i want to extract

661
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:00,529
some data from that that's exactly the

662
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:03,679
the chain i want to find okay i want to

663
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,200
find one query that calls each other

664
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,119
okay that calls itself okay that's

665
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,759
exactly what we're doing you just follow

666
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,649
the path and then at some point mix

667
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:15,229
filters if anything's end up at the end

668
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,380
of the query that's our result

669
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,270
so filtering we've seen a few of them

670
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,490
something's another one that is really

671
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,070
convenient I think I really like that is

672
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,169
that you can actually add the extra

673
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:30,140
level in the in the edge you're moving

674
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,870
on the example is not built for that

675
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,940
because I only have one example which is

676
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,809
one edge which is cool okay imagine that

677
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,850
you have classes instead of functions

678
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,940
okay there will be classes instant

679
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,220
shading there will be inheritance there

680
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,620
will be extensions extends and

681
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,570
implements forever so different

682
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,669
relations between all those tools okay

683
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:55,130
and we can put although all of them into

684
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,049
those and say okay I want to follow and

685
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:59,030
find in an interface I'm just going to

686
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,450
flow implements not extents except if I

687
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,220
start with a node which is itself is an

688
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,049
interface because interface has to be

689
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,809
extended by another interface extending

690
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,820
another interface what classes will be

691
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,799
implementing an interface to different

692
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,280
behavior okay that's a good one if you

693
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,440
have more than one then you can put them

694
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,540
just in a row that will work or so just

695
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,179
the same I'm going to use that alone so

696
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,970
that's kind of needed hmm

697
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,480
no internet so if you want to filter on

698
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,350
vertices there is the else function the

699
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,770
first one says easy does this vertex as

700
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,140
a name whatever it is is it defined did

701
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,030
not know if it's not known that it would

702
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,540
pass okay if it's if it's an owner it

703
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,770
will not pass so it's not defined

704
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,470
otherwise you can put one value you can

705
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,309
ask it for it not to be the value and

706
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,740
those an EQ you are going to see a few

707
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,080
of them or what they call predicates

708
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,929
they look like functions you can apply

709
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:05,360
them so here not equal there is another

710
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,299
one which is equal there is a smaller

711
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,970
lawyers smaller larger things like that

712
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,940
all those operators strangely enough

713
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,799
there is there supposed to be a reg x1

714
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,700
if you want that but I've never seen it

715
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,320
on the Fuji for example it depends on

716
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,510
the server on the underlying server so

717
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,610
there's a few of them but not all of

718
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,070
them within or without

719
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,629
you have a long list of elements you can

720
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:32,149
say okay if the name is been this list

721
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:34,700
and it works but that's that will be

722
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,960
filtering that will be filtering of

723
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,460
nodes let's say let's say we want to

724
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,710
look for dyeing functions functions that

725
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,330
may end up calling VPI okay

726
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,960
what do we get here so notice that we

727
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,489
don't know which are the functions so we

728
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:57,529
start with V I don't put any idea any

729
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:59,539
more okay idea was in here was initially

730
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:00,950
good because I wanted to start from a

731
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,869
point of view that you understand now we

732
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:06,349
just say okay in the world graph any of

733
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,779
the I on any of the verges view follow

734
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,690
one and if must end up on the function

735
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,330
that is called VPI

736
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,359
and then you show me the name what do we

737
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:24,889
get yeah dpi of course what did I what

738
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:27,710
is important here basically the query

739
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,119
looks like that I start with something

740
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,950
anything everything in the that in the

741
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,869
data sets I'll stop I throw something

742
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,929
and I end up with with epi and there I

743
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,759
shall carry on the name by hip the name

744
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,259
of that I really want is the one at the

745
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,799
beginning not at the end right so the

746
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,320
processing is important since we're

747
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,840
cheney's things start things are flowing

748
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,539
through the pipeline and the wall that

749
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:52,669
will query them yeah we have to be

750
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:57,799
careful so how do we do that yeah we run

751
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,349
the other the opposite way so we start

752
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:02,539
with the function that is called VPI

753
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,970
then we go inside and then we find the

754
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,289
name of the function and then we have a

755
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,109
list of interesting things okay so the

756
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,379
graph is K is d going one way but we

757
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,030
don't care we are all the means we need

758
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,690
to do it the way we march okay so let's

759
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,489
let's use it this way okay actually here

760
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,399
for this example it's kind of simple you

761
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,219
could actually end up with you could end

762
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,829
up with that situation initially I use

763
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:33,260
that and I didn't really care about the

764
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,889
the order of the query okay so here we

765
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,290
have the two of them and

766
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,940
tradition with you good friend count

767
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,918
which make sandwiches as you all know

768
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:42,690
right

769
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,040
so it's counting the number of islands

770
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,770
and I stopped miss V God cool and up

771
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,630
with me Pete I count four eighty four if

772
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,130
I do the other one the other way I also

773
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,710
get eighty four because count just end

774
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,480
up counting the number of things that go

775
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,880
through it so it don't care if it's

776
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,410
seven at the same time okay

777
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,630
we will it was nothing laughable for us

778
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,920
to end up with all the name the names

779
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,650
because they were all the same but there

780
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,840
are actually different results they

781
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,210
found another way to end up on VP die

782
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,220
and that's how we need to do it to count

783
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,000
so at that point one thing you want to

784
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,260
make if you want to make the difference

785
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,040
is by adding it up now dee da mm-hmm can

786
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,020
you guess hmm they duplicate yeah I have

787
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,480
no idea why the hell they only decided

788
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,670
to have this one as abbreviated not me

789
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,390
usually they have long you know human

790
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,520
readable name okay and the first time I

791
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,220
got that like did up it's like what this

792
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:46,270
is not okay yeah then duplication so I

793
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,370
think there's another unique okay um I

794
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,480
answer that okay I think we'd see that

795
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,960
later

796
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,370
then we'll there is a little problem for

797
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,020
that maybe that they duplicate will be

798
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,760
the same origin I don't know but this is

799
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,230
the only one that's that has any prayer

800
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,660
abbreviation so here I say okay

801
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,430
good a function you follow you and upon

802
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,770
VD that you did up so you only allow one

803
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,890
instance of an object that's that has

804
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,630
been rich that has reached this point

805
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,190
and then you count and of course we end

806
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,340
up with one okay so no variety on the

807
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,470
other hand if we do the same we several

808
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,900
of them then you have 84 the I wonder if

809
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,940
the usage of did up as a really ugly

810
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,890
name is not made for one good reason

811
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,620
here it's a beautiful name

812
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,780
is that your hand maybe that happens I

813
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,610
here what happens is that we skip

814
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,830
everything we follow whenever and I we

815
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,840
actually end up with 84 elements we just

816
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,630
say okay I just want one so we do a lot

817
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,180
of work we unearth we find everything

818
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,310
and then we end up on that on this one

819
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,190
it's not

820
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,900
streamlined because we just find the one

821
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,880
we want for the ones and the first heat

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,740
gives up directly or the results we want

823
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,180
we know we don't need the deed up it's

824
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,130
completely useless and we just

825
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,890
manipulated 84 data here if you have a

826
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,740
million line I mean you're 92 analyzed

827
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,450
that's going to be a lot longer so

828
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,960
anytime you start using did up what you

829
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,650
have to be faster so on top of that we

830
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,810
work with some counting so here is the

831
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,930
account um there are a bunch of function

832
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,329
interesting limits okay like an SQL

833
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:23,990
branch is the SQL limit but with the

834
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,630
beginning and the end okay so you can

835
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,300
get the numbers tail for just the ends

836
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,990
so that's interesting

837
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,420
there is coin or so which is nice just

838
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,369
going to make a sample of that just

839
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:37,190
completely arbitrary and random okay the

840
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,020
number we have here is a person page so

841
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,569
we get basically a person's of the

842
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,940
elements which means that you can you

843
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,980
can make you want to test the query you

844
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,940
don't want to run it on the wall

845
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,180
database directly coin it will just make

846
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,530
number of there like once in a while

847
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,440
just going to give you a few data so

848
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,470
dying functions back to the start what

849
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,920
do we need just rewards it to introduce

850
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,650
you with my good friend selects we've

851
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,930
seen again there's the the ass remember

852
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,300
okay so I still use them out because

853
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,150
it's interesting what happens is I give

854
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,829
a name of the element that's interesting

855
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:15,349
me I go out do some checks when I'm done

856
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:18,260
whyever I end up in the graph then I say

857
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,680
okay

858
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,589
select start if you reach that point if

859
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:24,170
from there you can go out find a with

860
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,290
epi then when you're done stop come back

861
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,740
and get the furthest thing called start

862
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,310
by name okay so the key word here is

863
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,800
select select will actually at any point

864
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,770
in the query will move the cursor if we

865
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,500
combat move it again to a place that has

866
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,480
been named a place you've been there so

867
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,210
you can you know go find out for an

868
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,400
interesting note go away come back go

869
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,589
another way come back do a third way on

870
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,630
the end of there and in the same time

871
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,950
collect lots of interesting information

872
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:59,309
okay by here is not accurate functions

873
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,349
it depends on the previous method may

874
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,539
select there are a few others which

875
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:06,119
Linda mentioned by heart now but select

876
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,719
will say first name will be displayed by

877
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,479
name so I mentioned a property will

878
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,309
display that property I can actually say

879
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,099
stop start mention two of them and have

880
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,929
two different properties selected from

881
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,749
there or I could select several values

882
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:23,880
give them different names and each time

883
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,589
select ok the first one by name the

884
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:28,169
second one by ID the third one by I

885
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:28,819
don't know

886
00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:31,650
extension whatever whatever that means

887
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,650
so select and ours actually work a lot

888
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,890
better than that we've seen ok yeah

889
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,109
that's it exactly what I'm explaining so

890
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:47,969
um let's imagine 10 minutes ok let's

891
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:48,809
finish with this one

892
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:52,589
the sub-queries ok here he's getting a

893
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,479
little strange I'm trying to look for

894
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:58,799
functions that are calling both escaped

895
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:02,429
escapes HTML and VP dad so someone that

896
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:04,469
probably programmed preparing some error

897
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,630
messages and then we've actually pushed

898
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,079
that to VP doesn't there that so since

899
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,239
we are from what we've seen ok we start

900
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,179
with the name we go on the first one has

901
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,799
no constant but that will be our result

902
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:18,569
so we'd name it ok we don't care about

903
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,969
the what's a little bit that that's

904
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,039
another way we go out check the other

905
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,599
function call and then we select the

906
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,999
results so we know exactly the one we

907
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:30,089
get from the middle right the order of

908
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:32,640
processing is from here because we start

909
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,099
initially with the VP die and when we

910
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,559
end up wind up with the SK escape is

911
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,479
dinner right so we do not we do not

912
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,729
start from where we watch and we do not

913
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,289
end up again where were from where world

914
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,419
we just have to you select to put to

915
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,209
move everything back to the right place

916
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:50,669
unless of course you use higher-level

917
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:53,219
gremlin there is another function call

918
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,209
where which allows you to do sub queries

919
00:40:57,209 --> 00:41:00,000
so you've moved on the main

920
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,790
the main graph and at that point you

921
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,710
don't want to divert and have grimian go

922
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,090
somewhere if we just want to do a little

923
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,040
check on the side okay that's exactly

924
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,780
where he where say stop and go out find

925
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,300
a call if there is a VP die okay if you

926
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,390
find something where anything remember

927
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,870
load an edge repeat where will be happy

928
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,030
will be considered a true if it doesn't

929
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,070
find anything end up with a no then it

930
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,530
will be false and we'll stop okay so

931
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,070
basically I can now start from anywhere

932
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,470
here deuce I go to VP that oh I found it

933
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,150
so I'll go back and of course we can do

934
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,330
the same for the other one okay and that

935
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,940
will now look like that oh and that's a

936
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,330
Miss that should be a in right that

937
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,210
should be in whether he'll do I have to

938
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,860
add that that would be answering the

939
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,670
question about dedup forcibly for out

940
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,380
actually that's another that's another

941
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,510
typo I just start with out and that goes

942
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,850
that goes while on the other hand when I

943
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,170
start here I have to start with

944
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,750
underscore underscore underscore NASCAR

945
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,030
represent the current node okay which

946
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,170
could make sense here I could use

947
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,580
underscore underscore but here as a

948
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,550
sugar syntax out of meetings here and

949
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,020
that's something that's really presently

950
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,540
when you really see that initially is

951
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,000
that because what that should be in here

952
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,990
in is actually a keyword for movie who

953
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,710
the hell is groovy I mean did I mention

954
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,900
that up to now yeah you have to show me

955
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,830
another five minutes right yeah actually

956
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,280
this this edge is written on groovy so

957
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,560
most of the code we have here we have a

958
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,570
programming language will be based on

959
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,280
groovy and groovy as a keyword which is

960
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,560
in so we cannot start directly within it

961
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,750
doesn't have a keyword come out so

962
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,970
starting without is okay but starting

963
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,800
with in is it is not possible so we have

964
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,240
to underscore use underscore underscore

965
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,330
this is there where we start seeing the

966
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,610
limit between the the language the

967
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,050
gremlin language and the other line

968
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,630
there will be I think they just

969
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,150
published a sip implementation of

970
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,250
gremlin so possibly in this see

971
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,650
experimentation in will not be a key

972
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,770
word and that we flow so suddenly the

973
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,330
standard is not exactly the

974
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:18,660
same for everyone let's finish if you

975
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,030
want oh yeah our good friend Council if

976
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,850
you want to use aware and end up with

977
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,240
something that is a negative negative

978
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,250
assertion then use count and you make it

979
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,440
equal to zero and that's probably

980
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,750
another typo so let's finish with that

981
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,950
that's the freudian when you're writing

982
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,220
a career with this language you think

983
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,100
about the way you want to traverse then

984
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,690
you think about the different concern

985
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,880
conditions you have it may be on the

986
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,530
node it may be on the side maybe a

987
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,410
little back trip a side trip in the end

988
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,710
you mark in red the one you won't report

989
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,860
it and that's how you end up with a with

990
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,440
a quadrant grinning query yeah so to

991
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,280
finish I'm sorry I'm going to jump that

992
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,470
there's filter which we see we start

993
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,730
using actually groovy code okay in the

994
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,130
closures and there's a very interesting

995
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,940
group Group group count group by just

996
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,290
the same as in it's clear but there's a

997
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,510
group count what I really enjoyed with

998
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,400
that is that you can have several route

999
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,840
counts in the same query because

1000
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,460
actually the group count is just a

1001
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,830
counter it just okay I get a node I get

1002
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,780
a specification in it I know what I want

1003
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,090
I want to count the names of of the

1004
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,650
function so I collect that and I put

1005
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,480
that in an array but I can do something

1006
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,130
with that right so I just show that to

1007
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,420
the next one and the next one is another

1008
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,610
group count which is now counting the

1009
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,380
number of times this function is being

1010
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,200
called and I end up with one result in

1011
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,030
two different group count at the same

1012
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:56,070
time that's interesting so PHP and

1013
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,090
gremlin okay well first of all you can

1014
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,440
see the pitch feels a lot better at

1015
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,130
logos than them please before gremlin

1016
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,160
there is compare do not do not mistake

1017
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,130
that with pong it's completely different

1018
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,520
right yeah yeah great Gregory so this

1019
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,450
one is perfect rim in PHP it's on it's

1020
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,370
on the composer so okay composer in

1021
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,100
style you have it there's there's a lot

1022
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,470
of old stuff for great

1023
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,270
to make sure you start working Bremen in

1024
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,640
three criming - is completely dead but

1025
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,950
there's lots of servers running with it

1026
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,380
so make sure that the one you choose is

1027
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,720
the one running for example or MDB which

1028
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,040
only mentioned in a moment it's still

1029
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,680
running grinning - it is not what I've

1030
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,720
shown here and they are going to move to

1031
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,520
sublime in three it's in the way but

1032
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,650
it's not done okay so just make sure

1033
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,390
when you make your choice that grimming

1034
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,799
three is the one that is being supported

1035
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,150
otherwise from the orgy there's a

1036
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,030
plug-in which use a REST API how does

1037
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,080
that look like require once use

1038
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,210
connection with the grow the host and

1039
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,180
the graph being used open sand get the

1040
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,420
results close someone hadn't understood

1041
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,920
okay so that's very simple from PHP

1042
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,560
point of view it's very simple I said

1043
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,470
that the meat of the perennial queries

1044
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,140
rebuilding them okay maybe fetching a

1045
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,180
number of information from your own PHP

1046
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,340
before putting that in the query with

1047
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,800
the usual injection problems unless well

1048
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,960
no one's know how to use it running so

1049
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,300
maybe we're safe for a moment but that

1050
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,470
will happen okay so here the version is

1051
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,920
3 there is gremlin initially I think it

1052
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,750
was there's one of those product it was

1053
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,880
initially one two three four five

1054
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,640
projects okay five different project

1055
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,130
that were processing different part of

1056
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,740
the graph and the most they from version

1057
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,089
zero to perversion three you skip the

1058
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:57,589
ten minutes thank you

1059
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:00,830
so they did each time each each

1060
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,720
iteration one of the project was merged

1061
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,790
into and finally it's only grimmy so

1062
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,400
just look for gremlin or you can call

1063
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,440
that it's called currently called tinker

1064
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,020
pop okay it's an incubator on Apache you

1065
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,290
will find the information there now I

1066
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,240
like say grabbing runs on different

1067
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,670
databases I don't know if mr. Omari

1068
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,430
Odaiba done it the guy who wrote Remy

1069
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,920
wrote Titan so the integration is pretty

1070
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,720
tight that's a good one

1071
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,270
the stable ones I use for grimly from

1072
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,820
neo4j but nobody is running this

1073
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,300
show with cypher so initially like when

1074
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,220
I came Gremio for here were very good

1075
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,140
friends and that's it was easy to set up

1076
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,170
okay I have to admit that I came to them

1077
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,170
with that nowadays more and more they're

1078
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,940
separated so it's getting more and more

1079
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,680
difficult to use no Fuji from gremlin

1080
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,460
and vice versa but it still works so

1081
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,420
it's okay

1082
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,300
startup I don't know Tinka pop as a

1083
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,980
server by themself in the register is

1084
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:02,750
the old server from Grameen - okay one

1085
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,220
thing you have to understand there is a

1086
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,160
server the server itself may be the one

1087
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,480
that installs the sir the the underlying

1088
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,940
servers okay so there's a gremlin

1089
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,970
servers that you will have you will tell

1090
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:19,250
it ok in style Titan DB and you will be

1091
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,310
using Titan dB at the beginning it's a

1092
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,720
little confusing you're expecting to be

1093
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,340
grimian on top of that it's not the

1094
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,600
contrary there is a remanent server

1095
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,060
which turns the query into something

1096
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,510
that's there lying server understand

1097
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,970
that's the way it works ok so basically

1098
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,470
you have to download the server the

1099
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,300
console which we will be using to input

1100
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,490
your your data and the server itself

1101
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,310
will run there is an easy install from

1102
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,230
from them all in command line and you

1103
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,940
have to use this come back and there are

1104
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,490
these well thank you for staying with me

1105
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,950
I understand well we have to go right

1106
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,849
yeah three minutes for questions but I'm

1107
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:08,320
staying here so if you want some more

1108
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:22,869
answers I be able to answer yeah okay

1109
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:26,050
I'm going to say no I'm going to say no

1110
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,390
the reason is a gremlin is the top-level

1111
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,119
language and it's actually relaying on

1112
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,310
the server to do the actual performance

1113
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,950
thing so let me give you a negative of

1114
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:42,390
any time we have a query somewhere

1115
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,839
that's not that's not in z1 okay any

1116
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:48,520
time I start with that for example based

1117
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,980
on never 4G for example just behind

1118
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,839
instead of in and out I make a lot I

1119
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,910
make a level check okay I check if my

1120
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,160
node is of a certain type I have

1121
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,160
different types of them the thing is the

1122
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,170
graving did not do any optimization for

1123
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,050
that so it just okay how about good and

1124
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,579
it shows that we will know for the new

1125
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,680
Fergie on the other hand the first issue

1126
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,920
is that also why happen index for that

1127
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,430
house rule yes then a check I have no

1128
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,190
way to create the index using Brandon

1129
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,720
because when you do not understand the

1130
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,930
index concerns I am you rely on cypher

1131
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,810
so not I setup the database I call

1132
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,790
cypher to build index and then it will

1133
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,369
be used but from grabbing those there is

1134
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:32,349
no tool that will tell you okay you

1135
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:34,030
should do this way or you can do another

1136
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,200
one

1137
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,230
the other trick I use is as usual which

1138
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,510
that erases the less amount of data I

1139
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,119
manipulates the better it is

1140
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,700
okay so after the GB for example or

1141
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,670
first check I put a counter okay I

1142
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,829
mentioned you can include the closure

1143
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:53,230
okay groovy

1144
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,400
so I usually no side effects

1145
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,230
show that but there's side effect so I

1146
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,660
run a little counter and when I'm done

1147
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,059
at the end I end up with another counter

1148
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,069
say okay here is the number of data I

1149
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,869
processed here is number of that's out

1150
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,660
that I have India when I have too many

1151
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,369
of them then I usually go back and say

1152
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,170
okay is there a way that I can make that

1153
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,049
so faster but at that point no there is

1154
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:16,880
this is the the problem of the

1155
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,010
separation of this standard and the

1156
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:24,250
implementation sorry for the long answer
