1
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,960
it can anyone hear me at the back is

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,470
okay

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,660
I like cool I can see hands over the

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,689
back side there we go so let me just

5
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,710
adjust this

6
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,660
so Who am I as I said it's a Peter

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,210
suitor my senior pro service engineer at

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,030
puppet labs I've been a puppet for two

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,760
years have been using puppet for I say

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,350
close to six years now it says five on

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,440
there but yeah so i i'm a senior pro

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,790
service engineer so i work with

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,879
customers i do stuff like this so i do

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,960
talks and things like that but i also

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,570
work in the community and i like opening

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,500
pull requests on modules i use so I

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,820
should give a quick warning before I

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,509
start is that I speak quite quickly even

19
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:09,810
now like the brain power to make sure

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,950
that in sweida my normal speed was like

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,960
this it's like taking up half my brain

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,399
and remembering my slides of the other

23
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,380
half so if I go too fast

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,090
someone just wave or you know just say

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,319
slow down and I'll see if I can calm

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,740
down myself out of it and also I should

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,119
probably put this disclaimer up as the

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,280
as someone who is not a lawyer or an

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,890
auditor or you know signed an NDA if

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,569
your company or anything like that make

31
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,130
sure that anything I advise in here you

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,690
don't just tell you hopefully you should

33
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,039
need to be warned about something like

34
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,080
this but it does happen

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,759
don't just take the stuff I'm talking

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,869
about and just go and implement with

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,340
your company without talking to someone

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,719
who knows what they're talking about

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,149
first so why are we here Sherpa in the

40
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,399
room who has to deal with some sort of

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,060
compliance at their company oh it's a

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,860
lot of people so it makes sense cuz it's

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,649
the color court so white compliance and

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,840
what does it actually mean so it's a

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,090
pretty good definition here from the

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,460
computer weekly website basically

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,038
compliance the TLDR is that there is

48
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,619
some sort of legal obligation or not

49
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,850
always legal sometimes it's just an

50
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,549
agreement like a framework but basically

51
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:15,930
someone has told you that there are set

52
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,380
of rules that you need to follow and

53
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,049
this is a kind of a side thing here but

54
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,420
it's an important though that compliance

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,459
is not security or more accurately

56
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,040
compliance doesn't directly correlate

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,890
security it's a part of a secure kind of

58
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,870
framework you have your company but just

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,489
because something is compliant doesn't

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,900
mean it's going to be secure it might

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,859
help but it's not just that

62
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
and a good explanation and I'll put a

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,190
link to this blog post later on is

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,000
basically compliance is the

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,140
there's a plane and verification of

66
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,980
scale because the the general idea is

67
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,630
that if you think about your system if

68
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,580
you had to document every single like

69
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,930
file that's on there and how they're

70
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,100
working it's gonna be pretty difficult

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,200
so compliance is basically a framework

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,570
around making sure that at your company

73
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,040
you've got an agreed-upon kind of

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,380
framework for how you're doing things

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,260
and as people who probably put their

76
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,480
hand up and so who in so people put

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,250
their hand up for compliance put your

78
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,040
hand up is the compliance or sort of

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,660
like stuff you have to do your company

80
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,830
just gets thrown over the wall at the

81
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,400
last minute there's a few hands there

82
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,150
okay

83
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,620
so the thing about compliance is it

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,940
often kind of straddles different

85
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,190
organizational silos at least with some

86
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,390
of the customers I've worked with

87
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,000
compliance is sometimes literally there

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,920
is a compliance team which is separate

89
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,300
from the security team which is separate

90
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,860
from the operations team which is bad

91
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,630
generally you know the whole point of

92
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,190
DevOps is it's not just a buzzword it's

93
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,450
for everyone to kind of work together on

94
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,370
the same team but because of that

95
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,930
compliance often ends up being thrown

96
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,520
over the wall to the last minute you

97
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,660
know someone just comes in and goes oh I

98
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,340
ran an esse scan across your network you

99
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,080
need to fix all this stuff and that kind

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,370
of stuff need to be brought left you

101
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,060
know brought into your kind of workplace

102
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,170
but regardless of you know what the

103
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,060
definition compliance is or if you even

104
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,620
want to do it a lot of times you don't

105
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,150
get the choice and someone's told you

106
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,390
that you need to follow the rules so

107
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,830
there's now for that soup of all the

108
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,480
various acronyms and things that you

109
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,010
need to follow there these are quite

110
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,420
American bias because a lot of the

111
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,549
research online is American bias but the

112
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,660
one that you probably recognized from up

113
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,430
there if you I vote if you're not

114
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,988
American or you're working in Europe

115
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,079
we're going to be PCI DSS maybe ITIL and

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,120
some others stake maybe if you're doing

117
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
work in these states

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,120
there's a bunch up there and even if

119
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
you're not following any sort of

120
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,120
governmental compliance or legal kind of

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,470
requirements you might have compliance

122
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,910
based on an agreed-upon framework

123
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,460
internally so you might just have a set

124
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,570
of what you know most people call

125
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,460
hardening policies so they're not

126
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,380
directly correlated to you know some

127
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,000
governmental standard but they're just

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,290
like this is what we need to do to get

129
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,979
stuff working at our company and in that

130
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,150
this is one that comes up quite a lot

131
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,770
the center Center for Internet Security

132
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,960
it's basically a kind of

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,990
non-governmental fork of the stig

134
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,580
standards but it is fairly popular

135
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,960
because a lot of you know banks and

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,139
stuff they

137
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,580
scared of using something like stick

138
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,499
because it explicitly made by companies

139
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,360
you know organizations like the NSA and

140
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,409
they're a bit worried about that kind of

141
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:08,659
stuff so this is like the CIS is the

142
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,490
kind of more business-friendly version

143
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,409
of it but essentially a lot of those and

144
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,419
we'll see later on a lot of those CIS

145
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,430
what other compliance standards are

146
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,229
pretty similar to stick if not the same

147
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,569
yeah I got a reason to say I so popular

148
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:25,789
is that it covers a lot of stuff so the

149
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,050
huge list there if you can pretty move

150
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,430
to see most of things that you can think

151
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,219
of you know FreeBSD very Microsoft

152
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,699
various databases Amazon Linux and

153
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:35,779
things like that you know it covers a

154
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,550
lot of different areas that are so the

155
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,169
thing about compliance is that another

156
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,639
good note on compliance is that

157
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,259
sometimes it doesn't directly correlate

158
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,330
to actual technical requirements you

159
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,949
have to dig through a lot of legalese to

160
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,389
actually find something you can work on

161
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,219
directly with code so an example is the

162
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:58,460
HIV HIPAA which is basically just in

163
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,650
American law around health insurance in

164
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,879
the States so this is the actual text of

165
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,120
the requirements around that so if you

166
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,050
look at something like that and if you

167
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,370
actually go to that website you have the

168
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,550
full like because the whole compliance

169
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,279
stuff around HIPAA is basically it was

170
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,750
written for senators and for lawmakers

171
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,009
and stuff like that so you have to take

172
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,360
this document that's in legalese and

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,740
drill down to what you actually do

174
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,539
though so if we go through that we need

175
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,469
to look at 45 CFR part 60 and parts a

176
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:30,469
and C apart one six four so let's go and

177
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,080
do that so you have a bunch of headlines

178
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,689
like this and you know if you're bored

179
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:36,979
maybe you go through a single one of

180
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,810
them looking for so the bit you probably

181
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,199
care about this bear here the technical

182
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,050
safeguards so tender people safeguard

183
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,439
seems like something that we care about

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,250
so these are the technical safeguards

185
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,839
and some of these are more kind of

186
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,689
engineering problems and some of them

187
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,710
can't really be covered by conflict

188
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,770
management

189
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,340
so some of these will be directly config

190
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,630
management tools and some of these will

191
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,520
be may be installed by configure

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,290
management tools so the idea that you

193
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,850
have to have you know specific logins

194
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,860
and you have auditability maybe you

195
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,060
can't do that with your config

196
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,430
management but an LDAP tool that then

197
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,140
logs into some sort of you know syslog

198
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,040
or something like that would you then

199
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,140
toward it so your company management

200
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,280
tool helps with that but it can't work

201
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,150
directly and basically the the level of

202
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,260
compliance you can give and the

203
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,120
difficulty you have with compliance is

204
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,340
directly correlated with how friendly or

205
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,750
how kind of adversarial you are with

206
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,370
your auditors because the end of the day

207
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,660
the auditors are the ones that actually

208
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,550
decide whether you're in compliance or

209
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,370
not so depending on how you're auditing

210
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,750
is being done whether it's an internal

211
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,610
team or an external team you ultimately

212
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,220
have to work with them and it can be an

213
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,720
adversarial relationship but it's a bad

214
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,790
idea because as I said they're the ones

215
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,830
that hold you're sort of the key to

216
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,240
actually getting signed off so it's good

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,050
to work with them on this kind of stuff

218
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm probably problem of this is that a

219
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,870
lot of time compliance the manual

220
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,430
process especially if you are in a

221
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,630
company that hasn't gone through this

222
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,910
kind of DevOps kind of transformation or

223
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,260
any sort of agile transformation there

224
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,480
you a lot of these processes are being

225
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,580
kept in emails or in PDFs or even dead

226
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,110
trees you've got you know I've seen

227
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,120
pictures of here is our compliance stack

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,190
and it's just a stack of paper this big

229
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,900
if someone's printed off the sticks then

230
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,810
it's something like that or the worst

231
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,950
story to information which is humans

232
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,140
because you know Cubans are an unsolved

233
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,360
problem in IT it's very hard to get

234
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,710
information from one human to another a

235
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,840
lot of time especially if you're in the

236
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,890
adversarial kind of a relationship there

237
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,510
so you know put my best infomercial

238
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,610
voice there's got to be a better way so

239
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,960
if you think about it what is IT

240
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,059
compliance is a series of rules for

241
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,410
systems that need to be enforced and

242
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,540
reported on and what is configuration

243
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,950
management it's a series of rules for

244
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,600
systems that need to be enforced and

245
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,900
reported on so we can use config

246
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,910
management tools for this stuff and if

247
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,630
you're here you probably have very

248
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,750
experience with this so what's the

249
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,600
advantage of actually doing that we've

250
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,580
got reduced in top cost and time per

251
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,590
release you know automating stuff makes

252
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,140
things better it means that you have a

253
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,550
sort of creed upon standard for things

254
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,030
you've got the idea of sharing every

255
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,000
youth and I'm gonna talk about like the

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,380
size Newton once said you need to stand

257
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,760
on the shoulders of giants a lot of

258
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,990
people have already done the work for

259
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,430
you you don't have to tell the stuff all

260
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,570
over again

261
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,090
and for example DDS the government

262
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,250
digital service in the UK they open

263
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,060
source all their work because

264
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,620
technically taxpayer money is going

265
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,870
towards all this code so they try and

266
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,400
open source as much as possible and then

267
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,200
you know they've already done the work

268
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,460
for you there's no point having to do it

269
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,670
again

270
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,600
yeah you have a single source of truth

271
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,490
if you have compliance as code then you

272
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,840
have a single place you can go look for

273
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,550
it instead of having to dig for a bunch

274
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,900
of emails and talk to a bunch of people

275
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,180
and I at one point I had no argument

276
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,860
about semantics but more accurately is

277
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,570
less arguments about semantics because

278
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,190
if you've got a knack read upon standard

279
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,530
a DSL the main cific language you can

280
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,970
you don't have to argue about like oh

281
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,500
what you do this we've said or we do a

282
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,230
fork and that kind of stuff nice you're

283
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,610
arguing about semantics yeah and as I

284
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,660
said a lot of the requirements for these

285
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,130
compliance standards some of them aren't

286
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,650
actually technological things so if we

287
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,270
go back to the HIPAA standards and their

288
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,470
some of them were stuff like you need a

289
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,600
security guard outside of your data

290
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,770
center and that kind of stuff you

291
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,270
unfortunately we can't automate that

292
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,870
stuff yet so the more time you have to

293
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,340
get rid of the technical stuff the more

294
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,830
you can sort of push the soft skill

295
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,220
stuff away so how does it actually look

296
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,480
like in action let's to pick a really

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,710
basic example on how we would actually

298
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,020
do this with company management tools so

299
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,120
talking about the CIS standards you can

300
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,190
actually go and get the COS benchmarks

301
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,080
there so we're going to talk about the

302
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,640
central 7 machine and here's central 7

303
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,980
rule 1 2 3 I just picked the most basic

304
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,660
one just to show because I'm going to

305
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,300
talk about one given both face example

306
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,500
as I can obvious is going to be more

307
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,350
complex ones but the TLDR of this is

308
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,620
that you should have GPT check keeping

309
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,240
checking with one if you're a Red Hat

310
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,980
system and you want the standards cuz

311
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,780
hopefully your packages should be signed

312
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,410
and you could you sign

313
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,930
but it's not the greatest color there

314
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,550
but you can see there's a really basic

315
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,410
example of how to do in puppet you know

316
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,250
there's a million ways you can do this

317
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,690
you can use all gifts you could use an

318
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,580
actual we can manage the entire file but

319
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,470
to make things simple I'm just me use a

320
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,480
file line and if you're not meeting with

321
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,830
a puppet this is basically gonna red X

322
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,480
look the key PT check one if it's there

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
if it's there something else is going to

324
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,870
change it my way and again as I said I

325
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,730
work for puppet I'm gonna try and be as

326
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,350
bipartisan as possible and give the

327
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,530
other examples so there might be some

328
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,310
chef people out in the audience to

329
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,510
probably say there's a bow of doing this

330
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,740
but this is just the first one I could

331
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,110
find so similar thing usually replace

332
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,940
the rad resource and then go through and

333
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,270
look for DPG check and then similar in

334
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,100
salt look through the young calm look at

335
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,590
upp check and similar ad support and as

336
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,940
I said no put the hand up and say

337
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,720
there's actually a better way of doing

338
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,430
this because a most experienced with

339
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,750
puppet I just went for the most basic

340
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,950
solution that kind of illustrates what

341
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,310
you're doing

342
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,769
so one of the things that comes up a lot

343
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,540
so I think first services so one of the

344
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,430
resort basic requirements of puppet for

345
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,870
Pro Services is someone's come along and

346
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,550
told us that we need to be you know PCI

347
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,680
compliant something like that and they

348
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,629
want some coffee managing to do it and

349
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,100
there's a few different approaches to

350
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,449
how you actually use conflict management

351
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,540
to do this so one would be you already

352
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,180
have a bunch of config management code

353
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,040
and then you basically just make sure

354
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,149
that that code you've already written

355
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,610
gives you the compliance you need so for

356
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,079
example I'm going to be a puppet example

357
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
here for that young check if you had

358
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,560
before maybe you already have a young

359
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,120
module that you've got and you just go

360
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,500
in there and change the parameter make

361
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
sure that your PT check equals one so

362
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,740
that's the and that's the method I

363
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,000
recommend the most you should be using

364
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,790
the existing calling that you've got but

365
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,290
I talked about silos earlier on

366
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,009
sometimes

367
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,589
someone's primary use case for

368
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,600
compliance and config management is just

369
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,790
for compliance or nothing else they just

370
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,139
want to use this tool maybe they've got

371
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,459
a different tool and they're using this

372
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,199
just for this one area so in that case

373
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,269
you might use a dedicated CIF module or

374
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,649
Steve module or something like that and

375
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,800
then you actually use it for that way

376
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,660
and a lot of people end up using some

377
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,889
sort of if they're using their

378
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,230
compliance tooling as a scanner as well

379
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,850
so not just enforcing it or maybe they

380
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,050
can't enforce it cuz again they're very

381
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,089
siloed maybe they've got a change freeze

382
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,199
but they need to scan through your

383
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,569
system most config management tools have

384
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,160
some sort of dry run mode and puppets

385
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,029
know up in chef it's try run in ansible

386
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,459
I think it's dry run anyone is it dry

387
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,130
run oh that's cool check just check the

388
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,660
asset and then I think there's anyone

389
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,339
salt in the room is there with dry run

390
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,550
and salt testing is cool true ok next

391
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,189
thing so some people you know if they're

392
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,389
in a siloed place or somewhere where

393
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:58,459
they can't easily they're moving on that

394
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,019
journey and they can't easily just run

395
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,309
stuff on their systems they can run

396
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,600
stuff in a dry run mode and go through

397
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,889
that so the few approaches you can do

398
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,160
here and remember we talked about

399
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,050
sharing reuse we don't have to write all

400
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,309
this stuff all over again because lots

401
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,850
of people don't for us the ones out

402
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,040
there is dev sector IO is just a website

403
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,079
where there's been a bunch of code

404
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,769
written in chef puppet and ansible lots

405
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,149
of pre-existing stuff of this and

406
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:25,339
they're not perfect again you know as

407
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,380
you said need to find something and

408
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,939
don't use an input media implemented it

409
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:29,590
there's some common

410
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,820
on there saying this doesn't follow that

411
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,410
in the right way but there's some good

412
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,550
stuff out there and there's a lot of

413
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,230
existing code that you can use so that's

414
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,920
deficit that I oh so there's simp the

415
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,720
system integrity management platform

416
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,570
this is a kind of is an entire stack

417
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,090
written by onyx point so this was

418
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,100
something that they built for the NSA

419
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,900
and for an American government systems

420
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,820
the idea is that the simp stack is

421
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,670
puppet with a bunch of pre-written

422
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,530
modules that follow the simplest

423
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,210
standards over in the states will be at

424
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,890
NFA standards and then they have some

425
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,530
cool stuff on top they're actually got

426
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,050
some really cool kind of higher at all

427
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,460
that will go through and it will

428
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,740
actually write compliance logs and write

429
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,970
those kind of reports that were your

430
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,710
compliance people like HTML reports that

431
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,940
say this is what's changed from the

432
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,130
puppet run you just had and a lot some

433
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,330
of that stuff is in public yet if you

434
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,720
talk to Trevor born on the puppet slack

435
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,010
in the security room he'll talk about

436
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,770
that stuff one way this ends will be

437
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,270
locked and again this is just some quick

438
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,980
bruising as I said I mainly puppet and

439
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm trying to be bipartisan as possible

440
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,070
if there's level stuff come and talk to

441
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,180
me afterwards so I can add in for next

442
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,570
time

443
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,760
the danceable lockdown Mansel partnered

444
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,080
up with a security partner and they

445
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,000
wrote some I think these have sitting

446
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,890
yeah these are the stig standards so

447
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,840
they've written some pre-written play

448
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,890
books for the stick standards and for

449
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,730
all the stuff you go in the community

450
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,380
hubs if you go to the Falls you go for

451
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,120
the cookbooks you get the galaxy if you

452
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,770
look up like a CIA source dig

453
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,000
lots of people have written this code

454
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,940
before you so don't write all the stuff

455
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,530
yourself if you have to try new

456
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,640
something that someone's read before and

457
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,480
for kitten

458
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,720
however there's a two parter compiler to

459
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,430
IT compliance there the enforcement and

460
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,480
then there's reporting so conflict

461
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
management can be used for both but I

462
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,010
tend to saw say that you want to use the

463
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,300
config management part for the enforcing

464
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,700
and use a separate tool for reporting

465
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,320
and there's a few reasons for that one

466
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,090
is that as you said some of the stuff

467
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,500
can't be caught with config managers

468
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,150
much the other thing is that a certain

469
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,850
standard yeah so for certain standards

470
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,980
there are what are known as ASVs so for

471
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,170
certain compliance standards only people

472
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,490
that have been officially given this or

473
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,960
kosher stamp like this is the thing you

474
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,850
can do can do that so sometimes you

475
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,170
can't use puppet or chef or whatever

476
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,550
because it's not been signed off yet

477
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,390
and a third player is we're at FOSDEM so

478
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,640
the sad part is there's not as many open

479
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,110
source versions of compliance tools

480
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,240
because compliance you know it's a big

481
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,410
business it's a lot of enterprise

482
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,730
companies they have lots of clothes or

483
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,010
software and I'm not saying that those

484
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,079
tools aren't good I actually have some

485
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,859
I've actually had some pretty

486
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,030
interesting conversations with the

487
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,209
nessus team about some of this stuff but

488
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,500
you know we're at FOSDEM so let's talk

489
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,160
about open source stuff

490
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,990
so the most popular one and this is

491
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,369
something there's actually I think I

492
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,609
looked through the foster schedule and

493
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,740
there's been I think there's two or

494
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,359
three talks about open s camp it's

495
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,820
putting the words popular one out there

496
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,049
there's lots of tooling around it

497
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,120
Red Hat maintained a lot of stuff for it

498
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,950
there's lots of pre-existing standards

499
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,280
things like FISMA and DSS and yeah it

500
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,890
plugs into a lot of things so the most

501
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,299
basic implementation of that is the

502
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,830
actual command line tool so this is me

503
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,110
running it on a vagrant box I'm just

504
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,700
using it and just doing a yum install to

505
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,440
install it I'm running in a vowel with

506
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,169
the most basic report and then it gives

507
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,880
me a file on disk like an actual HTML

508
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,110
file I can look through and see all

509
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,640
those compliance damage there's also the

510
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,169
scat workbench which is just a GUI for

511
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,059
this and this works of SSH as well so

512
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,919
you can do it on remote systems just

513
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,030
means a slightly easier than having to

514
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,710
do on the command line and save one of

515
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,000
the good things about open escape isn't

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
because it's a standard people have

517
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,510
written a lot of tools to use it so you

518
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,650
don't have to do on the command line you

519
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,559
don't have to do it exactly with the

520
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,280
benchmark they're out of the way there's

521
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,250
api's and stuff like that so Foreman

522
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,630
actually has a plugin for this and

523
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,010
satellite is built on top of Foreman so

524
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,390
satellite also has an open air that s

525
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,190
cup scanner and funnily enough I just

526
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,510
added this light in five minutes ago

527
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,860
because I checked and there's actually a

528
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,490
talk about doing Foreman with open s cap

529
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,870
so if you want to go learn more about

530
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,190
that there's actually a talk tomorrow in

531
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,270
the security track so go see that as

532
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,010
well an open s cap the only one I saw is

533
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,740
Linus I think it's fairly new I think

534
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,970
it's about two or three years old this

535
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,039
point and it's pretty cool it's open

536
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,090
source it works on a lot of platforms

537
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,860
it's fairly simple to install I think

538
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,320
it's just a binary that you can get the

539
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,500
sad thing is that the actual compliance

540
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,059
standard plugins like so where your

541
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:00,250
works is it has like a sort base system

542
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,870
and then your plugin for the various

543
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,640
compliance standards you've got so the

544
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,159
compliance standards are actually

545
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,150
they're commercial and it not open

546
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,950
source so you can run it on a basic

547
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,150
overall scan that looks something like

548
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,880
this I can't see it but the idea is that

549
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
you run it on your system and it just

550
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,669
goes for and looks at this or standard

551
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,530
stuff makes your etc' password has the

552
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,909
right permissions make sure that your

553
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,809
grub has password and that kind of stuff

554
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:24,549
and the last one which people don't talk

555
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,169
about so much is using Packer

556
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,510
for compliance so they're looking really

557
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,970
good talk by Verna buck at the

558
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,890
last hash econ and he was talking about

559
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,590
how they use packer with AWS and am is

560
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,809
to do compliance because some of the

561
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,100
compliance standards especially on

562
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,110
things like file mounts and you know

563
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,490
grub settings and things like that

564
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,080
they're hard to do on running systems

565
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,460
it's the kind of thing you probably want

566
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,280
to bake into your golden image process

567
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,350
sort earlier on in the stack because it

568
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,480
makes you a lot easier to do and yeah

569
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,340
like you know how she can't actually

570
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,140
cope do or some products and packet and

571
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,760
a lot of cool stuff and the thing about

572
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,990
factories that have provisioning

573
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,760
provisioners like pretty much all the

574
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,919
popular conflict management tools out

575
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,049
there so you know has a shell provision

576
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:06,010
our puppet for business chef for

577
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,299
business so you can use that code yet

578
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:08,620
you've already written use it and bake

579
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,010
it into your a.m. eyes and your various

580
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,690
kind of gotten image things so how do we

581
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,919
actually report this stuff other than

582
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
using open SKF and linus and that kind

583
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,520
of stuff there's a Wynonna system

584
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,260
testing dear self so the most popular

585
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,480
one who everyone's heard of so who here

586
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,520
has heard of service spec or he's even

587
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,559
using service pack right cool that's

588
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,450
like twenty thirty people all right so

589
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,059
it's fairly popular and if you're not

590
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,169
familiar that looks something like this

591
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,299
it's basically if you're familiar aspect

592
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,120
looks something like this basically sort

593
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,650
of our spec helpers to do things like

594
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,049
check like files our own system and they

595
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,520
have the right permissions so here's a

596
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,380
really basic CIS check it's for the one

597
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,600
we talked about earlier on the GPG and

598
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,919
it makes it go through make sure that's

599
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,510
all there so you run this on your system

600
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,950
and it gives you I think saying note

601
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,150
that files not there or had the wrong

602
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,780
permissions so if server spec is so

603
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,909
popular that's inspired a bunch of other

604
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,870
kind of port of it so you've got got

605
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,429
which is pretty much the same thing but

606
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,299
we and then go

607
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,539
you've got infra tester which is

608
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,409
basically the same thing but with

609
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,440
reserved keywords for things like HTTP

610
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,450
requests and headers and my ceilin stuff

611
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,679
like that

612
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,620
you've got gaunlet which is more of a

613
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,570
BDD version of this and similar we have

614
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,000
BDD security so those are same they're

615
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,559
written and gherkin their feature files

616
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,390
that you run but it's basically wrappers

617
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,039
around actual security tools so things

618
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,620
like making sure that your that's more

619
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,090
of a kind of app set kind of side of it

620
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,350
but you can do some of that for your

621
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,890
compliance stuff as well and even though

622
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,090
it's compared to the operation mention

623
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,950
this to this quite cool tool in specs by

624
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,059
chef it's pretty much kind of like a

625
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,249
clean room color for cover them service

626
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,230
pack it works in a similar way it looks

627
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,669
something like this again that quotation

628
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,679
token better color for this but the idea

629
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,259
is that it just extended key words on

630
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,179
top of service pack kind of language to

631
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,919
say you know this is the compliance for

632
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,360
all and it's lift level of security that

633
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,159
has these tags then the code itself

634
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,769
looks quite similar past config file

635
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,200
each ECE uncom should contain GPT check

636
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,370
is one and then there's a talker

637
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,110
complete a config madison county 16

638
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,269
about using this and actually the

639
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,830
beginning part of it is quite similar to

640
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,990
talking about how compliance shouldn't

641
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,279
be a bunch of papers and it should be

642
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,539
actual code that you can give out and

643
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:27,799
stuff like that so what are we learnt

644
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,269
compliance enforcement of standards it's

645
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,710
not security but it's part of a security

646
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,200
flow and in the best case it should be

647
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,419
moved left you shouldn't be throwing the

648
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,289
stuff over the fence the last minute

649
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,100
yeah as me said compliance

650
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,690
responsibilities can be tricky like who

651
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,220
ultimately is actually responsible for

652
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,230
this stuff is the octene is the security

653
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,789
team do you have a dedicated compliance

654
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,769
team

655
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,659
Kovach management fits really well with

656
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,570
the compliance kind of use case the idea

657
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,799
that you have to enforce standards based

658
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,220
on that pretty close and regardless of

659
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,450
the tool you use there's a lot of

660
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,039
pre-existing work so don't just start

661
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,360
all over again and enforcement just part

662
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,159
of the puzzle reporting is out there as

663
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,429
well and unfortunately there's not much

664
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:12,899
open-source software for this stuff but

665
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,340
there is lots of existing tools that you

666
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,619
can use but ultimately depending on the

667
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:17,820
compliance standard you're following you

668
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,409
might actually have to use a commercial

669
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,519
product because they're the owns have

670
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,749
been signed up for it they keep things

671
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,740
like PCI so if you want to know more

672
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,779
there's a bunch of awesome talk they're

673
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,330
out there this one from last year's papa

674
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,190
comp it's actually Trevor talking about

675
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,869
Sims and how it all works and have an

676
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:35,549
open-source compliance they talk about

677
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,499
more of the complex news cases they

678
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,429
actually have some pretty cool stuff

679
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,889
where when they were testing all of

680
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:43,019
their state compliance stuff they were

681
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,580
using beaker which is like a Test

682
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,740
Kitchen like for automation tool and

683
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,269
they actually caught a bunch of kernel

684
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:51,210
bugs in various Linux distributions so

685
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,889
using this automated software and using

686
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,059
this they actually caught problems both

687
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,500
in the compliance standards and in the

688
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,299
actual upstream which is pretty cool

689
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,279
and if you've not read the DevOps

690
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,690
handbook there's a really good section

691
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,429
by Jean Kim and others there's a really

692
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:04,169
good section on compliance and so that's

693
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,450
a love it's hard to find a lot of real

694
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,919
life use cases of compliance stuff

695
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,870
because people don't like talking about

696
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,460
their compliance because legal stuff

697
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,960
people get scared about it but they

698
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,460
don't have a bunch of case studies and

699
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,299
there that's really good so I've gone

700
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,270
way faster than I thought I would so

701
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,890
when I tie myself doing this at home I

702
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,990
did about this about 55 minutes I've

703
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,880
done this in about 25 so got lots of

704
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,870
time for questions that people have

705
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,850
questions no okay then I get to go

706
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:47,010
they're going up here I think the summit

707
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,870
is I know for PCI it isn't I went

708
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,240
through the ASV for PCI on 40 open s cap

709
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,330
isn't but the general use case I've seen

710
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,620
for it and talking to companies that use

711
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,779
it is that it's a good way of catching

712
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:58,980
that stuff before you have to hand it

713
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,419
over to the official scanner kind of

714
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,010
team so it means that you can bring

715
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,450
stuff on earlier on instead of having

716
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,890
all that stuff out there and then having

717
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,360
it back and going oh no everything's

718
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,799
gone wrong the nest skank all the stuff

719
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:17,010
you can bring it earlier on okay yeah so

720
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,169
the question was is open s cap signed

721
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,570
off for compliance standards and the

722
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,450
answer is it depends but I know for PCI

723
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,090
DSS it isn't but yeah it depends on the

724
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,220
standards and a lot of time people kind

725
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,390
of use it internally for their ops team

726
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,980
and that the compliance team handle the

727
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,630
actual kind of official audit compliance

728
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,190
mess any other questions no okay well

729
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,870
sorry about going too fast and come up

730
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,710
and talk to me if you have any more

731
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,150
questions thank you very much

732
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,459
[Applause]
