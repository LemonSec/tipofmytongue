00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:27,020
 in what is sap hana and explains how you can use it or leave it features

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,530
 as well as if the dispo have to say that i will demonstration of which

4
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:48,910
 includes features the product of the future product of work with sap hana for

5
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:56,089
 quite a few so es apps company is marketing for business software

6
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,829
 if this business software manufacturer

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:15,859
 sap hcm system is in memory data westminster is reads in maine memory

8
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:33,908
 a compressor in the cloud platform

9
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:44,929
 picture text services or processing special information as well as a

10
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:52,219
 rolltor machine learning al gore is okay so you can use as usual sap hana

11
00:01:52,219 --> 00:02:00,109
 madness liveserver landscapes bad vigaun sun express edition you can

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:16,430
 ram so basically can be used for your project is back end

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:24,170
 as before known grafs last quarter introduction because graphically not graf

 triple subject predicate and object this becomes this steffani attribute it

20
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:12,480

25
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,900
 that means that sums to have to capitol count out of the database and application

26
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:18,798
 lifecycle s interface which doesn't of structured to implement

27
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:29,270
 in the application is to use of space extraction

28
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:54,650
 the application cache sizes to the graf database information and features

29
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:42,240
 the interfaces like sing to the highly active traction updating facebook page

 interface vivantes open before the analysis met christopher graf script wishes is

42
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:50,940
 language that i find and in some little bit more about it and the database

43
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:33,329
 weekend is completely integrated into a nassovia computer transaction processing

44
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:43,510
 that is the ju state of the data base and houston infrastructure what you

 the count is consistently the for fierce china

50
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:48,730

 news.at adds the new live data because i have problems with updating

54
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:35,690
 data network is not to be in the table a user type so can be the most expensive and

55
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,680
 can be type of posts and sometimes it's better to have persons in the table and

 at most label sandwiches we have created to the person created poster post

60
00:11:32,989 --> 00:12:06,019
 pictures basic so little bit interface as well as started to implement of technology

00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:15,629
 publisher paradox interactive data base developers kenzo implement starts

62
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:23,879
 best matches and workers and we can express from complex filters talks like

65
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:44,419
 that means we are looking for persons and created the bostons is the post

 in the sixth episode Franziska Schwarz stock market knowledge the ages in the path

67
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,600
 to be loss so that's the enemy here in the statement

68
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:43,720
 okay let's get me you can't rita express edition from was data so in the social

69
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,720

70
00:13:49,720 --> 00:14:02,230
 stable creator graf workspace and top fit to execute soap like need you need

71
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:14,170
 to create calculation scenario witches and developed specifics extension and

72
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,699
 top of that we need it because we need to specify & witsch workshop leader

73
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:28,479
 statement as well as the creators calculation scenario calculation scenario of the stand

74
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,290
 here the west on the calculation scenario can be used as templates

75
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:43,420
 copied and when we said calculation scenario results to by franziska

76
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:51,479
 black so that the first impression line created the same post of geneva

77
00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:02,230
 how create the costing scenario i can select the ghetto person's posted

78
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,500
 guide lies as well as interactively followed and after releasing

79
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:25,819
 because extras like of a build in algorithms cent who fit the first one

80
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:35,559
 is a posse patches basically presses for search with return strategies and

81
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:44,600
 travel in which the world s sas input parameter you need to provide the word

82
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,879
 excel set of word is you have to specify the direction of the witch direction

85
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:21,730
 put together table service desks traffic light when restarting frankfurt so that basic

86
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:32,329
 geocities think of transportation networks if we instead of frankfurt

87
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:39,138

 sc stuttgart in june in the second level in berlin the level in stuttgart in the

89
00:16:52,789 --> 00:17:01,970
 princely okay the second algorithms it is so that basically you have to

90
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:10,459
 start with six and wait what you want to be used to create the shortest du die

91
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:20,889
 friends shortest path of the channel

92
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:32,350
 wait for it again for four die output gateway to cost to transform des

93
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:43,809

 connected components word excel street worker of the omniscient die

95
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:59,158

96
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,720
 components in the same component

97
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:13,510
 last little bit about graf script scripts domain specific languages ​​isley

98
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:20,320
 design rolf graf organized problems here

99
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,389
 built want to know how else the language to be it should be a high level

100
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:32,110
 lang which you should be able to ride your and complete with windows language

101
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:39,610
 that we want to the building blocks grafs pacific airways low level consumption

102
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:47,100
 the building spot can be's typical standard graf algorithm will do this

103
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:57,480
 grafs entries should be times of des language which makes it possible that

104
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:08,320
 you can read in return path recycler second algorithms zu ist so for example

107
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:30,840
 algorithmics impossible to optimize tobacco standard if we know how

108
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,340
 sometimes we can you so much more efficient torn

109
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:50,500
 the same algorithm channel count the agency to complain about custom logics legs

110
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:57,039
 torn to standard count don't have to have completed the

111
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,700
 complete algorithm of the education blog and use little bit of fear without logic

112
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:14,070
 inbetween should cover so flexibly folio problems for you in the background of

113
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:22,980
 the rigoletto liga demands compilation in the high level language and how

114
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:32,020
 completely in the low level language that used as one and our goal is to a few

115
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,240
 good wife dior graphic directly in the low level language as well as want to

116
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:47,529
 often abstraction like don't want abstraction butt we wanted zuus

117
00:20:47,529 --> 00:21:08,279
 performance franz sticks okay so fix traffic light syntax would be so graf script and

118
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:34,990
 construction set container the same thing the ages an account at elements

119
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:42,640
 end in this assets and candy far the number of ages at the number of word

120
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:55,660
 this was the example of the some cases construct so he built in

121
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:04,860
 functions slightly mad men rachel is torn here in the first line tag

122
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,620
 microsoft workspace at fashionette

123
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:22,470
 will you are the pacific will the input parameter take that works of the charges

124
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:32,440
 second whiskey and input parameter exactly from today youtube image is in algorithms

125
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:46,210
 and count of the word excel word excel to engage result the example is general

126
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:56,020
 purpose programming language construct live in tv container and usf1 blogs like that

127
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:03,370
 here is an example of how over and together thereupon evil four for two worlds of the

128
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,699
 Patients with a knowledge of might be there you want to get what you can do it

129
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,970
 can you can felte graf workspace get to work with can put historical interest

130
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:39,040
 for this work [music]

131
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:54,610
 so here that's mine proceed with the witches create the future the future

132
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:04,479
 Pay and the car crisis are just the same

133
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,990
 here very passively recognize here as a passive further input parameter so cage

134
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:58,750
 throws him acts and staff costs so much and numbers is just this

135
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:10,050
 basically the features as often so new features in the product many of them up

136
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:24,070
 and download here is the link download and you have to lock in internet

137
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:30,220
 can download virtual machine manager and a potential

138
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,620
 virtual machines right up to the gate

139
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:43,200
 [Applause]

140
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:09,630
 the first class is already the neck is for open source but you can use it

141
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:17,659
 with the open source you can build your open source application and topfit das
