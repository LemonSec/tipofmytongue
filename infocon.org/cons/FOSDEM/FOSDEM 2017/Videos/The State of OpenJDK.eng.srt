1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,920
[Applause]

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,900
very good

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,740
good morning and and welcome to FOSDEM

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,390
my name is mark Reinhold I work on Java

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,060
still so I was putting these these these

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,840
quick slides together for for this this

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,329
presentation this morning the state of

8
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,520
open JDK which I've been doing now for a

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,329
while and I ran across a logo that

10
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,770
you've probably all seen as you know a

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,870
couple of years ago we celebrated Java

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,930
being 20 years old it's now old enough

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,320
to drink in many jurisdictions and it

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,829
occurred to me you know this is 2017 and

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,940
this is the 11th time I've been at

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,340
FOSDEM the 11th time many people from

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,750
Sun and then Oracle have been at FOSDEM

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,030
so if if I'm not if I don't have a

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,890
fencepost error this means that open JDK

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,000
is ten years old since all of us all the

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,409
source code was released in May of 2007

22
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,810
so you know just looking back a bit you

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,460
know at least speaking speaking

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,680
personally of thank you everybody for

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,750
your support you know I I fondly

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,460
remember the warm welcome that with that

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,520
us folks from Sun had 11 years ago when

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,220
we first came to foz demand it was us in

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,439
the free Java crowd and I think it's

30
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,350
actually fairly amazing what what we've

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,759
all built together so thank you very

32
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,570
much

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,050
[Applause]

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,020
okay so as usual we've had some growth I

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,420
we have some improvements I'd like to

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,210
talk about a bit and then speak a little

37
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,340
about a bit about the presence and and

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,479
the future in openjdk we have a

39
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,970
structure of groups and projects there

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,800
were there were no no new groups this

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,550
year or this past year we have had a

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,390
number of of new projects s/390 export

43
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,700
those of you who really want to run java

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,420
on mainframes

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,330
you can do it JDK 10 you know nine nine

46
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,250
eight nine is nine is starting to wind

47
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,870
down we need to need a place to start

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,150
doing work for 10 so JDK 10 is spun up

49
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,640
we've got forests going and some you

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,750
know some of the initial sort of

51
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,880
paperwork busy work change sets to

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,340
change version numbers and and source

53
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,690
and release levels and and all that

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,820
stuff is floating in there and then

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,590
there's a call for votes active right

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,200
now on project amber which all I'll talk

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
about a little bit more later on anyway

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
so so we've got some new projects we've

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,980
got a bunch of new committers in in this

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,860
past year the ones in orange do not work

61
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,209
for Oracle so that's that's for 846 new

62
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,459
committers seven not from Oracle the non

63
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,769
Oracle ones are range range from Intel

64
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,880
Red Hat sa P and one Lennar o1 one

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,310
person from Lennar oh so that's that's

66
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,370
good we have some new reviewers

67
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,510
reviewers have have a little more

68
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,459
stature than committers they have the

69
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,320
authority to review change sets going

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,570
into the release projects so these are

71
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,590
these are people with a lot of

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,450
experience who have hoover and earned a

73
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,329
lot of trust but the ones in orange

74
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,310
don't don't work for oracle the ones

75
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,769
whose last names are in orange used to

76
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:51,000
work for oracle recently mr shipp 11

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,320
well so yes so they're still a little

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,690
tainted we started their first names are

79
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,670
tainted and their last names are better

80
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,989
yeah Lexie you know you know tragic

81
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:03,340
career move decided to leave the company

82
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,620
and go to Red Hat there well

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,829
Michael helped is is off doing doing

84
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:11,890
other stuff so anyway so we so we have

85
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,400
new reviewers that's all great

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,190
improvements the vulnerability group

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,680
lawyers so I spoke about this was it

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,780
three years ago now here or was it only

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,139
two to two years ago actually did did a

90
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,600
30-minute presentation here with with

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,370
the basics of the proposal the idea to

92
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,789
have a group in openjdk that unlike any

93
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,500
other group has special dispensation

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,850
from the governing board to talk about

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,380
things in secret because when you're

96
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,870
talking about security issues you need

97
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,340
the ability to do that and I think

98
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,360
everybody understands that to make all

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,479
of that work there needs to be a legal

100
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,080
document that the lawyers of not not

101
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,150
just Oracle like we can spread the blame

102
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,520
around all the big companies any lawyers

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,139
from all these companies need need to

104
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,479
reread it and and vet it and agree that

105
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:15,190
it's reasonable I'm told by George Saab

106
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,250
that we have a near final document that

107
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,830
there's just one detail left to iron out

108
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,560
that may or may not require additional

109
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,740
changes to the document with any luck

110
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,409
we'll be able to get this done what next

111
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,370
few months George says thumbs up next

112
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,780
few months so definitely definitely

113
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,810
maybe oh well okay room for improvement

114
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,630
so there have been a couple of fairly

115
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,699
big sore points in terms of process and

116
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,830
infrastructure and you know because

117
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,500
there are still things that that we're

118
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,810
done inside Sun and then continued to be

119
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,440
done inside Oracle and and this is you

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,320
know it's not it's not right for what is

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,240
supposed to be an open development

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,949
community so we've been working to fix

123
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,159
those

124
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:12,189
one of those issues is is the mysterious

125
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,429
CCC this mysterious review body inside

126
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,799
Oracle that that sometimes gives people

127
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,329
a hard time because they're making

128
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,339
changes that are blatantly incompatible

129
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,789
or or have other issues the other is the

130
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,969
whole hotspot building test problem

131
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,919
where you know by now we have a number

132
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,869
of experienced outside committers into

133
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,629
the hotspot code base but we still

134
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,449
maintain the convention the the

135
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,269
discipline which is valuable to keep to

136
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,919
keep high quality the hot you know any

137
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,869
changed hotspot code has to go through

138
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,599
an oracle internal build and test system

139
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,209
and well obviously this is this is not a

140
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,599
good thing long-term so i'm happy to be

141
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,009
able to report some progress on these

142
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,319
there's a a proposal for a new group

143
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,379
before the governing board right now for

144
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,629
a new group called the compatibility and

145
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,269
special specification review group so

146
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:11,949
this is to replace the mysterious ccc so

147
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,309
a draft of its charter is here you know

148
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,169
that just to be clear this is not this

149
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,699
is not a group of people that's that's

150
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,459
expected to create things or innovate

151
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,929
things it's you can think of it much

152
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,610
more as it's like it's like the

153
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,519
editorial board of an or the editorial

154
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,469
staff of a newspaper their job is to

155
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,949
look out for consistency to look out for

156
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,599
you make make sure things are motivated

157
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,099
to make sure that when when an

158
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,749
incompatible change is being made that

159
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,429
it's justified and that it's risk is

160
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:42,639
understood and sometimes we do choose to

161
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,789
make incompatible changes so we need to

162
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:47,110
make sure everybody knows about those

163
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,509
you know and finally get consistency

164
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,519
consistency with with the interfaces or

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,499
when it when an interface is being

166
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,639
changed it's important to be as

167
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,049
consistent as reasonable with

168
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,089
surrounding interfaces with the overall

169
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:02,469
conventions of the platform so the

170
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,619
initial membership of the group is is

171
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,299
here Doug Lee still doesn't work for

172
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,689
Oracle and and he you know he has been

173
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,749
one of one of the principal people

174
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,639
reminding us of the problem of the CCC

175
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,610
so as punishment for that he gets to be

176
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,710
on it

177
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,690
so we we have prototype support for this

178
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,310
process in the open JDK bug system it's

179
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,980
it's it's reasonably lightweight for for

180
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,470
a simple change you know you you could

181
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,120
create a see it you would you'll create

182
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
a CSR issue you fill out some

183
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,659
information what's the problem you're

184
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,110
solving

185
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,880
what's the rough shape of the solution

186
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,590
what it what are the details of the

187
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,720
specification that you're changing and

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,610
we expect the you know the process

189
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,890
itself will be ironed out by the initial

190
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,840
the initial group numbers one once the

191
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,070
group is up and running which should be

192
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,590
 you should be soon but I expect it

193
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,450
will be a very fairly lightweight late

194
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,490
lazy consensus type of thing where a

195
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,020
proposal will go in it'll be it'll be on

196
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,150
a week timer say and if nobody objects

197
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,590
within a week then then it's just

198
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,540
approved unless somebody decides oh this

199
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,800
is big and I need more time to think

200
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,390
about it then they can put it in a

201
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,040
pending state and go off and think about

202
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,900
it and and come back but then of course

203
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,070
they're obligated to let the let the

204
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,890
submitter know what the story is so

205
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,850
that's that's the proposal there I'm

206
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,050
pretty hopeful that we can get this done

207
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,240
in the next few months all right

208
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,160
the second improvement to address the

209
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,880
hotspot building test problem is an

210
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,330
experimental mechanism that we're

211
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,790
calling submission for forests so I

212
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,230
emphasize that the size that this is

213
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,380
experimental at least two people in this

214
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,570
this room room Volker Volker and Andrew

215
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,160
have have tried this out so they've

216
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,220
they've seen the details so this is a

217
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,820
well it's kind of a cheap hack and thing

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,480
about this problem more than a year ago

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,820
to it occurred you know this whole

220
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,630
problem well you've got a natural

221
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,760
building test system externalizing the

222
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,470
whole thing is a huge effort that well

223
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,020
yeah eventually we want to do but we is

224
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,580
there some is there some cheaper thing

225
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,900
we can do first with the infrastructure

226
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,210
that we have without building any you

227
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,980
know some new conduit for code to come

228
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,330
in because we if we have some new

229
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,910
conduit than you know Oracle internals

230
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,440
network security people will get all

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,610
worried and you have to go through six

232
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,870
months of approvals in just a nightmare

233
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,850
well we already have a conduit for

234
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,110
getting code in right it's called

235
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,030
mercurial we can make as many mercurial

236
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,170
for us as we want

237
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,660
that's easy that's an approved input

238
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,999
channel so this notion of submit

239
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,670
submission for us is it's a it's a

240
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,299
forest on HG openjdk java.net

241
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,179
you can create a branch there put your

242
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,449
patch in push that in and the internal

243
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,790
build system will pick up that patch do

244
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,429
a build run all the tests and let you

245
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:59,179
know what the status is and if obviously

246
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,339
if it doesn't work you you've got more

247
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,529
work to do and if it involves some some

248
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,749
oracle internal problem than an oracle

249
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,609
person is you know oracle is obligated

250
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:09,230
to find a person to help you but if it

251
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,660
works which is the common case then it

252
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,059
will automatically be merged in to the

253
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,059
hot spot master so it's it's it's pretty

254
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,429
simple here's here's an example of how

255
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,589
it would work you'd clone clone the

256
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,189
submission forest set it set it set that

257
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:27,799
set the depth def path for it make a new

258
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,209
branch in this case we're just making

259
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:30,919
some fake branch with a silly issue

260
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,129
number here we're gonna put the date on

261
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,069
the readme Wow commit that go get your

262
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:39,739
code review and push that you push that

263
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:42,290
you know within some reasonable amount

264
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,549
of amount of time it usually usually

265
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,350
takes around an hour to do all the all

266
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,660
the internal build and test stuff you'll

267
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,399
get an email from an internal thought

268
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,999
saying yes it worked and right after

269
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,160
that you'll get an email notifying you

270
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,139
that the change set went went in under

271
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,059
your name or you'll get any me an email

272
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,429
saying no it didn't work here some

273
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,809
people you could maybe contact to help

274
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,419
you resolve the issue so it's not an

275
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,299
ideal solution but it's some progress

276
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,220
there there are more details on it at

277
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,899
this this wiki page on wiki dot OpenJDK

278
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,639
if you want to have a look at what's

279
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,199
going on so this is still kind of

280
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,059
experimental we're working out some

281
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,489
kinks Andrew and Volker have been very

282
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,379
very helpful in in some initial trials

283
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,329
but we'll open this up more generally to

284
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,399
people who commit regularly into hotspot

285
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,509
fairly soon

286
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,019
do you still need web reps well you

287
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,060
still need code review how do you do it

288
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,870
I think the the me the medium ever of

289
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,670
your code review is between you and your

290
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,550
reviewer so you know if you have you

291
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,560
just want to email a patch around and

292
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,959
they're happy with that and then that's

293
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,269
fine okay so that's another another

294
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:02,670
improvement so growth improvement

295
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,319
present so there's this big thing called

296
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,500
nain it's yeah we're trying we're trying

297
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,389
to get it done there's there's there's a

298
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,189
fair amount of stuff in it there's

299
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:13,600
believe it or not a fair amount of stuff

300
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,699
in it that's not jigsaw despite what you

301
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,279
may have heard so you're all the the

302
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
projects of various size is feeding into

303
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,480
it I'm not not going to go through these

304
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,720
in in detail there are a whole bunch of

305
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,370
Japs eighty nine of them I'm certainly

306
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,829
not going to go through these in detail

307
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,660
but if you have any questions if you can

308
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,050
see them yeah they're there they're all

309
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,019
here I think the the jet process is

310
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,800
worked out reasonably well in terms of

311
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,779
letting us track things at a finer finer

312
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,850
granularity than project but a bigger

313
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,029
granularity than that issues in in in

314
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,430
the bug system in terms of schedule we

315
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,199
are right about there so we're in ramp

316
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,000
down now we're trying to get a handle on

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,399
the overall bug count trying to figure

318
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,870
out what you know are there important

319
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,459
bugs that well we really don't think we

320
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,819
can fix in time and you know and this we

321
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,199
as everybody not just people work for

322
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,660
Oracle you know and it need to be

323
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,769
different mean didn't need to be

324
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,040
deferred to the next release are they're

325
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,269
low priority bugs that we can just

326
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,480
shuffle off all that sort of thing when

327
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,220
we get to ramp down phase two the

328
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,040
controls will will you know the knobs

329
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
type will tighten a little more and and

330
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
we'll be entering a mode where if we're

331
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,579
eventually only critical bugs can be

332
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,220
fixed so we're still aiming to have a

333
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,620
final release candidate in early July

334
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,259
and a Gigi

335
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,779
release in late July and to the best of

336
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,499
my knowledge those dates are still

337
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:54,389
realistic but it's software

338
00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:00,059
anything could happen beyond nine number

339
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,899
of active projects well or not so

340
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,489
accurate projects that used that still

341
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,079
might be nice to see in some release

342
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,939
after nine not saying it would not not

343
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,289
saying any of these are bound for ten or

344
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,850
eleven twelve or anything in particular

345
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,319
amber is the is this new project that

346
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,660
Brian gets just recently proposed the

347
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,139
the goal of am Amber's to explore some

348
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,850
smaller productivity oriented Java

349
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,359
language features so it's it's you could

350
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,009
think of it as some way in complexity

351
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:31,199
scope as somewhere it's somewhere it's

352
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,850
somewhat more than coin was coin was

353
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,549
really just kind of Saints handing off

354
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:36,929
some small rough edges

355
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,769
you know lambda was big nose big stuff

356
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,089
Panama and Valhalla are are also

357
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,609
reasonably big am amber is is somewhere

358
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,879
between that some of the ideas that

359
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,379
Brian wants to explore there include

360
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,949
local variable type inference and

361
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,230
enhanced enumerations and and some of

362
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,759
the some of the leftovers from the land

363
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,499
to design some some things that could be

364
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,119
improved in in lambda expressions memory

365
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,759
model update this is a project Doug Lee

366
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,949
and some others started it would sure be

367
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,779
nice to see some progress on this I'm

368
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,129
not sure they're well there are var

369
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:15,839
handle do so far handles are part of

370
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,579
that but but bar handles are a feature

371
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,459
in the JDK the memory model is this

372
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,259
complex document with lots of symbols in

373
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,139
it and a lot of math and we really need

374
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,039
wait we tweet we need the people who

375
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,369
love doing that stuff to update it I I

376
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,259
enjoy reading it from time to time I

377
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,129
don't I I don't I don't have the I don't

378
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,929
have a bandwidth to work to work on that

379
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,449
kind of thing myself anymore sadly

380
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:43,889
anyway memory model yeah it'd be nice

381
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,639
Panama is about interconnecting Java and

382
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,799
native code in a better way than Jay and

383
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,989
I because we all know she and I kind of

384
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,829
mmm-hmm sucked intentionally so by the

385
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,929
way for those of you don't know

386
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,180
Shenandoah new GC

387
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,940
making progress getting there maybe

388
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,510
that'll show up and Valhalla is is for

389
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,460
value types and generic specialization

390
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,579
which is a huge change not just to the

391
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,990
language but also some fairly deep

392
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,000
changes to the Java Virtual Machine okay

393
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,220
I work for Oracle which means you

394
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,329
shouldn't leave the word I've said

395
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,740
and we have a few minutes left for

396
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,240
questions before the timer goes off and

397
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,560
the recording stops yeah Mario we have a

398
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,580
mic for this purpose right

399
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:56,690
we have a mic with a switch nevermind it

400
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,670
works ok yes those tests from this for

401
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,730
those statement forests are they derived

402
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,060
from Oracle or just written my community

403
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,450
also and how frequent there from

404
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,210
enhancing so that the the tests that are

405
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,070
run on the internal building test system

406
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,960
some some of them are the tests that you

407
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,430
find an approach a decay the usual

408
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,030
regression in unit tests others are are

409
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,530
more akin to performance and robustness

410
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,370
tests that are internal to Oracle in in

411
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,930
the long term we'd like to publish them

412
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,740
openly but right now we don't thank you

413
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,360
get your exercise that way waters first

414
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,190
of all I I have to congratulate you that

415
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,980
page with all the Jets that going to 9

416
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,840
is so cool there's so much stuff in

417
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,730
there yeah congratulations for getting

418
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,560
it all in well congratulations to the

419
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,200
people behind those jobs I III merely

420
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,930
collate them but yeah it's it's a lot of

421
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,250
work 9 as 9 is a pretty big release my

422
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,960
second thing is I have a lot of passion

423
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,850
for languages on top of the JVM and I'm

424
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,020
wondering if you could say a word or two

425
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:20,270
about about the state of that no the

426
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,610
language is on top of the JVM are a

427
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,400
wonderful thing you know I'm gonna list

428
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,410
guy i'll i love cloture i play with it i

429
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,300
really write little things in it it's

430
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,850
it's very cool if there's more stuff

431
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,220
that that we can do to make make them

432
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,320
run better we should we should think

433
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,370
about doing it i don't really have much

434
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,750
more to say i mean i I don't I don't

435
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,730
track all those different language

436
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,280
communities closely but you know JRuby

437
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,990
is clearly really healthy Charlie might

438
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,880
be here somewhere if not he'll be here

439
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,169
later Charlie and Tom are here somewhere

440
00:19:52,169 --> 00:20:00,090
have their own room I could be JRuby

441
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,619
different but yeah I mean we've hit

442
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:03,210
there's JRuby there's Scala there's

443
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,999
closure you know and a whole collection

444
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,389
of somewhat smaller projects that I mean

445
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:10,799
there's just this guy doing small talk

446
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,309
thing now no it's great it's cool I'm

447
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,200
awesome it's not just about Java

448
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,359
it's so as you mentioned that you plan

449
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,460
to introduce some improvements on the

450
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,590
build process of the open JDK and

451
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,899
particularly do you plan to make the

452
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,690
built easier for Windows because it's

453
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,379
quite difficult to build open JDK under

454
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,029
Windows it's a lot easier than it used

455
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:47,529
to be so I I don't know of were you

456
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,919
gonna reply to that ok I I don't know if

457
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,700
any of anybody who's planning to do more

458
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,019
work on that if you wanted to show up

459
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:59,739
and and help do some you know a proposal

460
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:02,289
would would be welcome I obviously

461
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,119
Windows is kind of not really the

462
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,029
primary development platform and is not

463
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,919
the most pleasant platform to develop on

464
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,729
anyway but there it is so no I mean five

465
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,190
minutes left

466
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,409
where's the worth of my no no because

467
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,629
the recording won't get it and if I

468
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,639
repeat it I will I will not get it right

469
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,229
a bit of a specific question about

470
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:29,229
jigsaw and he's always Jaya committee

471
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,389
happy now with what we have in jigsaw

472
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:35,789
that's off topic that's the next talk

473
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,119
but if there no are the questions I'll

474
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,979
give you a quick answer which which is I

475
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:46,659
which is I don't know I mean I there

476
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:49,059
there there has always been a prominent

477
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,979
OSGi person on the jsr 376 expert group

478
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,779
we wait for a long time as Peter greens

479
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:59,830
and now it's been Neil Bartlett they

480
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,429
appear content you know I think at this

481
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,109
point people understand that jigsaw

482
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,389
isn't OSGi that we're not using those

483
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:09,009
jehad to modularize the platform because

484
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:11,049
we can't there are the things we need to

485
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:13,029
be able to do that OS gee I can't do

486
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,340
OS GI is still a useful technology if

487
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,649
you need the dynamic life cycle stuff

488
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,499
and all of that keep using it it'll keep

489
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:24,789
working Martha how long question we have

490
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,799
reduced the footprint for example by

491
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,109
using jigsaw the footprint of the gear M

492
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,659
is small smaller now

493
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,450
the question is

494
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,050
and one tract what's the foot body of a

495
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,310
fully working system grounding yoga like

496
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,460
if you take our kernel user space

497
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,680
programs what's the minimal footprint

498
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,280
required to run open UDK that's a good

499
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,710
question I don't know the answer offhand

500
00:22:52,710 --> 00:23:02,670
but we should measure it search these

501
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,260
was asking a question that I don't know

502
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,070
if you're going to address this in the

503
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,590
next talk but it's a performance analyst

504
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,110
I'm wondering if you have any numbers or

505
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,980
charts for us

506
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,580
no can you talk to you know kind of the

507
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,640
state of open judicata performance a

508
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,710
little bit eight and nine are you still

509
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,330
making pretty dashboards like I did for

510
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,240
you before oh yeah they're there they're

511
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,170
still dashboards a performance

512
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,310
performance is hard I mean ship 11 knows

513
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,330
this right performance is is is really

514
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,100
hard it's not worse I would say it's

515
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,190
it's not it's not worse we've had some

516
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,020
we've had had some energy to entertain

517
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,940
and entertaining adventures with jigsaw

518
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,640
because now at startup time well you've

519
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,230
got this module system that's going and

520
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,210
looking for modules and reading stuff in

521
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,830
and doing resolution and building a

522
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,210
graph and setting all the stuff up in

523
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,130
the VM oh my goodness startup is gonna

524
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,160
really be horrible and for a while it

525
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,220
was but we but we put we pulled some

526
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,220
tricks and invented some new techniques

527
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,200
that got almost all of it back so

528
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,270
startup of you know the trivial you know

529
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,450
hello world thing is is pretty close to

530
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,900
what it was mayonnaise you know and in

531
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,780
terms of main line you know performance

532
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,160
when everything's warmed up and all that

533
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,440
well you know we've continued to to it

534
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,630
to invest in in situ and other aspects

535
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,240
of the runtime system and since there

536
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,820
are many gems that if you want to know

537
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,500
about performance is probably prudent to

538
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,360
just go to these jets and see their

539
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,610
progress because they usually have the

540
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,440
performance comparisons on their target

541
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,230
or clothes like compact streams for

542
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,570
instance

543
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,690
improve some various string intensive

544
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,700
work laws so you can see what's there

545
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,649
but really the easiest way to do is just

546
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,380
download the gdk9 early access built and

547
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,630
tries yourself on your application

548
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,600
because or build your own if you prefer

549
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,950
on Windows on Windows if you're if you

550
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,590
must that's entirely up to you

551
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,519
alright so time is just about up quickly

552
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,009
you didn't mention perhaps one of the

553
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,440
most dramatic things that's gone in

554
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,450
really quite late in the process which

555
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,889
is IOT compilation Wells's is is it is a

556
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,169
pretty big deal I think IOT is a pretty

557
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,149
big deal it's still experimental but it

558
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,419
works and when it works it kicks ass

559
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,360
alright thank you very much

560
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,520
[Applause]
