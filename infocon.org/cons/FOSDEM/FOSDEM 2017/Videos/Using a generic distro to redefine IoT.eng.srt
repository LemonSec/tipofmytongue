1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,389
40:17 distribution several thank you

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,910
very much and I would like to introduce

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,980
Peter Robinson talking to us about using

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,360
fedora or IOT hello everyone I'm sorry

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,030
for stopping you from your beer so I'm

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,890
going to talk about architecting

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,400
a secure IOT platform using a generic

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,690
distribution such as Fedora so the

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,800
Internet of Things has the potential to

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,930
change the world not necessarily in a

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,560
good way and Linux distributions have

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,220
been around for some time and have a lot

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,220
of the dealing with security and CVS and

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,329
updates and distribution mechanisms and

15
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,450
all that sort of fun stuff for long

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,379
solved and relatively straightforward

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:11,450
and so why can't we use the current

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,840
knowledge to continue to evolve and

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,840
improve the IOT to make it a little bit

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,600
friendlier place for for the world as a

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,049
whole this is a general overview of an

22
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,509
IOT stack one of these days I'll

23
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:31,899
actually get around to doing this

24
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,340
graphic myself because as someone

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,560
pointed out it has a cortex M series

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,099
which you can't exactly run Fedora on so

27
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,560
what would you use as a base platform

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,840
for IOT if you were to use it for fedora

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,869
well the first technology there is a

30
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,479
tech called atomic or OS 3 it enables a

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,840
single snapshot upgrade snapshot

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,009
rollback of a distribution in an atomic

33
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,330
state so if you boot a device with an

34
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,500
update and it doesn't boot or it doesn't

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,360
have network connectivity you can run a

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,870
series of

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,140
health checks and reset back to the old

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,569
version so you should never get into a

39
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,170
situation where you have a brick device

40
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,530
or an uncontacted ball device or a

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,209
device that doesn't have access to all

42
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,810
its senses

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,340
you obviously need a very good focus on

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,760
security and multiple architectures

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,170
obviously x86 is a fairly wide spread

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,390
with a bunch of IOT but obviously arm

47
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,810
and more so these days arm 64 you

48
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,769
certainly a series of well known

49
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,519
architectures that are deep into the IOT

50
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,700
space

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,310
so and that's basically my role is to

52
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,750
build a IOT platform using fedora as a

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,930
base as part of my job at Red Hat to

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,090
help define we're going to initially

55
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,590
focus on a gateway platform both

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,750
industrial and home and various other

57
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,690
use cases and focus on a handful of

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,260
devices although it will work on pretty

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,440
much any device that support is

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,030
supported by fedora but yeah so we like

61
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,879
in the arm space we probably support to

62
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,730
300 different arm devices these days but

63
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,150
it's a lot of work to be able to polish

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,329
each and every one of them so we'll

65
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,060
focus on the Raspberry Pi 2 & 3 because

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,390
obviously they're very popular the solid

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,670
run humming board edge devices which are

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,730
the first version of the Lennar o light

69
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,579
reference platform the Beagle bone

70
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,319
variants because they're quite good for

71
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,269
IOT Intel dual platform from an x86

72
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,880
point of view and a pion 64 from a

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,340
height of 64 point of view but it's sort

74
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,099
of still a bit up in the air and will

75
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,840
evolve it as things happen

76
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,420
yes so this is basically an overview of

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,460
what the Gateway will be based on a

78
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,700
minimal atomic base image with

79
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,780
containers to add functionality and in

80
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,290
the f26 cycle we'll focus on some

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,160
example containers like an MQTT

82
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,380
container and and also various different

83
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,850
networking technologies both wireless

84
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,990
and wired such as 802 15 for Bluetooth

85
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,050
le and various other open standards

86
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,800
obviously security is a very important

87
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,700
and poignant point when it comes to IOT

88
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,860
and there'll be a focus on things like

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,000
UEFI or opti as part of a secure boot

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,790
and verification so from the moment the

91
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,250
processor boots

92
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,650
whether it's using TPMS on x86 or arm

93
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,450
trusted firmware and various other

94
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,100
technologies like that from the arm

95
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,380
platforms to give us the ability to

96
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,870
verify the entire OS through the boot

97
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,220
process to make sure it hasn't been

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,030
compromised dependency minimization

99
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,700
there's not generally no real need to

100
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,650
ship 3 or 4 TLS stacks for example if

101
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,280
you can ship less you've got less sort

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,150
of coverage and less chance of major CVS

103
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,200
and compromise and things like set comp

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,260
and SELinux toolchain related

105
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,900
functionality sandboxing various systemd

106
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,480
functionalities and the kernel self

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,550
protection project there's a bunch of

108
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,060
different sort of initiatives there that

109
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,160
are helping secure and reduce so and

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,710
even eliminate entire types of sort of

111
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,219
compromised

112
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,060
and then obviously with containers you

113
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,229
can namespace them and isolate them

114
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,880
which means each sort of individual

115
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,789
security service that's running is in an

116
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,440
isolated context with either access

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,300
control or proxy or what-have-you to be

118
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,830
able to access different parts of the

119
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,720
network or different components

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,060
different network isolation technologies

121
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,520
device isolation and policy routing on

122
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
the Gateway level to ensure that if

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
you've got an entire class of device

124
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,539
that you don't want to connect to the

125
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,699
internet that you can identify whether

126
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,220
it be via MAC address or OS

127
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,810
fingerprinting and things like that you

128
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,470
can set up policy routes to either not

129
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,080
route them or isolate them to ensure

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,419
that you know if your acting is the

131
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,669
gateway that these devices can't become

132
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:53,150
part of a botnet or other such Network

133
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,970
support focus on open standards so

134
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,260
things like 802 15 4 rather than

135
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,789
proprietary technology such as ZigBee

136
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,900
and other sort of locking technologies

137
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,389
where you've got a license or patent or

138
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,080
what-have-you

139
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:19,460
6lowpan as a protocol and and various

140
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,979
other and things like older technology

141
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,099
such as rs-485 and someone was asking me

142
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,110
about Modbus the other day can support

143
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:36,740
for controller area networks etc so this

144
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,559
is a sort of general typical wireless

145
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,000
iot topology

146
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,230
as a sort of just a general overview and

147
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,860
so this will be the sort of initial

148
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,129
focus point from my point of view with

149
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:59,420
fedora IOT and some sample containers

150
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,379
open thread and other networking

151
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,309
services MQTT and various other

152
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,990
messaging stacks caching modules and

153
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,209
various middleware and then a selection

154
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:18,660
of possible IOT specific stacks there's

155
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,860
been a couple of people that have been

156
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,350
slowly packaging up node-red and each

157
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,120
time a new release comes out they add a

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,490
few hundred extra dependencies I'm

159
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,540
fairly certain they now depend on over

160
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,769
50% of the the nodejs sort of repository

161
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,199
stack which is I believe one of the

162
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,600
largest repositories in terms of pure

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,399
numbers of libraries on the Internet

164
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,439
so it's it's a very interesting project

165
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,350
but it's vast in terms of I think

166
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,910
they've already packaged up something

167
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,220
like 500 different no js' dependencies

168
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,230
and they're still only a smaller way

169
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,800
there so we may look and see if we can

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,569
just pull that in and run a container

171
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,209
style in the short term while we get all

172
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,199
of that done plus there's some

173
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,410
interesting IOT projects coming out of

174
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,680
the Apache project such as current hanno

175
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,250
and similarly related projects Sawada is

176
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,120
an IO Intel IOT project which is already

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,029
packaged up in fedora and and there's a

178
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,319
number of other ones that people have

179
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,040
shown interest in

180
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,639
so we're just doing a gateway initially

181
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,949
yes but it's just a starting point as a

182
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:40,870
means of doing a proof-of-concept and

183
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,170
driving focus I have a tendency that if

184
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,819
I'm not focused on something in

185
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,370
particular I have lots and lots of ideas

186
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,100
and I'll deliver little bits of lots and

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,689
lots of ideas and we won't end up with

188
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,769
something that's particularly useful it

189
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,009
gives us a good starting base to build

190
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,560
both the put the different options but

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,459
also the community around and it'll be a

192
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,000
combination of industrial IOT and home

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,810
because there's a lot of people

194
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,579
interested in the home side of things

195
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,199
but obviously RedHat from a commercial

196
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,089
point of view it's more focused on

197
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,170
industrial and medical and other such

198
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,810
sort of industry gateways and it'll be

199
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,250
initially a proof-of-concept

200
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,110
as a testing platform nothing set in

201
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,699
stone it will evolve and change as

202
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,589
necessary and as you know people

203
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,660
discover things what are the options

204
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,370
imaging stacks I've had a bunch of

205
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,480
interest around different sort of

206
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,750
embedded devices with cameras used for

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,459
whether it be security and detection of

208
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:57,160
like movement or other sort of OCR style

209
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,370
wrecking like recognition or image

210
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,079
recognition and various other stacks

211
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,160
like that and there's some other

212
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,589
interesting projects where we're having

213
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,529
some discussions with there's an AI

214
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,019
platform called Mycroft which is open

215
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:14,410
source

216
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,230
and they're very interested in working

217
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,839
with us to do some IOT related stuff and

218
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,680
numerous most many ideas to mention like

219
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,240
I come up with a different idea every

220
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,529
other day so so yes in summary I feel

221
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,600
atomic is the right way to go in terms

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,250
of updatable secure devices multiple

223
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,760
texture support from the outset initial

224
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,270
reference devices with focus and based

225
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,670
platform in gateway functionality to

226
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:59,339
start with any questions

227
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,459
so you talk about dependency reduction

228
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,890
so you wouldn't have very many libraries

229
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,470
so that involves not using the standard

230
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,440
fedora bills no no weirdness is like a

231
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,700
different way to get a minimised kind of

232
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,290
so to repeat the question for those that

233
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,740
might be watching online does the

234
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,890
dependency minimization result in

235
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,529
different Fedora packages or Forks of

236
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,120
the package and no it doesn't we'll be

237
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,500
working with the maintainer of those

238
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,060
packages to ensure that that's the case

239
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,160
and there's already other initiatives as

240
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,450
part of yet the intention is to be a

241
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,910
hundred percent within fedora we're

242
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,399
still in the fedora twenty six timeframe

243
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,350
it'll probably be part of the fedora

244
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,500
playground branding but the intention is

245
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,290
to have it eventually as a fully

246
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,920
accepted similar to works workstation

247
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,430
and server and cloud and atomic the

248
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,500
different projects there the intention

249
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
or hope from the discussions that I've

250
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,630
had with the FPL is basically to sort of

251
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:16,060
have it a fully core part of fedora or

252
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,800
at least potentially

253
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,409
[Music]

254
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,740
so the question is around the reference

255
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,040
device support and specific hardware

256
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:55,420
support within those devices so by

257
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,460
default I think all of those reference

258
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,950
well most of those reference devices

259
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,170
either have wireless and Bluetooth or

260
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,980
options of so like the Raspberry Pi 3

261
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,230
has both wireless and Bluetooth and the

262
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,300
humming board has options of wireless

263
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,600
and Bluetooth the Beagle bone now has a

264
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
couple of different models that come

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,560
with both wireless and Bluetooth the

266
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,420
vast majority of them already have can

267
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,870
support actual onboard kin controllers

268
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,470
except for maybe the Intel dual but at

269
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,520
least Soviet so the imx6 has can the

270
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,010
Raspberry Pi doesn't have can out so it

271
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,830
will depend a little bit on the device

272
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,710
and depend a little bit on the matrix of

273
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,100
what we decide to support initially and

274
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,970
we'll adjust devices and support matrix

275
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,480
as we go

276
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:13,720
yeah correct yeah so in the case of like

277
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,379
802 15 4 there's two or three devices

278
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,569
that come with it on board but some of

279
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,609
the different controllers are better or

280
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,569
worse supported upstream and there's a

281
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,489
couple of USB ones that are very well

282
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:37,529
supported which is what so yeah so

283
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:41,439
minissha Lee it will probably be like I

284
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,949
personally have interests in the 802 802

285
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,069
15 for stuff and I have a bunch of

286
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,689
different devices at home with it on

287
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:55,059
board and then but we will probably say

288
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,769
that like initially until there's more

289
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,869
Hardware shipping that will you know

290
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:02,040
recommend the USB

291
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,339
10 the security stuff one thing was

292
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,480
missing was the any connection any

293
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,740
communications over then and that

294
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,569
so the question is around securing SSL

295
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,360
or TLS based services outbound to the

296
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,539
Internet it's not explicitly mentioned

297
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:38,100
on the slide deck but it's essentially

298
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,750
service by service so in the case of

299
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,289
mqtt it supports that out of the box

300
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,100
depending on which broker you're using

301
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,110
the underlying base platform other than

302
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,289
pulling down like the updates won't have

303
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:00,340
any outbound services to note and then

304
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,470
each one will depend on the container

305
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,529
that it's running on does that answer

306
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:25,809
your question Dennis so the question is

307
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,450
about the management of vast amounts of

308
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,559
devices at the moment atomic doesn't

309
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,710
have a general story there but it is

310
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,510
also being worked on as part of that

311
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,419
team so the intention is there to

312
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,809
consume their standard mechanisms of

313
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,590
dealing with it as it's developed it's

314
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,250
certainly something that's on my roadmap

315
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,260
management of devices managers of

316
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,919
devices connected to the Gateway control

317
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,169
of those devices centralized policies

318
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:04,090
centralized updates and yeah it's

319
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,679
probably something that I should put on

320
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,130
the slide deck but it's certainly

321
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,700
something that's like in the future

322
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:37,139
or so the question is looking at

323
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:40,379
projects like lady open wrt whether

324
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:46,859
there's intention to do lessons learn

325
00:19:46,859 --> 00:20:00,479
from most sort of projects possibly on

326
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,119
some some of this is still research some

327
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,580
of this is this is the way we're doing

328
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,899
it in fedora there's certainly different

329
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:13,799
approaches that we can look at there are

330
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,820
I mean projects like open wrt have been

331
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,769
sometimes effective at dealing with

332
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,200
things like security updates and

333
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,830
sometimes not so effective due to

334
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,059
political and social issues within the

335
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,789
project like they're quite often a long

336
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:34,559
way between releases so there's

337
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,889
absolutely things to learn and there's

338
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,710
absolutely ways we can change things to

339
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,889
make it better and the intention sort of

340
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,379
there is to get something working and

341
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,310
then evolve as we go

342
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,389
[Music]

343
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:22,640
that's part of the functionality enough

344
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:56,270
time to do that but the update is like a

345
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,580
delta between the two and you yeah and I

346
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,679
mean that's not that's not up here

347
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,510
specific there are projects that are

348
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,940
using it so like endless mobile is using

349
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,460
it on a Debian based distribution for

350
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,330
their OS as well

351
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
the question is could you use OpenShift

352
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,470
to manage that some of that stuff

353
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,700
potentially

354
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,890
I mean OpenShift is based on kubernetes

355
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,010
and kubernetes is sort of like cluster

356
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,640
technology so you could probably use

357
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,010
applications running on an open shift

358
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,990
platform as a management thing but open

359
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,660
shift itself I'm not sure would be at

360
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,200
least out of the box as it stands now

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,780
necessarily useful but certainly like

362
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,230
for IOT back-end platforms openshift is

363
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,720
like the perfect candidate for running

364
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,180
those side of things but not on not so

365
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,630
much on the actual device any more

366
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,510
questions

367
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,440
excellent I'll let you all go and get

368
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,680
beer
