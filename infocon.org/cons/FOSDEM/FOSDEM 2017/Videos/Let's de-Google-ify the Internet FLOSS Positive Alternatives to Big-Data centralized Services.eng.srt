1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
a

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:10,360
hello everyone so my name is PU and I'm

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,030
not your typical lecturer here in for

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,650
them because I don't cut and not a

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,560
developer I was told that using

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,660
bootstrap doesn't count so no I don't

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,680
code

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,739
I do not bash either when someone asks

9
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,279
me to sudo apt-get install something I

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,020
want to crawl into a neat little hole

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,020
and cry myself to sleep actually I'm a

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,590
writer I've come to the flask community

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,330
writing novels and putting them under

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,870
cc0 public domain license and that is

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,510
why in France for example I belong in

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,410
fromsoft

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,620
so let me introduce you from a soft it's

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,960
mostly a bunch of friends but it's not

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,280
just that from a soft is a non-profit

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,170
French nonprofits who whose people are

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,690
not mainly developers lots of them are

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,479
non developers I can call them digital

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,780
magazine oh we're not from the

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,389
developing world and our goal is to

25
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,179
promote open source freely broken source

26
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,359
software and culture through practical

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,539
projects so that we can be the missing

28
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,609
link between the developers community

29
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,119
and mr. and mrs. everyone the muggles as

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,600
we are so from a soft has been excited

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,569
existing for 15 years now

32
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,499
we have more than 1.5 million visits per

33
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:40,149
month in all of our sites more than 2000

34
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,340
supporters we live from the nation's

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,789
actually so two thousand people well

36
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,060
give us money to do our projects and we

37
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,569
propose nowaday more than 50 practical

38
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,909
projects it's really a huge week we are

39
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,520
small nonprofit 30 members six employees

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,990
it's really small

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,169
but it's really huge in its in what we

42
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:06,249
do we started with a flass directory we

43
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,979
have you USB keys but also a blog

44
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,230
publishing house my novels are published

45
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,959
by foreign asset that's how I came in

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,900
and we also present web services and I

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,400
really

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,920
like this sentence because we don't code

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,870
we facilitate of course we got some

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,420
little things you know it that we

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,709
facilitate for people to use really

52
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,110
really easily free Libre open source

53
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,629
software services and culture and for

54
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,250
two and a half years now our last

55
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,829
project has been to D qualify internet

56
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,689
because we're very modest so let's do

57
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,060
Google if I it not just Google actually

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,340
all Big Data you know Google Apple

59
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,790
Facebook Amazon Microsoft Gotham we call

60
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,030
them and how to do it I want to share

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,609
that with you now because our goal is

62
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,819
that well you try and you copiers and

63
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,040
you adapt it and let's network together

64
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,159
to de-ice the internet together we have

65
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,780
tried in the french-speaking community

66
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,530
it works

67
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,650
spoiler alert so we do it with fact with

68
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,829
floss and with fairy friends first when

69
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,049
you have mr. or mrs. everyone in front

70
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:17,909
of you you have to give them facts you

71
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,769
know those facts oh and Tristan Cole

72
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,260
talked about them this morning

73
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,260
so I'm gonna skim through them financial

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,819
facts in 2016 Apple alphabet Google

75
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,340
Microsoft Amazon and Facebook has been

76
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,760
the four the five most important the

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,090
most important economic powers in the

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,609
world it's no longer a big oil it's no

79
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,609
longer big data Big Pharma and sorry

80
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,940
it's not Monsanto or General Motors its

81
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,940
big data it's the people we give our

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,220
data to who are the richest and the most

83
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,159
powerful financially in the world and

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,470
that must ring a bell - mr. and mrs.

85
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,989
everyone of course there are political

86
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,590
facts we are well Edward Snowden's

87
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,799
revelations has been a huge shock not to

88
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,489
us to us it was like almost paranoid

89
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,010
nightmare coming through true I'm sorry

90
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,880
but well those political mass

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,539
surveillance that is enabled by the

92
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,070
centralization of our data by those

93
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,310
silos silos of data well it was not an

94
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,409
underlying them and Chelsea Manning and

95
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,470
and all those people the rules whistle

96
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,080
it's really important work and when you

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,760
say to people well what do you think

98
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,180
about your state surveying you among

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,630
others well what do you think about that

100
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,850
sometimes in rings about so it's really

101
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,140
a good fact to state there are also

102
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,470
personal fact to use it is that when you

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,540
know that you can be watched upon and

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,630
when you don't know when you are washed

105
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,360
upon well your behavior will change in

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,370
philosophy this is called the panopticon

107
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,820
theory the panopticon can be a prism

108
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,770
like here in Uruguay

109
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,880
I guess Cuba also Cuba thank you thank

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,490
you Tristan so it's in Cuba the

111
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,560
panopticon all the inmates can be washed

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,540
but they never know when the warden will

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,510
wash them so they will have a warden

114
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,140
inside the head the behavior will change

115
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,220
automatically it's not about your will

116
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,380
and use the strength of your will it's

117
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,010
not your subconscious so it's it's it it

118
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,169
doesn't care about your wheel and this

119
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,169
is something that really hits people's

120
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,360
mind when you tell about when you tell

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,150
them about it and finally there is also

122
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,080
a cultural fact I really love this image

123
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,820
it says that when you have a

124
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,160
notification on Facebook Twitter I don't

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,120
care well it's like a slot machine yes

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,330
yes no just three you know and it's

127
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,760
really like that it's designed by

128
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,510
purpose like that there is a wonderful

129
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,810
blog post that I urge you to read by

130
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,600
Tristan Harris called how technology

131
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,919
hijacks people's mind

132
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,030
he's a former design ethicist at

133
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,050
Google's and he went away rightfully and

134
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,650
he tells us how technology is meant to

135
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,590
change our behavior and to decide of the

136
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,010
time that we have in our lives okay so

137
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,040
when you state all those facts to mr.

138
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,300
and mrs. everyone to the widespread

139
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,730
audience usually they are lost

140
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,890
the loss and telling you okay okay right

141
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,140
right I agree with you but what the

142
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,590
do I do

143
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,060
where do I go there is

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,150
only Google just Facebook I cannot

145
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,170
change and it is our duty to present

146
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,790
alternative easy and ready to use

147
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,520
alternative that is what we've done for

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,890
25 years with the Google affair internet

149
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,220
project at foreign soft we have proposed

150
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,860
more than 30 services all of them based

151
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,500
of course on freedom and on open source

152
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,280
software we have edited really easy to

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,450
read user friendly terms and services or

154
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,000
GLG our version of our tensile services

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
is legally binding and it's really easy

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,610
to read you know with sentences that

157
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,330
everyone we tell you well don't take us

158
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,910
for kittens you know don't don't cheat

159
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,830
with us and things like that or nothing

160
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,200
is eternal we can stop at any time as

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,140
any company or nonprofit sometimes it

162
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,010
can stop it can die of course we provide

163
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,890
self hosting documentation because the

164
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,440
point is to have a proof-of-concept you

165
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,710
come you try at all services and then

166
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,560
please install them on your servers and

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,530
of course we provide user documentation

168
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,840
how to do this or that and of course

169
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,600
support when user documentation is not

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,610
enough and support is really an

171
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,370
important thing to do and sometimes we

172
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,740
also walk on the user experience or

173
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,460
ergonomy

174
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,800
of course on translations because not

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,410
every free deep software is available in

176
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,280
French well so well let's do it we can

177
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,990
and so I'm gonna skim through a few

178
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,180
alternatives but we have more than 30

179
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,300
services so just just a few photos so

180
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,310
that you can understand we propose a

181
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,480
Google Doc eternities based on etherpad

182
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,039
well we have lots of it's a bad actually

183
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,620
but is it bad didn't meet our

184
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,110
expectation on one point you couldn't

185
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,789
have an account you know to have a

186
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,280
folder so you can have your parts and

187
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,080
choose which part is public or

188
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,470
confidential or private so well we

189
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,870
needed a plugin well we had a

190
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,000
crowdfunding we hired the developer and

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,750
we paid him to do that and it's called

192
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,700
my pad it's of course available for all

193
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,660
the es pad community we have

194
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,279
more than 30 40 mm baths I'd love 42 in

195
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,019
in my path instance and we are actually

196
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,389
we think the largest bad provider is a

197
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,629
bad provider in France for sure

198
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,029
maybe you know in whole Europe we have

199
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,480
to check but maybe we have also a doodle

200
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,660
alternative there based upon the

201
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,189
software that is called from a date

202
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,350
because it's the one of the few software

203
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,290
we also let developers lead developers

204
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,279
on it and it's really really huge in

205
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,240
France more than 2000 date you know it

206
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,230
doodles are created a day daily in

207
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,660
France so it's really really huge it's

208
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,480
almost youth service and it's quite

209
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
about not earn a sysadmin that you can

210
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,959
ask our system in here hello look it's

211
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,689
it's quite easy to toast actually it's

212
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:00,879
not really demanding Oh perfect

213
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,149
and it's almost you service we also have

214
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,199
both Dropbox and Google Apple calendar

215
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,689
alternative based on next cloud on cloud

216
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:16,689
explode so it's called from a drive for

217
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,730
the Dropbox alternative and from agenda

218
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,170
for the calendar alternative it's to

219
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,360
draw the next cloud instance in

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,730
[Music]

221
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,839
instances one is limited for well

222
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,769
Dropbox type of views with five thousand

223
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,259
accounts limited to five thousand

224
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,449
account and two gigs and the other is

225
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,670
not limited and it's for the agenda but

226
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,009
you don't have file sharing space and

227
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,970
it's more than 6,700 accounts now

228
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,029
actually also the calendar app on next

229
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,879
load didn't meet all our expectations so

230
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,129
that people can use it and do whatever

231
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,889
they want for sharing purposes or

232
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,699
publishing purposes so we had a

233
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,009
developer hired once again

234
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,130
so that we can bring this calendar

235
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,830
to meet our expectations and the

236
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,920
widespread audience expectations we also

237
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
have a gypsy meat alternative skype

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,490
alternative I'm sorry

239
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,230
based undreds Amit of course I want to

240
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,350
talk about this one because most of our

241
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,620
users say it's great it's easier than

242
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,810
Skype I don't have to download the

243
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,520
software I don't have to create an

244
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,310
account I just go to from a talk I

245
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,070
choose the name of my room share the URL

246
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,730
it's done and it works you just need a

247
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,450
good web browser so please use Firefox

248
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,490
you know it's really easy to use and it

249
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,850
talks to people and the free leap can be

250
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,750
really serious alternative to private

251
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,060
software and services so yeah it works

252
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,500
 more than search services it's a

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,360
it's a quotation and a graphic quotation

254
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,980
from a well-known comic in France so we

255
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,130
have more than 30 services and actually

256
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,030
every month in France it's hundreds of

257
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,110
thousands of people who don't use Google

258
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,230
Apple Facebook Amazon Microsoft services

259
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,010
nowadays so it makes a difference that's

260
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,130
why it really amazed us that just 30

261
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,430
people six employees a better act on two

262
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,950
and a half years PR if the budget was

263
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,340
about what five four four hundred

264
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,520
thousand euros on two and a half years

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,820
and hundred of thousand of people are

266
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,360
changing their digital customs you know

267
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,310
in Newsies well the problem is can we

268
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,820
become the next French freely Google or

269
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,660
do we want to no you know we don't

270
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,870
want a centralized Floss internet so we

271
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,390
give a proof of concept the experiment

272
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,240
works please please please let's spread

273
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
it let's decentralize it that's why we

274
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,150
started we need fairy friends I told you

275
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,600
about that we started a collective

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,550
that is called shuttle so it doesn't

277
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,170
work really great a collective of

278
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,110
hosting service services providers who

279
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,180
are transparent open neutral and

280
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,910
solidarity oriented it works really

281
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,760
better in French actually but Chateau is

282
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,610
kitten in French so we think it's really

283
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,540
great we have maybe another try so

284
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,750
kitten

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,080
actually is networking because when we

286
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,210
started doing that other people already

287
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,910
did that you know we have ethical and

288
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,240
free Leibowitz our web services holsters

289
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,230
in France who host mails or websites or

290
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,000
things like that people already did it

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,120
you know so well let's join together

292
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,170
let's regroup forces and let's show to

293
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,260
people a common face the zoo collective

294
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,890
so actually kittens work both as a

295
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,340
ladder label and the network label for

296
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,960
the white sweater audience when you go

297
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,290
and use a kitten service you know that

298
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,390
there will be no advertisement nope

299
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,180
advertisement profiling of course always

300
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,310
free live and open-source software both

301
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,560
for the service and for the system

302
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,380
administration and of course data

303
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,050
friendly terms and services we want user

304
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,990
data it's not our economic model there

305
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,720
are lots of other values that are stated

306
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,240
in our manifesto and commitments upon

307
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,070
those values that are stated you know in

308
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,890
our Charter about net neutrality of

309
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,480
course about transparence you have to be

310
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,780
transparent about economy your economic

311
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,000
model and things like that but it's a

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,880
label so that people know okay this

313
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,370
thing I know what the core values are I

314
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,250
know what the rules are and I I go with

315
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,690
it or I live and for the people in the

316
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,060
collective for and for the companies in

317
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,010
the connectives the non-profit in the

318
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,490
collective well it's also well creative

319
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,580
we are 24 strong now 20 are people 20

320
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,710
kittens wannabe kittens are waiting for

321
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,320
the collective to decide on the

322
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,220
welcoming or not and so by networking we

323
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,459
can

324
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,290
share experience together of course

325
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,660
technical experience but also legal

326
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,509
advice and legal experience and also

327
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,639
lots and lots of things if you want to

328
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,249
ask me how to communicate or how to do

329
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:53,649

330
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,929

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,579
Public Relation together our goal is

335
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:12,249
that the Khitan community is like a free

336
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:14,740
leap software we work on a git or

337
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,740
charter manifesto has been written on a

338
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,179
gate welcoming or not the new kitten it

339
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,279
works on a gate with issues and things

340
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,540
like that you know

341
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,050
so everything of course is free liberal

342
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,850
the charter of the manifesto are under

343
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,839
cc-by-sa license so that if you don't

need you we need kittens we need kittens

350
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,549
everywhere we are starting well to try

351
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,139
and speak English that's why I'm here

352

for example so well if you're interested

353
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,980
or doing something not exactly like this

354
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,319

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,130
everyone case can be different but

362
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,829
together I think we can be more strong

363
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,609
and propose an alternative to change the

364
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,770
Internet as we know it the internet that

365
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,990
is Google Janet that is Facebook Janet

366
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,200

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,409
websites the shaitaan' website is not

370
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,260
translated translated yet but france of

371
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,260
dot-org and on Google eyes dot org works

372
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,020

you're perfect so if you have any

375
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,610
question I can answer them for a few

376
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,309
minutes but then I will have to leave

377
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,620
because my plane is really really soon

378
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,660
but you have please the firmness of team

379
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,550
can you raise your hands if you want to

380
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,370
talk more please you know look at their

381
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,190
faces and they will be happy to talk

382
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,679
with you and there will be more better a

383
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:44,020
technology thing than I how to replicate

384
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,030
thing in developing countries well I

385
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,559
don't know developing countries so I

386
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:55,330
will have to talk with to you yeah

387
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,420
well as I'm telling you I don't know

388
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,309
exactly all those things but I think

389
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,750
they're experienced experiments that we

390
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,980
can take lessons upon for example we we

391
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,230
for the next year we will try to help

392
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,950
people on the rainy on Iceland can I say

393
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,960
rainy on in English it works okay I'm

394
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,420
the Iranian Iceland and they have also a

395
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,760
specific geographical and structural

396
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,920
things that they have to to deal with

397
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,410
you know so we will accompany them and

398
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,910
then we will of course tell the story so

399
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,010
that the experiment can be shared so of

400
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,970
course I can now imagine how to do it

401
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,950
well I'm sure there are solutions that

402
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,050
we can find them together I think there

403
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,300
was a project in India resembling this

404
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,830
one no no it's not working York yet okay

405
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,360
yet okay it's not working

406
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,590
and going yeah well by using there was a

407
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,000
plane by using and I'm sorry I have to

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,620
repeat using freedombox

409
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,990
in small villages in India it can be of

410
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,840
course it can be one way I won't have a

411
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,480
crystal ball and try to see it but I'm

412
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,760
sure there are ways one of them can be

413
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:42,440
that yes of course yeah do we help our

414
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,809
users to migrate from their services to

415
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,650
all services okay yeah because I was

416
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,890
saying you know except if it's if it's a

417
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,770
Google services to our services yes we

418
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,100
have them but when people want to leave

419
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,059
our services we party expecially if it's

420
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,039
to leave our services because they use I

421
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,510
don't know why you know host Michaels a

422
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,720
cloud self hosting people or ones that

423
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,150
they want to go not too firm a soft but

424
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,220
to another kitten you know that what if

425
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,559
our right now of course we help them as

426
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,120
best as we can

427
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,970
it depends off on every free Libre

428
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,130
software and service so I can tell you

429
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,380
specifically right now all as fill of

430
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,990
the service but of course we have them

431
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,510
the best we can because our goal is that

432
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:35,090
you leave us we do want that any other

433
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,940
questions

434
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,890
that was one here I'm sorry I didn't see

435
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,840
you know people don't pay for services

436
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,039
if it's free

437
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,850
you're the project okay okay well if

438
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,650
it's free or kind of the project because

439
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,990
here in France after your project as

440
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,390
your project in Wikipedia for example or

441
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,049
other things like that it's that well

442
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,929
you come and some people must make

443
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,780
donations so that we can go on and give

444
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,720
it us and give it it free for everyone

445
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,870
so

446
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,870
but use as you can see 2,000 people give

447
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,289
us money a year and hands word hundreds

448
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,080
of thousands of people can use it so we

449
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,039
think it's a fair model but of course we

450
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,770
have donations buttons that that are

451
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,159
really apparent and we tell people and

452
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,919
how can you trust us it's always about

453
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,260
trust and it's exactly the question I

454
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,929
mean really it's really important that's

455
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,580
perfect that's what that's what we want

456
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,190
we can't do that but we have a

457
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,049
reputation in France it's we've been

458
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,429
existing for 15 years

459
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,669
so we are strong from this reputation in

460
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,220
the free Lib community world

461
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,730
french-speaking well and we also have

462
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,460
edited really clear and easy to root

463
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,250
terms and services and the Charter so

464
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,649
people can really know what our core

465
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:10,399
value are and every time people are

466
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,980
telling us oh this are you sure thing is

467
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,260
that we respond we are here and we

468
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,210
discuss with them but our goal is that

469
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,240
people leave Earth's for example go to a

470
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,220
kitten because the kitten there is a map

471
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,240
and you can see where is the ethical

472
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
foster close by to your house and it's

473
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,630
really important because you can talk

474
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:55,070
with them okay so the problem is when

475
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,840
the initiative comes from France it's

476
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,580
really hard to keep up and to keep it

477
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:09,529
dated into other languages well we are

478
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:12,799
trying to do our best to to to meet this

479
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,809
challenge right now that's that's our

480
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:15,289
goal

481
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,049
right now actually in finest art I can

482
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:20,899
talk for the whole French community you

483
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:24,260
know but we are trying to do that right

484
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,080
now and we

485
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,810
love if anyone else from the

486
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,540
english-speaking community will take the

487
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,980
lead about that and we will just

488
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,560
participate and share on what whenever

489
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,660
we can all our experience and things

490
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,620
like that but we would love that yeah

491
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,730
it's the times that okay

492
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:51,579
[Applause]
