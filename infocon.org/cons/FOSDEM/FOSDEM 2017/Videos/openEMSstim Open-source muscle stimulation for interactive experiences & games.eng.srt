1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
[Applause]

2
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,830
all right first of all things Jessie for

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,620
organizing this like open dev room for

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,030
games which is really cool to have it

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,219
here at the open source conference all

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,949
right so my name is Pedro and I'm a

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:20,449
research and human-computer interaction

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:21,830
I work at this place called the hustle

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,440
up Institute which is in possum which is

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,980
very close to Berlin in Germany and so

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,060
like you're probably wondering now hey

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,620
like there's a faker in the room because

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,180
you're not a game developer and that's

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,628
true

15
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,309
and the games that I'm gonna show are

16
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,289
like super super lame you just saw like

17
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,840
I've made some unity and the pong in

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,150
unity it's just like really horrible but

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,250
hopefully you'll kind of agree by the

20
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,220
end of the talk that maybe like the idea

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,070
of using more of kind of muscle based

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,110
first feedback is interesting for the

23
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,970
future of games becoming really physical

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,290
and we just saw like really interesting

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,570
example today with a tangible world and

26
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,090
also I'm here because I made this tool

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,700
kit which is called the open EMS stim

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,660
with the help of other people and I'll

29
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,280
talk about as well and this is fully

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,570
open source and open hardware I just

31
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,560
want to share that with you because that

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,899
might inspire you so first I need a

33
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:10,640
brave volunteer that wants to play a

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,979
very special pong come here

35
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,770
all right so you are the blue player so

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,030
you should send here and yeah it's gonna

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,640
be fun all right all right so what's

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,960
gonna happen is that electrical

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,850
stimulation is going to try to pull your

40
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,300
hand up words as you playing pong are

41
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,950
you guys just really hard for you to see

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,740
but we're gonna use you're gonna use the

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,350
onl to move the pedal up and down and

44
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,619
I'm gonna use this one's good so you can

45
00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:09,330
start it demonstrate that this is like a

46
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,670
really lame game because I'm a bad game

47
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,209
programmer but I'm gonna lose one again

48
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,360
just for you guys can see it so you

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
could do that for like tens of a seconds

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:37,050
or something if you're just a researcher

51
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,380
doing basic technology have no idea all

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,790
right so there will be more demos along

53
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,180
the way

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,040
so what is this all about um disclaimer

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,450
is that all these projects I'm going to

56
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,220
show our research projects in HCI they

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,410
don't like you're not no products and

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,480
nothing is built on this or sold to

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,180
Apple or something like that that uses

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,100
muscle stimulation but I think they

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,260
offer an investigation of how these

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,820
these things could look in the future

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,070
and could potentially make interfaces

64
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,260
more physical so all the prototypes that

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,400
you see here these type of devices which

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,769
are medical compliant muscle stimulator

67
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,930
so you might have from your doctor to do

68
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,430
rehabilitation of your muscles so if you

69
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,709
have like a degenerative disease or even

70
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,030
if you're just filling up muscle tissue

71
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,190
because you had broken leg and you have

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,570
your leg in the cast or something your

73
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,860
your doctor might give you something

74
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,170
like this technology that is very old

75
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,840
comes from the 60s forward onwards from

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,300
really to rehabilitation medicine this

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,040
is just a little example like me

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,080
controlling one of each of my other

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,680
fingers

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,860
by over by a smartphone all right

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,780
so what types of games this is enable

82
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,180
the first thing we built with this was

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,939
just a game that have four seems like a

84
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,409
contradiction if you think of arcade

85
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:54,299
machines back but it's my own muscles

86
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,920
that does the force feedback

87
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,420
and so the device is actually pretty

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,500
small and sits in the back of a

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,750
smartphone you already saw that it can

90
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,819
actuate like the fingers can also

91
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,610
actuate the wrist and whatnot and if you

92
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,200
think I'm playing a little game here I'm

93
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,540
trying to fly an airplane and when the

94
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,030
windmill comes my airplane gets derailed

95
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,040
but that's involuntary it just moves by

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,660
itself and now I have to fight that and

97
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,940
put the airplane back into trajectory

98
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,220
all right so it's a very simple kind of

99
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,400
approach to having force feedback now if

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
you think about it what it's kind of

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
interesting is that the device is really

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,510
tiny it's just has no motors no

103
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,160
actuators it's this little thing now it

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,590
looks a little bit different because

105
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,970
there is a way to create force feedback

106
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,860
sensations it's called an exit skeleton

107
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,960
there's other ways as well this is the

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,430
most portable one that you have which is

109
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,560
using motors pull these big batteries a

110
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,080
lot of electricity amps of power to be

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,120
able to externally move your muscles so

112
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,800
what we're doing isn't exactly doing the

113
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,750
same thing a little bit less power

114
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,550
because we just use a 9-volt battery and

115
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,470
we just send these tiny impulses your

116
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,120
muscles and they do the job by

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,169
themselves because you have all the

118
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,530
hardware already all right so this

119
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,120
essentially allows you to do the force

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,910
feedback in a semi wearable or mobile

121
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,890
form factor now the question is working

122
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,560
this way also be useful and the question

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,700
becomes really obvious these days

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,470
because VR it's moving in towards the

125
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,090
real walking so not that you're just

126
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,950
with the headset sitting in front of a

127
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,630
computer we're starting to walk and

128
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,479
physical spaces in VR that's called real

129
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,550
walking and I think like VR is an really

130
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,080
really interesting a step right now

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,300
because what you see is like super

132
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,130
believable if you look up there I put

133
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,320
this HUD there but if I hadn't put that

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,850
thing there this would be like a picture

135
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,770
of a neuron probably like some forest in

136
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,160
Germany but so graphics is really

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,720
realistic but the sensations you have

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,660
are kind of boring in VR you walk around

139
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,330
you touch all these air spaces and it's

140
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,669
all like kind of haptic listless right

141
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,720
so there's nothing there

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,340
maybe there should be a wall in there

143
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,200
because the normal games have walls that

144
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,360
we just saw you can also paint them in

145
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,220
 maybe there should be a boxer there

146
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,350
that kind of punches you through I mean

147
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,030
there should be like physical effects if

148
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,650
you're seeing physical realities right

149
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,080
if the game is about ghosts that's all

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,669
fine if you touch nothing but if the

151
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:04,900
game has a ball we should touch the wall

152
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,700
and if the game has a boxer you should

153
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,729
feel

154
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,189
punches so I'm gonna tackle both so

155
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,860
first let's cycle the boxing example so

156
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,360
this is impact oh this is a project we

157
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
did a year ago or so then which seating

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,889
is my colleague staging he's actually

159
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,419
feeling the punches from this virtual

160
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,849
avatar boxer we've done with this set of

161
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,979
maze and the way he's actually feeling

162
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,830
that that is because we're trying to

163
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,270
render this same sensation right the

164
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,499
sensation of impact and there's two

165
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,759
things about that if something touches

166
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,219
me here there's a tactile component my

167
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,809
skin and there's a force that moves me

168
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,029
backwards so we render them separately

169
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,919
we have a little solenoid that taps your

170
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,330
skin right taps your skin and we also

171
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,889
have the muscle stimulation that pushes

172
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,689
your arm backwards if you combine both

173
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,159
you'll give an illusion to your brain

174
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,659
that it was there was a tactile

175
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,189
sensation here and a sufficient force

176
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,990
that pushed your backwards and your

177
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,550
brain is going to interpret that as well

178
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,990
this force was big enough to move me

179
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,539
backwards so he's feeling those forces

180
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,520
in that game feels like a boxer hitting

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,039
him he can also hit back and stuff like

182
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,120
that I'll show a little bit more about

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,639
that later so in fact what kind of those

184
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,990
this is in a sort of wearable form

185
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,399
factor and I would tell you this that

186
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,509
amazed with people was really

187
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,560
interesting because you know like they

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,999
were like hardcore gamers so they were

189
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,219
jumping around and going out of the

190
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,330
tracking balling and things that we've

191
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,279
never done which was really cool always

192
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,270
just played like this

193
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,310
the people were really engaging on the

194
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,039
kind of physical level and the key for

195
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,509
this is really the muscle stimulation as

196
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,999
you saw in the previous one the solenoid

197
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,680
that we actually used is something super

198
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,330
tiny it's even smaller than all the ones

199
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,639
here because if you wanted like

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,770
something to push through and feel like

201
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,599
a boxer you would end up with a robotic

202
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,399
arm that would hit you with I don't know

203
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,110
100 Newtons a thousand Newtons or

204
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,580
something would probably break you as

205
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,830
well our solenoid when we measured it's

206
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,189
something like 200 grams this is like

207
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,589
it's nothing but because of the muscle

208
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,419
stimulation it tricks you so we played

209
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,279
around with different sensations you've

210
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,990
seen the arms already what's interesting

211
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,370
that is actually it can actually hit

212
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,759
back as well so if you put a little

213
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,199
redirecting thing for the solenoid or 3d

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,629
printing lever you can kind of like feel

215
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,050
like you hit the boxer as well we've

216
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,789
heard a little bit of a juggling

217
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,680
football thing that's kind of cool by

218
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,839
putting the solenoid in the foot and the

219
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,819
muscle stimulation under like so in the

220
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,740
ball hits you your foot kind of goes

221
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,009
down

222
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,060
[Music]

223
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,780
to feel all those impacts for the ball

224
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,830
all right

225
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,840
combinations you can hit back with your

226
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,340
legs I'm gonna jump that one

227
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,229
it's like Thai boxing and this one is my

228
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,110
favorite if you put the solenoid onto

229
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,490
like a random prop it could be this

230
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,500
water bottle the vibration is going to

231
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,790
be when it hits it's going to be

232
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,320
propagated through here then we're going

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,640
to put the muscle stimulation still in

234
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,460
your arm so we can do move your arm and

235
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,950
that creates things like baseball right

236
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,440
so you feel like something hit the bat

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
but it's your arm that goes backwards so

238
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,960
it feels like that ball like kind of

239
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,230
force

240
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,790
and this one's kind of fun to play tor a

241
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,230
little bit around with the visuals as

242
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,870
well so that's just a dummy thing that

243
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,029
you're just holding like a filer but in

244
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,620
reality in the game you could be holding

245
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,160
a bat ping-pong paddle fencing sword

246
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,540
different kind of props that represent

247
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,089
physical realities the hardest one that

248
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,529
we just this is recent we're gonna

249
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,230
publish this soon and this is trying to

250
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,730
investigate what if you could create

251
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,529
walls so like making games even more

252
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,149
physical by creating obstacles like

253
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,579
heavy objects and walls so this one asks

254
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,839
the following question what if there was

255
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,260
a wall there and seating could like feel

256
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,649
it somehow

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,839
so this is a longer experience in what

258
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,129
we're doing is using the muscle

259
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,360
stimulation to try to pull your

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,790
backwards to not enter like large

261
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,379
objects like electro walls like this

262
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:58,319
this button here as you push it you feel

263
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,670
the resistance and you're trying to like

264
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,868
push the soft button through

265
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,220
there's like a cannon now that should

266
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,410
like propellers that you or things like

267
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,570
that and so you also feel them like just

268
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,130
an impact over your hands go backwards

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,700
and the most interesting one I was just

270
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,050
going to skip a little bit this is

271
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,920
actually a very large the our experiment

272
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,360
you can be in this world for a while

273
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,560
so this I find kind of cool you actually

274
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,570
when you grab the cube you you try to

275
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,920
push through because you don't know

276
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,690
where your cube is and the system stops

277
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,920
you at the moment where you actually

278
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,590
face the cube also it pulls you down

279
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,110
words to emulate the gravity right term

280
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,490
you like the weight under the gravity

281
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,290
that the cube would would do so you feel

282
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,060
some resistance which is kind of cool

283
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,010
because when you throw it it is easier

284
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,390
actually to throw a cube because you

285
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,400
just feel like oh now I don't have this

286
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,520
forces so I don't know what's happening

287
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,530
all right so this is kind of the part

288
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,960
that we do as research and as I started

289
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,180
to try to experiment and give this to my

290
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,950
friends to other research is that I face

291
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,050
the obvious problem is which is all

292
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,280
these things that I showed you we're

293
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,250
things that I engineered myself and it's

294
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,480
not like it can give it to you and say

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
like oh just activate this command and

296
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,600
this pin and this is gonna work really

297
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,690
well just as an example the bracelet is

298
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,070
actually not that complicated but in the

299
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,360
end of the day it's pretty custom-made

300
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,610
so there's a processor there similar to

301
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,740
an Arduino there's a bluetooth there's

302
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,470
the muscle stimulator there's a way to

303
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,880
control the muscle stimulator without

304
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,650
hacking it that's somehow it will find

305
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,090
really important about what about my

306
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,830
contribution here is that I don't you

307
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,930
see like this thing is not open wide and

308
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm not like taking out a capacitor and

309
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,960
putting another one that I don't really

310
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,870
know what it is so I try to just

311
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,070
modulate the amplitude that comes from

312
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,020
this one so if if this one is medical

313
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,430
compliant at least I'm kind of medical

314
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,950
compliant as well it's very safe for you

315
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,490
to use it there's batteries these things

316
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,120
are not medical compliant thanks well

317
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,260
accelerometers and in the case of the of

318
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,210
impact oh that was a solenoid obviously

319
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,130
there's always the electrons so now I

320
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,660
was starting like how can I share this

321
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,160
amongst others and actually jesse was

322
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,920
was a key person in this because I was

323
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,380
invited by gamma dia and Jesse to give a

324
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,960
workshop at the eye gamer 2014 I didn't

325
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,790
even have the kit back then it was just

326
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,830
they all built something like this with

327
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,450
relays and potentiometers and whatnot

328
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,180
and and it kind of give me an idea okay

329
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,770
I like I have to structure this on how

330
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,240
in an open source way so people can

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,640
actually reuse it and then the the other

332
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,350
side of stories that I saw a lot of

333
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,820
people online they kind of like my work

334
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,980
and they were like trying to replicate

335
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,010
or tinker with it and they were kind of

336
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,970
putting some things in the wrong way and

337
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,200
I was like okay maybe they can hurt

338
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,650
themselves

339
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,660
let me start doing workshops or at least

340
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,110
like publish everything in a way

341
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,390
it's fully available they can understand

342
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,070
at least my decisions and there might be

343
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,810
wrong decisions too but at least my

344
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,959
decisions so that allowed to create this

345
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,330
thing that we call open EMS Tim the

346
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,670
boards were designed by max and Tim made

347
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,010
by me and Max and Tim and then I remix

348
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,930
this into to the version that it is now

349
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,610
max is he it was at the time at the

350
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,649
University of Hanover he's not Munster

351
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,910
and his research is also super

352
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,980
interesting so if you have time and it

353
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,209
slides out online you can check his

354
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,760
stuff and then what I really did was I

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,649
created this board for a competition at

356
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,019
the UI SD conference we call it West

357
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,750
Conference where it's like a game jam

358
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,950
kind of thing where students come

359
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,450
together in teams and they build

360
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,680
prototypes and then they demo at the

361
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,390
conference and so this was the hardware

362
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,630
chosen for the last competition that's

363
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,640
why I kind of remakes and made it open

364
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,440
source and so forth so what does the

365
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,850
hell does this war do and why is it

366
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,899
connected to this thing

367
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,550
so I told you guys that this is a muscle

368
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,769
stimulator this just creates a signal

369
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,570
that would activate muscle fibers one

370
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,120
collective connected to electrodes and

371
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,680
this thing is essentially just a way to

372
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,690
computer control it so it sits in the

373
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,100
middle right now it's connected by an

374
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,490
via this way but could be connected

375
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,899
while you just buy a battery inside

376
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,899
doesn't have to be over cereal so just a

377
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,720
little 9-volt battery and all this thing

378
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,279
does is to modulate the signals and has

379
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,110
an Arduino inside and has a Bluetooth

380
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,630
but it could have other things and has

381
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,740
an understanding of how to modulate

382
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,870
these signals without potentially being

383
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,310
dangerous to you all right so that's

384
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,050
that it's what it does it controls the

385
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,540
amplitude of a haptic input this is just

386
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,490
a screenshot of the github you have all

387
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,100
I kind of walk through on how to use it

388
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,930
how to build in and so forth so who has

389
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,970
used it so far I mean before there were

390
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,860
people like at the game jam at a gamer

391
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,510
and so forth but this particular version

392
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,459
has been used by all the teams of this

393
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,829
competition and I just wanted out stress

394
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,779
how few of the projects it was really

395
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,959
incredible stuff they build let me say

396
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,190
all right so this was one of my

397
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,100
favorites they didn't win though this

398
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,449
was rock-paper-scissors

399
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,760
there was a leap motion controller so

400
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,620
with one hand you would select what do

401
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,089
you want to do like I want the scissor

402
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,070
and the other hand is computer control

403
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,540
you just play against your other hand

404
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,810
you're like

405
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,459
it was and it was working pretty pretty

406
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,010
darn well it's hard to make the Caesar

407
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,120
gesture so they just kind of

408
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,190
approximated a gesture then they

409
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,329
considered to be a scissor like

410
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:05,800
something like that but the

411
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
implementation it was really great the

412
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,010
leap controller the way they did it was

413
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,389
kind of even detecting a little bit

414
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,160
before you actually finished your

415
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,630
gesture was like three two one and like

416
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,699
in the 2.5 would already had the fighter

417
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,240
with what to use again this was really

418
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,800
cool and this would by the way Hays

419
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,410
rifle and he thought he was our sponsor

420
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,329
he's a Google VR they kind of sponsored

421
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,740
the whole competition and he's trying

422
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,300
the project that actually won the

423
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,519
competition which is called a vibrato so

424
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,230
they were teaching people how to do this

425
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,660
vibrato effect where he like I don't

426
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,310
know how to do it would your voice by

427
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,470
using muscle stimulation here and Hayes

428
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,209
was also trying it on on his neck

429
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,430
muscles and they made a karaoke machine

430
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,829
that was essentially not just show you

431
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,449
letters but at some point automate the

432
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,220
vibrato and like - it was really good I

433
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,050
think these guys also won an award this

434
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,970
was an air guitar I call it the first

435
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,820
real air guitar so your muscles would

436
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,490
essentially move automatically to any

437
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,390
beat that you would play in the

438
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,860
smartphone so he also created like a

439
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,589
tracker for 4/4 beat on sets and so

440
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,540
forth yeah a lot of cool stuff some

441
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,079
hololens things a lot of VR VR immersive

442
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,170
experiences were also made this is an

443
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,920
interesting one

444
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,029
it kind of makes you smile while in VR

445
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,040
but that's my advisor as well and one of

446
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,839
my favorites talking about alternative

447
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,820
game controllers and physical tangible

448
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,199
orbs and things like that was a

449
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,600
ping-pong paddle that it was just for a

450
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,240
physical ping-pong game to to person but

451
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,890
I could hold the smartphone with my

452
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,279
other hand and send like evil kind of

453
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,690
things like shake shake your hand now

454
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,220
and you're like trying to play but your

455
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,870
hand goes

456
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,000
and he had a limited number of power-ups

457
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
that you could use and things like that

458
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,310
so it was it was a very interesting

459
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,950
augmentation of ping pong okay so how to

460
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,770
use it it accepts commands by a

461
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,140
Bluetooth 4.0 so that's the low energy

462
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,240
that's what most smartphones have right

463
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,730
now then and also accept serial and

464
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,500
there's an on-board Arduino that kind of

465
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,640
does that part so just to show you how

466
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,839
the Bluetooth part works

467
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,879
all right so turn this one off

468
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,669
so

469
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,880
because it also simplifies people just

470
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,050
trying it out for their first time

471
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,089
because it's easier to like do it over a

472
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,310
computer so if you want you can tap on

473
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,070
one of those buttons I'll probably feel

474
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,940
something yeah yeah so the longer you

475
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,350
tap the longer I feel that was very

476
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,560
short yeah so that's this one that's

477
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,880
this one so you can pass it along at

478
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,270
some point so that's interesting because

479
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,180
people can build games just out of even

480
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,560
just that controller which is like

481
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,900
Wizard of Oz kind of just experimenting

482
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,430
you don't even have to build a full game

483
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,610
just a game can be like a set of rules

484
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,590
and then if something happens it does

485
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,600
that one team also build a board game

486
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,150
which I found really cool that when

487
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,590
you're just playing at a normal board

488
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,210
game and at some point something happens

489
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,120
and you're am kind of goes left alright

490
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,030
so that that was cool and then yeah you

491
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,610
can also do it over over USB and we can

492
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,570
try to do something kind of fun here

493
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,690
alright we still have some minutes so

494
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,520
let me see if I can pull this off

495
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,130
let me see if this is running so let me

496
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,700
kill this one

497
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,450
so it's so hard to double screen so

498
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,700
where we leave this one

499
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,870
it's

500
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,230
all right I think I need my phone again

501
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,430
who has my phone because I think that's

502
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,860
my hotspot oh you guys lowered the

503
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,070
amplitude that's why I wasn't feeling it

504
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,400
all right

505
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,190
that's what how I connected to the

506
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,260
hotspot oh I can't see that let's hope

507
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,650
that I am

508
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,170
okay yeah I am connected but I didn't

509
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,530
feel anything

510
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,950
let's try that again it's a little

511
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,720
tricky on the big screen right Fred

512
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,529
Oh PowerPoint crest that's kind of fine

513
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,850
alright so the board needs a little bit

514
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,120
of time to set up the Bluetooth usually

515
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,530
so here you see one of the one of the

516
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,690
interfaces which is I made it small it's

517
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,280
not anybody API just a little interface

518
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,970
for nodejs

519
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,670
so people can also like do this through

520
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,050
these things over the browser and

521
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,080
okay I felt that one yeah so when you

522
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,210
load this page is just like zaps me so

523
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,700
if you would if you would go to my IP

524
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,679
address which I would have on the slides

525
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,360
but we just lost the slides right of the

526
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,840
slides probably

527
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,290
[Music]

528
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,940
I'll keep it running so maybe it will

529
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,000
work

530
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,710
Wow

531
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,810
maybe should jump this one we already

532
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:46,409
went a long way that's nice

533
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,139
so here we are

534
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,650
so yeah if you would go to this address

535
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,030
but do you have to log into the my

536
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,740
phone's Wi-Fi so that will take too long

537
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,650
but I would feel your HTTP gets alright

538
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,050
so that sounds complicated API is it's

539
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,550
nothing really like I made api's but

540
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,030
what I made was a bit of like module for

541
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,420
Python like a very simple nodejs kind of

542
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,780
library I also do the processing unity3d

543
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,630
and time is up so I'll just jump this is

544
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,250
just screenshots from the github so all

545
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,320
these things are on line if you want to

546
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,180
make one it's not super hard there's

547
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,130
also a tutorial online on how to bake

548
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,830
your own board and make one we have only

549
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,270
a very limited amount but if you really

550
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,710
need one you can send me an email

551
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,780
I'll try to make one for you and yeah we

552
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,320
make them like this so that's the end I

553
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,270
hope you kind of enjoy this thing if you

554
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,400
want to learn more about this you can

555
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,440
always organize workshops either with me

556
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,480
or just by yourself and I'll just help

557
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
you online on how to set these things up

558
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,350
organized game jams like the commedia

559
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,190
has done and if you want to get involved

560
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,570
there's a lot of hardware that needs

561
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,190
improvement and in software definitely

562
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,110
and mostly you should just make a lot of

563
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,270
weird games yeah that's it I want to

564
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,590
show one more thing so I'll sacrifice

565
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,380
question time if you like weird games I

566
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,660
think this is this is the one that you

567
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,160
like the most this is a game without a

568
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,020
screen it's this children's game that

569
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,730
you normally play with two people you

570
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,920
try to slap each other but here Patrick

571
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,360
is playing against the computer so that

572
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,910
hand is the computer and that's his hand

573
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,610
and this is really really hard to win

574
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,890
because you have no reaction time to

575
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,530
kind of run away from the computer so

576
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,030
there's an interesting also game design

577
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,500
challenge on how to design a game that

578
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,940
has no screen and just works on your

579
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,250
body and works on your muscles yep

580
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,520
that's it

581
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:47,029
[Applause]

582
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,779
that's a great question so you do so

583
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,039
there's a lot of things that require

584
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,570
like knowledge of what you're what

585
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,669
you're doing so you do need to have a

586
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,700
sense of the anatomy and the things in

587
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,169
the arm are really easy and then things

588
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,490
in the rest of the body get really

589
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,529
complex because muscles are very layered

590
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,630
and things like that so there's

591
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,460
electrode placement charts for all these

592
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,779
machines and all the muscles you want to

593
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,669
actuate and that's usually the best way

594
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,269
to to do it and the question for those

595
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,220
at home was how do you know where the

596
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,450
muscles are that you want to actuate

597
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:29,169
where you place the electrodes so

598
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,600
question is question is what is the EMS

599
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,399
device outputting so there's a lot of

600
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:34,840
people that also build their own and

601
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,789
just output simple sine waves or output

602
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,100
square waves the medical way to do it is

603
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,450
to output a thing called a biphasic

604
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,159
waveform that looks a little bit like a

605
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,490
sine wave but has a very long tail

606
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,899
definitely a seed has to be that was up

607
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,830
and down but has a very long tail which

608
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,029
now I would take ten minutes to explain

609
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,769
but it allows your muscles to do a

610
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,360
certain process that they need with that

611
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,669
inverse inverse also the negative part

612
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,610
of the wave so yeah you can totally use

613
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,620
like these these your self kind of

614
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,750
things but like if you want to be on the

615
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,889
safe side and have a really good

616
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:08,559
experience these medical devices that

617
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,760
I'll put that particular waveform

618
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,000
this thing costs 20 years how expensive

619
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,240
is the DMS device 20 years and to make a

620
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,550
kit like this the most expensive part is

621
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,560
the Arduino so depends on how cheap your

622
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,900
Arduino is our might out of that ripoffs

623
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,490
would be non FTDI driver for dollars but

624
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:39,510
and the driver sucks yeah question is

625
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,190
how much can you miniaturize I think the

626
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,650
answer is a lot like really really a lot

627
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,280
this is you know self engineer kind of

628
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,490
not not an e student kind of kind of

629
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,680
technology like this could be a computer

630
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,690
chip that big amplifiers are always

631
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,970
given be a certain size so this has high

632
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,650
voltage amplifiers that do something

633
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,780
like from your very small 5 volt signal

634
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,080
to like 40 volt 50 volt and that will

635
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,370
always have a certain size it's a

636
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,280
transformer but we're talking about you

637
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,320
know something like this it could be

638
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,940
very small like being a SmartWatch could

639
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,840
be in a bracelet form-factor yeah

640
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,730
okay thank you so much

641
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:26,680
[Applause]
