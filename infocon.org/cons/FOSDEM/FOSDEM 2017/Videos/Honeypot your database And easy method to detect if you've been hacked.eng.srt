1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,980
okay let's get going right so my name is

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,969
Kirby called you know I am a senior

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,769
development manager or what used to be a

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:20,779
team late in the autumn SQL lace I stood

5
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:24,289
with masks you starting in 2006 well

6
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,880
still happily come on Korea's right so

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,949
we are going to talk today about

8
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,760
something different so this is not a

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,730
brilliant technical achievement it's a

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,870
way to basically hunt so a bit of a

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,350
different subject right so this is the

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,579
this is a thing that just demonstrates

13
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,579
ideas it's not there for you to make

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,250
decisions based on it it will just

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,320
demonstrate some options that you can

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,390
take with my skill all right

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,160
so honeypotted how many of you please

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,410
raise your hands if you ever did

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,539
anything with information security great

20
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,009
great great

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,729
so to quote a book the book of all

22
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,520
knowledge a honeypot is a computer

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,130
security mechanism set to detect deflect

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,009
or in some manner counteract attempts to

25
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,520
of unauthorized use of information

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,819
system so basically I like the

27
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,869
definition and we are going to now

28
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,880
examine what these words mean the one

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,410
involved the boat is mine actually

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,160
alright so detect basically you have

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,640
something that people want and you have

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,080
a you have an alarm attached to it so

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,349
whenever somebody tries to access to the

34
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:00,800
honey

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,500
you get a neuron that's detecting

36
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,119
I think it's a bit different you still

37
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,410
have the the valuable parts but you once

38
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,930
people starts trying to get those things

39
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,930
you get them into fairyland basically

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,980
you show them unicorns rainbows

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,940
well flux you know basically people

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,830
think they are doing the real stuff but

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,620
they are actually well taking karate in

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,530
your theme park pretty much right so and

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,560
counteract this is a bit culture there's

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,370
no unicorns there just two big old truck

47
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,069
so whenever somebody tries to access the

48
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,849
honey you catch them that's plain and

49
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:55,730
simple okay so let's do the text with

50
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:03,140
MySQL right so we set already we had we

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,349
had the honey and we have the Bell so

52
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,190
Connie is data that's easy I mean you

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,840
people are after your data when they

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,060
attack my scale they don't want anything

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,730
else pretty much but you you need the

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,849
buzzer you need to put something that

57
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,849
will allow you when people attack your

58
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,049
data so that's what I'm going to show

59
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,530
you it's a simple plug-in that I wrote

60
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,970
it's probably 20 lines of code

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,609
it's an audit log plugin those of you

62
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,109
that be that have been to markets

63
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:43,790
session he was talking about the same

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,959
kind of plugin so it's a pretty

65
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,910
versatile way of doing things in my

66
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,329
scale basically it reacts to a lot of

67
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,750
events inside the server so you can use

68
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,030
it to do pretty much interesting things

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,629
a lot of interesting things actually

70
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,359
right so what's the idea the idea is

71
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,769
that if an on DBA

72
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,950
access access is a predefined attractive

73
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,600
table then the plugin will

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,820
like that it will walk a special message

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,490
for the DBR into the roadblock and it

76
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,829
will start rejecting comforter commands

77
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,580
basically the alarm is on and you are in

78
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,170
panic mode right so it's couple of lines

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,960
of code I can actually show you some of

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,850
that and it's pretty easily customizable

81
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,540
this second definition here it's it does

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,340
not have to be that it can be whatever

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,310
you like it to do but well this is for

84
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,920
demonstration purposes only so it's it's

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,910
a good goal right so this is how the

86
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,370
code looks it's not too small but okay

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,530
so here are the important parts this is

88
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,630
a audit log plugin this is the panic

89
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,930
mode part so if it is in panic mode and

90
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,010
you are not super tops it walks you

91
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,440
right there this is the checking part

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,260
right here so this is what triggers the

93
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,980
condition it checks whether the we are

94
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,160
accessing tables and whether we have set

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,470
up the plug-in so we have a table and a

96
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,110
day in database value and then if we

97
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,840
have those it checks the values against

98
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,320
the table that is being supplied and if

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,130
it matches then it enters panic mode so

100
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,180
in panic noted sets the panic mode

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,750
locks and lost the message and then

102
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,150
tells the server to basically stop

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,380
executing the current command right so

104
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,770
this is the code it's on github you can

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,170
play with it as much as you like so can

106
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,250
you compile it

107
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,660
you take the the github repository put

108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,850
it in take a mask you source

109
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,280
distribution or a gift ring you can just

110
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
count the mask you source from there and

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,270
you put the code that is there the C

112
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,980
file and the Simek file into this

113
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,750
directory plugin

114
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,390
how'd it require and then you compile as

115
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,380
you normally do

116
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,760
so this will end up with a with the

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,830
shared library the plug-in shared

118
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,750
library that you can load in inside the

119
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,420
server there's more details on to that

120
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,600
URL the process is distracting details

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,550
you can just follow the step step

122
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,910
alright so this is how it this is fun

123
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,640
setting it up looks like we so we

124
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,100
basically create human resources

125
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,220
database it does have to look at active

126
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,500
so we create a human resource salaries

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,920
table and we eventually put some data

128
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,860
into it and then we grant all privileges

129
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,860
on to it to pretty much everybody that's

130
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,840
logged in to the system this is a

131
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,080
special construct here which applies

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,620
this privilege to all users current and

133
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,910
future users right so we also set up the

134
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,780
buzzer we store the plug-in itself and

135
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,050
we set the table to be the the salaries

136
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,420
table name and the database to be the HR

137
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,940
so basically what this means is that

138
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,340
every access to that table will trigger

139
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,230
our buzzer right so we have the two

140
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,780
components of detection as mentioned

141
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,960
already

142
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,880
okay so we have some unexpected visitors

143
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,229
typically malicious users they do

144
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,060
something that is called lateral

145
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,650
movement so what are the moment is you

146
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,900
use some legitimate ways to log into the

147
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,600
database or to the object under attack

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,080
and then you start trying to see what

149
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,310
else can you do

150
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,500
aside from the privileges that you know

151
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,840
you have so this is called lateral

152
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,520
movement because you kind of move

153
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,090
sideways and try to realize what is

154
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,610
there okay so the user starts with the

155
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,289
lateral movement by showing called

156
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,020
databases they want to see what

157
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,929
databases they have access to and they

158
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,240
say oh okay HR that's interesting right

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,429
so they switch to HR and they try to

160
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,010
show the tables in it that's also fine I

161
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,600
mean that is a salary table and it works

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,160
there's no access to the sorry paper

163
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,350
just yet so it works okay

164
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,410
so create table that works too right

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,450
sounds attractive there is a salary cone

166
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,339
so okay great

167
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:13,220
even better data according to Kim to

168
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,470
extract so they start with the

169
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,839
extraction they start with the select

170
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,950
from salaries and what they get is this

171
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,430
arrow here that's our part in kicking

172
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,930
kill and then every subsequent command

173
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,110
that they enter is also about it because

174
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,589
the parking has entered panic mode so

175
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,920
basically all commands by non DBS will

176
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,800
end up like that and you also get this

177
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,730
buzzer inside your error lock you get a

178
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,990
warning saying okay somebody's accessing

179
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,290
the honeypot time to act

180
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,660
that is the connection ID here which

181
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,699
should give you an idea of which

182
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,829
connection this came from of course this

183
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,750
is just for demonstration purposes you

184
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,639
can print all kinds of information there

185
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,800
it's available just wanted to be shot

186
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,099
right so that's our buzzer kick in Kenya

187
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,910
okay so now you you're going as the BA

188
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,130
you assess the damage you understand

189
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,740
what was done you eventually have all

190
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,410
the clocks turned on so you have a full

191
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,259
record of what happened and after you

192
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,240
are done with all these activities you

193
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,870
want to prime your honeypot again so

194
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,360
what you do is you reset the the panic

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
mode and you are a DBA here as root

196
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,839
local host so you can do that and then

197
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,899
after that the system enters like the

198
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,180
initial state and it's ready to catch

199
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:59,490
some more well twice alright that's all

200
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,970
of my talk really I hope you enjoyed it

201
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,680
if you have questions please go ahead

202
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,180
sir

203
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,420
okay so the question is whether the

204
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,249
panic mode is global for the server or

205
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:23,839
for this session only right so right now

206
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,540
the way this plugin is created it is

207
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,549
global for all the sessions in the

208
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,970
server because the the audit API event

209
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,949
will trial for all the commands by all

210
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:38,269
sessions future and current you can do

211
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,339
it differently you can do it per session

212
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,379
you can do it you know otherwise it's

213
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,569
all there but you need to put some more

214
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,290
work

215
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,220
yes yes okay so the question is the

216
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,980
following whether the tripwire is

217
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,589
visible if you do show globals and is it

218
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,800
possible to hide it yes it is visible

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,220
because it has two system variables

220
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,310
that's how you will see it if you want

221
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,100
to hide that then you just need to

222
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,620
configure your tripwire in a different

223
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,080
way not to system variables like well

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,790
read the configuration file or whatever

225
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,839
questions no okay we'll finish early

226
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,290
them great thank you

227
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,839
[Applause]
