1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,440
go ahead all right how do people this is

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,840
kubernetes Singh cluster FS finally

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,889
plain nice together

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,049
lightning version I'm Jose this is a

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,520
chic let's see what we can do in five

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,369
minutes

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,270
hi so bless profess so mostly everyone

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,789
knows glass surface I think so glycerin

9
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,590
versus a distributed storage software

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,070
different storage file system so it it a

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,378
grits stories from different nodes and

12
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:34,480
gives out us a single volume to the

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,079
customer or the user so how its minimum

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,120
level is breaks and from my device and

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
LV is created and that small part of LV

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:46,899
is a break

17
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,559
we take Elvis from each node mean bricks

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,389
from each node in terms of glycerin face

19
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,760
and create a volume out of it and mount

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,579
it anywhere we have protocol supporting

21
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,359
fuse and NFS and samba so that's what

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,780
glistrup versus in shorter version and

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,370
hecka theha katisa restful interface

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,180
which can manage glossary FS volumes or

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,920
create lists refers volumes for you you

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,450
don't have to go behind the screen and

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,600
create the lv SVG's and manage your

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,649
disks so Hecate will take care of it and

29
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,030
jose is going to continue on the cool

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,770
part cool part i say alright so these

31
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,719
days closed surface and hikari are fully

32
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,090
hyper-converged with kubernetes that

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,680
just means that they're running as

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,560
containers in a kubernetes cluster

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,909
serving storage for other for other

36
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,060
kubernetes applications obviously with

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,799
hyperconvergence this means that you

38
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,450
guys can save money in your data centers

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,189
by not having to buy separate storage

40
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,140
appliances just buy a couple SSDs or

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,060
something

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,670
these the applications have applications

43
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,799
in kubernetes have native access to

44
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,659
storage from kubernetes which means that

45
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,549
it's you know a little less network

46
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,819
latency and it's less prone to and it's

47
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,319
less prone to outages from the network

48
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,929
because if your if your apps can't

49
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,390
access your storage that means your that

50
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,619
means your kubernetes cluster is down

51
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,830
and you have other problems and the

52
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,260
glossary first node can don't need to

53
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,060
run on every node all the time

54
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,370
they only need to run the nodes

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,110
actually have storage on them so you can

56
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,450
actually have nodes that aren't there

57
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,739
aren't come that are not completely

58
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,159
alike and the gloss the glossary FS

59
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,900
Damon set will take care of making sure

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,519
they're running in the right place and

61
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,569
we kept the ability to easily scale out

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,340
that is given that is that is brought

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,860
with glossary FS here's a little picture

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
of how things are supposed to look

65
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,180
you'll see that Hetty is running it's a

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,099
single pod on one of the nodes it

67
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,230
doesn't matter which note it's on and

68
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,790
the three nodes I have storage attached

69
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,160
to them have Gluster FS pods running in

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,810
them that are all logically linked

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,900
together into one cluster FS cluster and

72
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,519
as I'm as you can see there they don't

73
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,519
have to have the same topology of disks

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,799
on every node we just need to know what

75
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,900
the topology is so that we can serve it

76
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,569
to the group of kubernetes applications

77
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,239
and we also we also allow for dynamic

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,620
provisioning if you're familiar with

79
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,150
that in Kerber Nettie's the

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,700
administrator on the right there

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,700
provides a starch class which defines

82
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,230
that applications can use some

83
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,130
underlying storage and the admin manages

84
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,400
that by saying an endpoint that tells it

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,650
where to get access to the glossary FS

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,919
pods and a rest URL that points to the

87
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,109
heck Hettie rest interface and after

88
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,609
that the user on the left there only

89
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,620
needs to know the name of the storage

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,620
class in this case cluster and when you

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,690
create your persistent volume claim over

92
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,669
on the left there it gets attached to

93
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,690
the starch class and when and then

94
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,060
creates a persistent volume in some

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,620
storage somewhere in this case it create

96
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,500
that Nemec li creates a cluster volume

97
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,449
on your on your Gluster storage and that

98
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,120
then gets attached to the PVC and can be

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,519
used by an applicator and that that is

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,290
now a persistent volume that can get

101
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,480
attached to a PVC and used by a

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,829
kubernetes application from the user and

103
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,519
unfortunately at this point there would

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,349
be a demo but the demo video itself is

105
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,730
about four minutes long which is about

106
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,250
as long as its presentation so thank you

107
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,149
very much

108
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,430
he's a sheik i'm jose here's a couple of

109
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,919
links these slides will be online after

110
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,419
this presentation and hopefully the

111
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,430
video - we'll see thank you

112
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,860
[Applause]
