1
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,070
have good morning everyone thank you for

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,360
being here and thank you for the awesome

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,219
team to organize all of this very nice

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,980
event really happy to be here to talk to

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,130
you about Scotties which is a software

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,560
we just released it's a it's a web

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,570
applications to simply create thematic

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,320
maps in three steps actually at all we

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,240
designed for students I'll tell more

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,800
about this I am Paula

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,220
I am from Media Lab research lab in in

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,699
Paris from sha spoke and I'm here

13
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,010
presenting work that actually some

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,830
colleagues worked more than me on bahama

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,690
and otherwise we couldn't come today so

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,080
I just ripple represent them our lab is

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,970
social sciences research lab in which we

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,059
actually try to design what we call

19
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,409
digital research methods which means

20
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,299
that we are trying to give researchers

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,309
in social sciences new ways to do with

22
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,320
touch through the means of different

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,740
digital tools and then because we're

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,539
doing that and because we do science and

25
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:09,950
we believe into the open science

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,380
everything we do are free and open

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,020
source software you can check out our

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,909
github accounts in which we have many

29
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,049
more products so in these projects we

30
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,350
worked closely with another team from

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,469
South locally the cartography who are

32
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,380
basically cartographers who are really

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,329
specialists into graphics technology so

34
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,460
they also are doing information

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,009
visualizations not only maps or

36
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,079
geographical maps but also data

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,560
visualizations and they are doing that

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,170
for teaching to support teaching

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,810
activities research activities editions

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,850
of books or even for some museums you

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,369
can follow those guys you know the names

42
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,679
you should click on the icon on what

43
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,009
well actually my slides are online in in

44
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:08,110
this URL and yeah so Tim attic maps are

45
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,360
maps which looks like that it's

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
basically the kind of mats you you might

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
have stumble upon during your teaching

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
periods when you

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,430
you open a geographical history my book

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,010
you will find this kind of maps so in

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,450
this map for instance it represent the

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,150
world's carbon dioxide emissions in 2013

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,340
with two different visual forms first

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,250
one is the color of the area the country

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,320
is representing the per habitants

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,580
emissions where this cycle forms

57
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,990
represent the total amounts of emissions

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,450
if you want to see more of their work

59
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,040
from a TV cartography they have a carto

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,450
tech which is website while they

61
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,760
actively publish all their predictions

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,730
online on a Creative Commons license so

63
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,150
you can find more than that okay so the

64
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,100
story starts when actually this guy's

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,080
from Attila cartography one a grounds

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,390
from our university organizations to

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,450
design and block pelagic pick a

68
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,600
pedagogical mapping tool so the whole

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,270
idea here wants to provide students with

70
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,959
the tool to do this kind of somatic maps

71
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,250
so we started a tripartite

72
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,170
collaborations where we have teaching

73
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,150
cartographers so they are at the same

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,850
time we're doing cultural cartography

75
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,400
and maps at a high level of similar G

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,700
and also teachers we were more likely

77
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,270
the digital message specialists and also

78
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,730
people used to drive free and open

79
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,890
source software projects on agile

80
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,980
methods with the agile methods as as I

81
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,670
mean and and then we I hired a guy

82
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,890
called Alan a pizzelle from company

83
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,959
called epics with a web application

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,870
developer specialized into cartography

85
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,200
for capture graphical tool so I have to

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,170
to really say thank you and Bravo to all

87
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,780
know who actually did all the hard work

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,070
of cutting everything you're going to

89
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,250
see here and it really made a really

90
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,959
great job so if you need a good

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,000
developer in this area you could show it

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,060
check his website

93
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,760
so our first objective is to make things

94
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,040
easily as easily as possible

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,350
so we want our tool to be accessible for

96
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,410
newbies when I say that like more likely

97
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,249
a second like license to

98
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,739
students two years after bacala high in

99
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:37,189
France we want to create a map of course

100
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,079
for that we make what to make sure to

101
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,449
have mean to get the data for and for

102
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,369
the map due to upload data and then I

103
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,099
want to be able to choose with map

104
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,039
projection we're going to use and we

105
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,719
want this map to convey a message

106
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,359
so we invest a lot into means to

107
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,379
actually choose in tune visual forms to

108
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:03,499
map the data on on the picture so to sum

109
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,839
up we are basically three steps in this

110
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,479
tool i we are going to show it after

111
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,669
that point first one is to upload data

112
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,319
of course then to choose map position

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,360
and finally to a digital forms in the

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,099
uploading data step what we the features

115
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,959
we've developed are that data type

116
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,419
recognition so you just input CSV and

117
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,889
then try to understand where that

118
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,019
numbers columns or latitude and

119
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,089
longitude column geography names columns

120
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,809
or any kind of simple qualitative values

121
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,569
like strings and we also the tool

122
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,179
propose geographical names alignments so

123
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,969
we are trying to recognize from the

124
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:42,769
column with geographic names which one

125
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:46,639
we have in our base map then we ask the

126
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,879
user to choose map projection and two so

127
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,369
we really want this tool to convey

128
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,429
pedagogical also information that's why

129
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,699
we tried model cartographers to post

130
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,049
three different pitches to to guide the

131
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,879
user through the choice of my prediction

132
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,069
the first one area so those are

133
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,219
projections respect the areas the second

134
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,139
one is distance and San Juan is angles

135
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,049
so they actually this is all the map

136
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,909
projection with the tool proposed so far

137
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,839
so we have what you know that I'm sure

138
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,119
and tell what they did back to his a

139
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,299
decided to qualitatively decide which

140
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,059
one we're the good ones to do if you

141
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,639
want to respect the area's or as a

142
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,489
distance are the angle and then it leads

143
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:38,449
to people just to to remember that the

144
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,639
market are protections which is most

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,069
commonly used because it's squared it's

146
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,930
it's quite convenient

147
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,030
it'll be good for angle but pretty bad

148
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,259
for distance in areas that's really one

149
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,020
important point for my colleagues from

150
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,780
material category but you can still use

151
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,470
it if you want and the last step is to

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,229
tune the visual forms so here basically

153
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,120
the idea is first to pick a variables

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,229
from this data you can have many

155
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,729
different columns in your CSV you pick

156
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,770
one and you say like well what I want to

157
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,090
do with that I want to add the symbols

158
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,360
on my map I want to draw colors on areas

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,820
and then you can tune the color the size

160
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,740
you can define classes you'll see that

161
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,830
how to to map the variations in two

162
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,460
different classes using means and all

163
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,400
other kind of statistical treatments and

164
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,010
then finally you have your map you add

165
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,470
the title and author you add source you

166
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,510
change the legend and here you are yeah

167
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:42,250
just see SVG sorry are yo PNG alright so

168
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,639
remember that map the one they've done a

169
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,320
picked up as an example so what we are

170
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,770
going to do now is to do live mapping

171
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,280
exercise so I find the datasets they've

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,410
used to do the first one so this map has

173
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,270
been done basically in Illustrator I

174
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,880
think I should have asked my colleagues

175
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,840
about that but I think it's mainly

176
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,880
illustrator so now we are going to do it

177
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,620
with risk artists using the same data

178
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,360
and here we are okay so this is the data

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,080
sets so it's basically total total

180
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,110
dioxide emissions we have many years so

181
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,889
I'm just going to filter out thanks to

182
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,580
leave office the year we want to map so

183
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,240
let's go let's take that one ah over

184
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,010
there yeah so I'll just copy and let's

185
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,560
go to Curtis

186
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,800
no-nothing right so here it's got this

187
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,579
the first thing i will do is to change

188
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,910
to English for you guys so the first

189
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,339
thing the tool proposed you is to select

190
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,490
a map so here I'm going to work on the

191
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:11,209
world countries the 2016 time it's it's

192
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,370
its it proposed you'd many different

193
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,769
ways to describe countries so we have

194
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,809
labels in different different languages

195
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:21,199
we also have like easel cuts but you

196
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,059
don't have to worry about this if you

197
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,279
need suss to prepare your data you can

198
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,490
download this model to do your cleaning

199
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,769
so the cleaning can be done has to be

200
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:35,110
done bit preferably before but if you

201
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,980
apply so if you just upload your CSV so

202
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,980
we I have hit here and here you have the

203
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,930
colon recognitions data type row

204
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,699
condition I was talking before and as

205
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,420
you can see what you can see here for

206
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,920
instance and the the year has been

207
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,579
understood as a lot latitude information

208
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,829
it's not it's a it's a numeric one and

209
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,089
then here you can see that it didn't

210
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,529
succeed into casting strings into

211
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:11,629
country names for 24 cases on 220 and

212
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,329
then here we have a little guide to let

213
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,180
the users actually helped the algorithm

214
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,399
while not diagram the alignments process

215
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,649
manually so we try to do everything on

216
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,809
automatic aways and if it's not then

217
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:29,870
well here for instance the a is

218
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,699
calibrated we say in France French is

219
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,160
not recognized the case we want the end

220
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,920
in info letters and this is this is true

221
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,110
for everything it's like almost a key we

222
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,569
are sticking into adding a kind of a

223
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,939
fuzzy recognition mechanism here we have

224
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,620
the technology we just have to put the

225
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,009
button here whether you know we haven't

226
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,589
done that so far so this is important

227
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,569
because like if you don't do that you

228
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,970
will not recognize China mainland as as

229
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,440
China so you will have like missing

230
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,000
points in your in your map and you do

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,760
you don't want that right so this is

232
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,050
yeah so I'll switch to I'll switch to

233
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,380
the point where I've done that okay it's

234
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,740
Yahoo it's done right so mostly I

235
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,360
couldn't find one ferret so it means

236
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,550
that you have more data in my files than

237
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,830
I have on my base map okay I can drop

238
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,470
one I'm fine with that

239
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,590
the rest is pretty cool so we can go

240
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,190
into the visualization and this is where

241
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,410
you close your eyes because I want to do

242
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,850
that with you all right so so I have my

243
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,600
base map here so it's for now empty here

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,090
I can go back to choose different kind

245
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,550
of base map if I want I have to click

246
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,490
here you can also tune the base map if

247
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,690
you need to you know for instance here

248
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,100
you can change the longitudes right and

249
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,060
then this is where the plus button gives

250
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,890
you brings you to the second step which

251
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,440
is basically to create visual forms so

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,510
the first thing as I'm going to do is to

253
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,150
take the total now I'm going to take the

254
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,100
per-capita 3rq emissions and then I'll

255
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,890
use and this is where the tools propose

256
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,410
you to to decide which forms visual

257
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,070
forms oh sorry am i mr. fynch

258
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,160
sorry about that yeah better so here you

259
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,470
can choose different visual forms so you

260
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,810
have two ways the first thing you have

261
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,860
to choose is whether you want to

262
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,339
consider this variables as values or as

263
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,589
categories quantitative value variables

264
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,650
quality variables and then film choices

265
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,020
do you want to use symbols or areas so

266
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,240
here I'm going to use areas continuous

267
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
scale and here we are here we have the

268
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,270
distribution those values and you can

269
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,510
choose different ways to discretize your

270
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,660
your values regular interval distant

271
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,640
means and conceals you can choose the

272
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,150
number of

273
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,000
as you want so just to show you that

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,580
that actually works right you can change

275
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,090
everything

276
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,540
you can also choose the color patterns

277
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,600
so we free compute lot of different

278
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,560
color patterns to provides either so if

279
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,240
I want to do something similar to the

280
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
first one we had I need to use a scale

281
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,520
of red yep I'm good or you can use

282
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,060
hatching if you want remember this time

283
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,450
we were using hatchings you can do it

284
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,430
you can serve it as a scale if you like

285
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,420
it's better right

286
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
you can also see you that I will get it

287
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,620
if you need and here we are we have our

288
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,330
first visual forms which is arias colors

289
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,160
and then I'm going to speed up because

290
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,490
I'm late then I'm adding a new vision

291
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,890
your variable with the total emissions

292
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,710
and now I'm going to use symbols and

293
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,010
then for the symbols I'll actually use

294
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,830
circles and then I will make them empty

295
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,460
no sorry I'm using the Alpha right and

296
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,640
then I'm just using the scale using the

297
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,760
USA as my maximum I think maybe not and

298
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,860
here we are let's say we're good right

299
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:44,250
okay there are so now we have our map

300
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,950
our visual forms we have a legend that's

301
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,940
pretty cool and we just okay I edit the

302
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,940
titles there off the source of data and

303
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,880
the author here you can see that there I

304
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,570
did on the on the on the it on the edge

305
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,820
of the map and then from here you can

306
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,070
decide to put the legend or to discards

307
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,560
to add borders to do or you can put the

308
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,160
criticals back if you need all that kind

309
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,360
of things you can choose a resolution

310
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,550
and then BAM you can download okay

311
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,060
so sorry about that

312
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,470
up here we are okay so we had this is

313
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,870
our results and so in a few minutes I

314
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,580
tried to do the same thing that we had

315
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,860
been your straighter right with goddess

316
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,620
like that I gotta finish up another kind

317
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,880
quite of nice features that actually

318
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,310
took a few times to do from our no to

319
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,040
develop this this kind of base map where

320
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,980
you actually have discontinuity in the

321
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,500
in the geospatial areas so we have the

322
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,280
France metropolitan and then we have

323
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,120
departmental chimera which are like

324
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,850
islands in in a in calories and a little

325
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,640
Avenue and so here I used the OL

326
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
localized benefits and the zero

327
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,390
localizations work some different

328
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,430
different areas although there is

329
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,530
discontinuity between sauce doing that

330
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,040
was not exactly easy because it was not

331
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,510
planned at the beginning the we haven't

332
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,200
thought about that until the all engine

333
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,840
of putting the points on the map I

334
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,570
needed this special me to multiple

335
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,690
geospatial areas under the hood we have

336
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,450
a full web client application in amber D

337
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,990
is the Java scripts we use d3 for for

338
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,070
protection in many different

339
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,420
visualizations utilities you can fold

340
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,670
that on github of course and because

341
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,490
it's full web your data stays on your

342
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,310
computer so we don't have any server

343
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,370
features it's only web full web which

344
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,780
means that we it was quite easy to

345
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,790
provide with an electron version for

346
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,560
offline news which means that you can

347
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,020
also download a desktop application of

348
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,250
cartas and use it on your computer

349
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,950
without internet they'll actually talk

350
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,050
about electron later this day in another

351
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,329
room and that's it

352
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,290
hey Eric artists

353
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,000
[Applause]

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:33,700
any questions okay so another the old

355
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,670
person so your question is what is our

356
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,440
Yolo to reuse data to create a map I

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,260
think for what I know is for first thing

358
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,570
this little set I'm using here was I

359
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,660
think a DIY so it starts really

360
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,490
published it away no problem with that

361
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,370
but I think it's I think a map can be

362
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,299
understood as a statistical read work on

363
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,160
data so you know if you publish the map

364
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,660
without the datasets you're not

365
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,400
publishing the data so you're not need

366
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
right to publish it because you are

367
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,870
polluting your work of interpretation of

368
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:34,480
the data so this is different point yes

369
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,000
okay so two things about that first is

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,490
this tool is is to create thematic map

371
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,460
so your map is not an exploratory data

372
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,490
analysis tool if you want to do that use

373
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,870
a die yes it's good for you you will use

374
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,549
that once you know what you want to tell

375
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,850
your readers and your readers will not

376
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,950
support like too many information in one

377
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,380
map so you have to choose for them how

378
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,490
you're going to to tell your stories

379
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,770
with maps which means that you might

380
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,770
first put like two three five layers of

381
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,290
symbols you can do that in ink artists

382
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,419
actually in the veg civilization here

383
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,160
this is one layer this is another layer

384
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,830
you can you can add many layers if you

385
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,250
need but I mean more than three is going

386
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,770
to be a mess and then you can create

387
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,909
multiple Maps

388
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,470
and then you're going to build an atlas

389
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,049
basically so it's really like um those

390
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,940
are your producing documents people can

391
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,710
read and you have to make sure what you

392
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,629
are doing is going to be easily be

393
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,820
easily readable by the people so you can

394
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,529
not put too much information

395
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,979
yeah

396
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
yeah

397
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,630
okay so um no not yet probably not that

398
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,720
soon because our targeted audience

399
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,030
oh yes the question was can you can you

400
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,870
build your own based map in cartus so

401
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,900
technically you could but we are not

402
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,270
going to put money into the user

403
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,520
interface to do so because our tiding

404
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,070
audience are our students which doesn't

405
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,680
doesn't know how to do that but but I

406
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,590
mean the old system is easily manageable

407
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,440
by our team of cartographers to add base

408
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,810
maps so the process to do that would

409
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,880
contact them pop up the base map they

410
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,340
will tell you the guidelines of which

411
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,380
kind of business maps I can handle and

412
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,440
then put it back in the source code and

413
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,340
you can also focus source code learn how

414
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,950
to do it and do it on your own but there

415
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,330
will not be like user interface to do

416
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,480
that

417
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,150
yeah I think though well I hope but this

418
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,730
is this is a joint collaboration so I'm

419
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,560
speaking on the behalf of my teams of

420
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,570
cartographers I don't know exactly what

421
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,540
their editorial you know directions in

422
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,670
the direction they want to go but I'm

423
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,980
pretty sure they will accept

424
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,810
contributions like noobest nuts yep yep

425
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,860
yeah of course

426
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:27,660
look it's easy so you have two ways to

427
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,690
do it you can do it like this and it

428
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,370
really spot only the viewable part code

429
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,210
components or you can once when you

430
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,940
choose a base map we have base map on

431
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,710
the specific countries as France as I

432
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,270
showed in my slides you might have a

433
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,139
base map for Asia

434
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,750
okay thank you

435
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,259
[Applause]
