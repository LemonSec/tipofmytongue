1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:11,070
okay I can talk any louder hello and I'm

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,780
going to talk about the communication

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,810
protocol called Modbus who knows what

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,279
batches okay so I will start with that

5
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,120
they need is the joy to understand the

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,620
binary language of moisture vaporators

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:11,670
okay as you understand the galaxy depend

8
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,509
on choosing the right protocol for your

9
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,130
instrument so I'm going to talk about a

10
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,530
protocol called the mode life which is a

11
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,009
very simple mode protocol but it's very

12
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:36,710
good for small devices it is simple and

13
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,970
who I am my name is Jakob I'm a software

14
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,390
engineer at reddit and basically what I

15
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,160
do is dazzle metrics from the cloud

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,530
cloud you know what the cloud is cloud

17
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,140
is a lot of computers and it's not very

18
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,850
visible and I collect matrix form and I

19
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,479
used to work in a company that

20
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,759
manufactures measurement equipment that

21
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,179
measured real-life things it measured

22
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,180
electricity - measured heat

23
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,200
and when I started measuring the clouds

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,890
I saw very cute

25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,150
free software for measuring metrics and

26
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,439
I said we have to do it for real things

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,129
so we ended up in very nice and very

28
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,469
robust dashboard for the Internet of

29
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,379
Things and I'm going to talk about these

30
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,790
tools okay I have to they're paying for

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,030
me to come here so manager Q I work for

32
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,599
a free software called manager Q we are

33
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,469
on github we even have a booth Phil ok

34
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:06,799
so any just look at the time okay

35
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,159
gathering metrics will need it will need

36
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,090
these three parts to work it needs a

37
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,150
collector which is the software that

38
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,510
collects the metrics and put it into it

39
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,870
that that's a better base we need a data

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,229
base and we need some program that will

41
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,199
show us the data that we collect and

42
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,079
when we start working with clouds we

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,109
have a lot of data so in a regular

44
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,669
database we will start not working so

45
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,889
well and we need to replicate and use

46
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,859
more no no don't compute nodes for data

47
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,530
and that's why we are not using a

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,859
traditional data data database we'll use

49
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,509
something like ocula which is a database

50
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:09,190
that can replicate on many nodes

51
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,550
and I think it's time for the demo yes

52
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,600
okay so the demo this is the good part

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,830
so what we are doing I have to find my

54
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,790
web browser it doesn't work okay I will

55
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,660
start it and what we see here is nothing

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,990
I will go to the power metals which work

57
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,200
now I started it when we started with

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,350
the last talk so we have half an hour of

59
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,050
data and what we see here is a dashboard

60
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,980
it is it called gopanna it is well

61
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,060
tested many people love it and its

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,190
really used very much in cloud making so

63
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,700
we know it works it's very cute to work

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,500
with I don't understand the time here

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,810
but I see if we'll have time I'll show

66
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,300
how you play with it it's very very cute

67
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,490
many people love it and the next thing

68
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,550
that I'm going to show is the ocular

69
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,060
database in this demo I didn't really

70
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,480
use how cool I used and more Cocula

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,970
which we use for testing because a real

72
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,450
hope you love doesn't play well with one

73
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,500
laptop it needs the cloud to work well

74
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,590
so what you see here have a restful api

75
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,360
of ocula and data is getting pushed the

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,200
database is getting pushed is what you

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,500
see here this is the collector and it

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,940
collects electro electric measurement

79
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,630
from a real device that somewhere on the

80
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,900
internet and people pay electricity by

81
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,410
this value so there in values from a

82
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,729
real real controller some well okay and

83
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,490
now for the very really tricky part I'm

84
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,130
going to show that these protocols the

85
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,890
modest protocol is very robust and it

86
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,640
works from the box so if some of you

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,190
will see worship Satan or something it's

88
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,300
now time to the I'm going to try to make

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,110
it work out of the box and anyone who

90
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,990
ever tried these things will know that

91
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,510
it's not easy okay silence in the

92
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,260
audience okay

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,400
I prepared a thing that doesn't look

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,229
that it going to work so this is an ESP

95
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,780
now you know I hope that most of the

96
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,629
audience know what it is and it doesn't

97
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,750
I didn't connect it well so okay I

98
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,909
wanted to make this demonstration using

99
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:28,629
the Wi-Fi but I got told that Wi-Fi

100
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,400
doesn't work you so good so I last night

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,750
set and reco Graeme to work on Syria the

102
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,259
notice protocol is very nice on this

103
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,939
first it's simple so it was simple to

104
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,560
convert it to working on serial line and

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,189
the next thing is it has dialects

106
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,460
so there's dialect for talking over wife

107
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,879
either the dialect of talking over Syria

108
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,099
lines for this piece okay and now I'm

109
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,080
going to start it and maybe it work

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,240
married not if you can work it in real

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,719
very nice

112
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:28,389
and we'll start okay so what we see here

113
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,240
is the temperature off ascent or hold it

114
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,020
okay so it will get a hotel I hope it is

115
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,320
not a zombie or something and you see

116
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,690
it's getting hotter what we know is that

117
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,890
our collector that use Modbus works out

118
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:55,660
of the box in this very flimsy setup now

119
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,500
we have the collector and as I showed

120
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,020
you before we have the database and this

121
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,529
database is restful use restful api to

122
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,070
get data into it and get that out of it

123
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,170
and what we see here is getting data in

124
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,020
this code is getting data in and we'll

125
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,680
get this out getting that out into our

126
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,880
dashboard now when I go into tempo and

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,630
humidity will get data and if use

128
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,860
someone is a zombie in the audience okay

129
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:46,180
we just make it it will okay so we saw

130
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,480
the collectors we saw the database and

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,089
we saw the visualizer and the the main

132
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,900
theme of this is there will be talks

133
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,280
about Message Queuing and really fancied

134
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,490
protocols to talk between devices but

135
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,030
the old protocol Modbus was invented 30

136
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,170
years ago and many devices today use it

137
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,140
as I showed you the parameter that I

138
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,089
showed you is the real power matter

139
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,570
people use it people pay by what it says

140
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,250
and this is a good protocol hold

141
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,310
a message queuing has its place the

142
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,220
fancy protocols has its place but all

143
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,210
protocols also has their places and we

144
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:49,510
get a really nice dashboard okay and I

145
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,920
have to find the presentation okay and

146
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,510
the next thing so what we so here is a

147
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,970
very old protocol that works and it

148
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,800
works well and it comes from a world of

149
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,120
industrial controllers where people are

150
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,610
very conservative that's why they still

151
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,860
use something for thirty years ago okay

152
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,150
so using this model we used nodejs

153
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,340
client of mobile but they are Python

154
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,380
client of Modbus Java clients of Modbus

155
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,690
every language you notice is very

156
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,170
popular and so how you install this

157
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,740
client of mobile to get working so

158
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,010
anyone knows NPN so all you do is npm

159
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,860
install mobile client and it installed

160
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,900
them on the plant and you can start

161
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,839
collecting data from the device that

162
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,650
knows Modbus a lot of devices node know

163
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,070
Modbus because it's free it's not a free

164
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,430
protocol but it's a protocol published

165
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,160
and everyone can use it any cheap and it

166
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,540
doesn't use CP CPU and memory so a lot

167
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,990
of device you use it

168
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,230
you need a database so you can install a

169
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,110
client for a database this is a client

170
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,880
for ocular as I said I didn't use

171
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,470
regular database because I wanted to

172
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,780
scale in when you're talking about

173
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,990
internet we have a lot of clients and we

174
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,050
don't want something that on our

175
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,230
thousand client will start slowing down

176
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,970
we want something that can replicate

177
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,700
itself on the Internet for this demo I

178
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
didn't use something that can replicate

179
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,720
I use SQLite SQLite doesn't to replicate

180
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,670
well but it's a good database and what I

181
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,610
did was read SQLite in the restful api

182
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,360
Chocula so all my system thinks that it

183
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,790
talks to ocula but it talks to ask you

184
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,120
right and as you seen it works well and

185
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,690
this is all that it takes to get this

186
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,930
dashboard working so it's like you'd

187
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,950
what you see here is a hobby device and

188
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,500
SP and it talks Modbus you have the code

189
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,650
to make it talk Modbus over here

190
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,310
and third Modbus is really used heavily

191
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,640
in devices so you can meet a lot of

192
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,840
devices that actually speak Modbus many

193
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,360
devices speak Modbus and you you

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,340
wouldn't know it because the

195
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,570
manufacturer taught it to talk Modbus

196
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,180
but it that in the brochure it's not

197
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:23,320
sexy to say I'm talking about bus okay

198
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,840
the red one is how much I left all the

199
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,550
runs right it's very confusing

200
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,590
what we have is how the code in this

201
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,610
device works notice is very simple

202
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,760
protocol it's simply dumped memory of

203
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,280
your device and let you write into the

204
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,800
memory of the device which is very

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,490
dangerous so you don't really let people

206
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,330
write into the memory of your device you

207
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,630
make a setter and getter and when the

208
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,270
protocol said write into this memory

209
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,770
location this data you and then you

210
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,460
write what you want or if for example

211
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,000
you decide that if you write to this

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,690
memory location

213
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,630
the device will erase its arms it will

214
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,930
do so it's not have to be writing into

215
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,970
the memory and what we have here is the

216
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,780
device in what what function will run

217
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,910
when some mobis device the command is

218
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,509
called

219
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:45,029
the collectors okay so as I said to get

220
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,669
the system that collects metrics and

221
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,389
show it we need three components one is

222
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,669
the collector one is the database and

223
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:58,439
one is the viewer and here are examples

224
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:06,269
of collectors I think I have the code

225
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,379
next okay so you can hide the collector

226
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,049
in any language you want but for this

227
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,199
demo I choose bash because issued

228
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,029
candidate in bash you can do it anywhere

229
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:23,850
it's it's what we have here is a command

230
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,169
for the bash client it usually demand a

231
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:32,489
password and it usually use secure not

232
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:36,839
HTTP but HPS but as I said I'm using

233
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,089
SQLite and not a real ocula the next

234
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,829
thing is the mobile client and you can

235
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:51,869
read either from TCP or from serial

236
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:59,239
device and a timeout command because

237
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,369
things can happen

238
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:06,589
same thing happens so we need a timeout

239
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,599
not to crush our collector because our

240
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,269
collector needs to one it needs to one

241
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:18,240
whatever happens so we have fail-safes

242
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,000
on our command and then we simply

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,230
collect the data and send it into our

244
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:32,399
database data so basically you can use a

245
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,710
simple database any database you can

246
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,159
write to file but if you want to really

247
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:40,769
do it on web scale you need a database

248
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,340
that can replicate itself there's a lot

249
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,850
of them but I use ocula because that's

250
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,250
what I use for collecting metrics from

251
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,639
the cloud

252
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,080
okay getting Cocula running is not easy

253
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,480
it's depending on the on your web so for

254
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,490
this demo I didn't use real ocula I use

255
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,320
a mock-up we use it for testing it's not

256
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,350
designed to work all all the things that

257
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,010
I shown in her house they can work this

258
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,470
is the only part that is a testing

259
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,710
software but it works and SQLite is not

260
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:32,550
as bad as people say okay thank fun it's

261
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,240
very cute way to visualize things and

262
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,500
you saw it and we come to questions okay

263
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,520
such question is what is this this is a

264
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,000
water vapor water and it sticks batching

265
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,920
[Applause]
