1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,020
hi everyone my name is solovar Canova

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,289
I'm from stick things at five or from

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,930
the Netherlands I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,820
architecture food digitization and

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,120
design and just to figure out which

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,260
button does what short introduction

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,309
about myself pretty broad backgrounds

9
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,260
I've been working in ICT for about 20

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,199
years for last 10 years self-employed

11
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:42,719
entrepreneur and spoke last year will

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,789
force them about integrating spell

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,670
checking and grammar checking and this

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,260
year speaking about a project we did at

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,170
six teams at five to talk about full

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,510
design and some of these other projects

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,629
by the way you can find on my github

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,969
account there's a lot of loads of stuff

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,670
a pretty wide interesting many different

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,100
things and so I ended up in full design

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,229
projects which I okay so I ended up in a

22
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,969
full design project which I never

23
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,909
thought I would end up in and I'm going

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,009
to talk about today is a small study we

25
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,659
did on a very old phones but we got the

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,259
money for it how we went around running

27
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,539
the projects and what kind of open

28
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,909
source design tools we used in order to

29
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,409
create this font and we're from the city

30
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,049
of Delft in the Netherlands and we have

31
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,350
a total post office which is about 100

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,740
years old and they decommission it about

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,799
three years ago but it's a public

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,469
building and it's a monument state

35
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,780
monuments and it has been an inspiration

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,299
for a long time for me personally and

37
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,659
other people who might know it might

38
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,020
know it okay it's a plea of warming

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,830
atmosphere if you're inside the initial

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,370
designs are from the 20s and well it's

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,720
it's a it's a moment

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,100
but it's full of all sort of detailed

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,920
decorations amongst which the most

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,830
important ones are a number of statues

45
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,300
in the main hall and these are five of

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,160
the six statues which have letters on

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,630
them and over the years are sort of got

48
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,480
the idea of well might be nice to

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,010
digitize these letters and create a fold

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,720
out of it

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,700
but I have many of these small ideas and

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,320
then you know and it just another hobby

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,650
project so why don't we country transfer

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,420
this into a more serious project and get

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,070
some funding to do it and do it properly

56
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,180
and I'm in a world of you ever design a

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:12,030
font okay so from designer as many

58
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,890
friends of mine noticed when I talked

59
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,140
about them in the first stage of

60
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,690
displays like I you just drove drove the

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,400
lines and that's it and then you're done

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,420
but it's a bit more tricky than that

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,930
especially well go to that lead later so

64
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:39,720
I asked if that part yeah okay let me

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,250
back on tone the the sculpture by the

66
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,290
way before I go into the design of the

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,180
font the guy was the the third most

68
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,220
influential sculpture in the Netherlands

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,670
for sculptures which are commissioned by

70
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,200
buildings that were built by the state

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,320
and you can find uh some of his work on

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,930
the internet and we didn't know much

73
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,720
about buildings sorry sculptures for

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,760
buildings but back in the 20s and the

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,330
30s was a big thing and especially in

76
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,310
the style he worked in the unconscious

77
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,060
hole there's a many buildings in the

78
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,918
Netherlands which have not just fixed

79
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,530
but also many decorative elements many

80
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,970
statues then

81
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,160
this is a font about a hundred years old

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,410
and we're walking around in Brussels the

83
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,500
other day so we thought like maybe there

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,310
are some references of going there usage

85
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,320
of such a form that you saw on the

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,110
statues and there plenty of examples you

87
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,490
still find of this really thick

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,820
hundred-year-old

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,900
font design so even though it's old it's

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,000
still relevant usable if you like

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,140
something in this style then to go into

92
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,890
your the characters a bit more so if

93
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,390
you're standing there whole and you look

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,250
up to these statues this is what you

95
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,930
actually see and if you try to draw over

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,180
this in order to make a letter out of

97
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,190
this is quite tricky you see the

98
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,390
distortion and then many more aspects

99
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,130
which make it not so easy to digitize

100
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,450
this font suggests the edges are pretty

101
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,900
rough

102
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,520
they look smooth maybe if you make a

103
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,810
detailed photograph it's pretty messy

104
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,790
the letters are adjusted for height as

105
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,880
you can see here the eye is sort of

106
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
pushed together in order to fit the

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,030
whole world Australia the proportions

108
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,940
are also changed from statute to statue

109
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,120
so this little bar here from the e is in

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,220
some statues a bit higher and the other

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,850
one's a bit lower some details differ

112
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,480
and for example the K the indentation on

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,460
top sometimes has a little bit different

114
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,500
shape it's black on black so if you want

115
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,480
to do edge detection on this it's an

116
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,560
extra challenge what else there's a

117
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,330
whole list of stuff which doesn't make

118
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,930
this easy the original designs were made

119
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,130
on the gypsum and there were even as

120
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,530
maybe sometimes less accurate as the

121
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,960
final result so even if you have access

122
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
to the design it doesn't make it that

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,410
much easier so we went there with my

124
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,650
colleague who and took some pictures of

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,410
this which was not easy especially you

126
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,249
have to get to her elevated

127
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,409
position to make the photographs and

128
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,359
even then if you zoom in in the

129
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,219
photographs you'll see that at the end

130
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,419
of the picture already you're looking up

131
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,129
like if you're standing down and you get

132
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:59,819
some distortions in the properties so

133
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,989
that's the whole list actually so to get

134
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,389
more acquainted with these letters I

135
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,349
made some models of them which was a fun

136
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,389
project to get away from the computer

137
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,149
once in a while and you get a bit of a

138
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,739
feeling and it's not only for yourself

139
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,719
as a study but if you want to do such a

140
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,519
project in a more serious way and we've

141
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,860
got some funding it's very good to take

142
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,509
that to the people you're talking to and

143
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,189
put it on the table and they can feel it

144
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,589
and then it speaks a bit more than just

145
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,069
a photograph of some letters so there

146
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,979
was sort of a side effect which was very

147
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:42,579
helpful now I need to get access to the

148
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,319
designs that were made by the sculpture

149
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,339
which is already dead since and before

150
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,779
the Second World War

151
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,429
I requested access to a Depot of a

152
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:58,029
museum and it took about five months to

153
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,949
get the access and it's a pretty heavy

154
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,019
guarded place and in there they search

155
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,209
for all the designs they had from this

156
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,249
guy and they put them on display for me

157
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,009
so I could study them and look at them

158
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,979
how he made those statues and other

159
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,059
works and that was what became very

160
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,969
clear pretty off pretty quickly what's

161
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:22,619
that

162
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:27,339
as you can see here many is that the

163
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,909
side of the characters are not on a 90

164
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:31,599
degree angle

165
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,839
they're on the bigger angle so if you

166
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,269
have a statue in order to make it easier

167
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,169
to look at the sort of a beveled side to

168
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,839
it which doesn't make it easier if

169
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,490
you're gonna digitize it because some

170
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,860
details are smoothly going from the

171
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,769
front surface to the back and makes a

172
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:51,750
challenge even

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,240
bigger but they are very nice

174
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,880
designs this one is from a building in

175
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,970
Amsterdam it's a lobster and it's about

176
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,640
this big so they pulled out all these

177
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,370
chips and models for me to look at for

178
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,310
about two or three hours I the biggest

179
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,420
fun with them get some my sketches this

180
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,240
is also in the same post office made in

181
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,500
that tiles about three meters high and

182
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,470
some sketches those were most

183
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,400
interesting and to me as here you could

184
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,780
see in how we created the counters any

185
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,480
sketches with also in his statues and

186
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,130
I've had me a lot in the digitization

187
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,430
process and the design process because

188
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,230
these statues only had 13 different

189
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,720
characters and for the alphabet you need

190
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,180
26 you know and then you're still not

191
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,280
there if you wanna make a fence for a

192
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,370
wide range of applications so for some

193
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,770
letters like from an e to an F in this

194
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,960
kind of phone is pretty easy but some

195
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
characters you have no idea how to get

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,650
started so little get us all the

197
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,900
sketches and stuff in give me some ideas

198
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,790
on how to construct these missing

199
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,680
letters so but then you have the idea

200
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,650
like okay alright 26 letters where is

201
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,370
the where do we stop we can make shop s

202
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,720
or we can make I J ligature which is

203
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,150
also used in Dutch and you can make

204
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,690
numerals so I sort of made a long list

205
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,480
of about 400 different characters or

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,770
glyphs which I would like to design and

207
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,130
if you sort of group them together and

208
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,810
Jordan dependencies or like for example

209
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,060
if you have an e already and you want to

210
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,850
go to an F then it is a pretty easy step

211
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,540
and this is sort of the whole bridge

212
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,060
made in in one overview all the black

213
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,040
things

214
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,040
see these are the characters which were

215
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,850
on the statues

216
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,050
and if you want to start working with

217
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,180
this then it's like a bit tough so a

218
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,129
sort of gluteus together in a simple

219
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,139
text file and a prior to our prioritized

220
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,899
my design so for example the F could be

221
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,569
derived from the e the AI from the T etc

222
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,670
etc sometimes from multiple letters and

223
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,529
of course it's first down so you're

224
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,800
gonna see code I process the TSV file

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,709
through peiter and with groceries I made

226
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,980
some PNG files of prioritized

227
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,430
dependencies of glyphs in order for the

228
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,829
design of these fonts and then we became

229
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,360
much more clear much more clear and how

230
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,459
I would go about designing this font and

231
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,600
also talking to people who were

232
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,629
interesting interested in financing this

233
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,769
project this would be more practical if

234
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,300
you say well if you give us this mind

235
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,759
this much amount of money we can do this

236
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,990
work well maybe if you give a bit more

237
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,430
we can design numerals and if you have

238
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,439
minerals we don't have only 10 extra

239
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,540
glyphs we have a whole bunch of stuff

240
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,740
like superscript subscript so we change

241
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,600
this whole force of glyphs and into ten

242
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,089
different work packages every we're

243
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,069
about to see if we could find following

244
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:42,740
for this so how do you find funding in

245
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,250
these times

246
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,980
anyone crowdfunding

247
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,140
so we made a little video about this

248
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,620
post office and the statues and II the

249
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,740
idea we had we said the target of five

250
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,890
hundred two hundred years we came up

251
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,960
with some ideas some backs which could

252
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,290
print it stamps books people could adopt

253
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,110
a letter and they could choose a

254
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,170
combination eventually we erased five

255
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,310
thousand eight hundred twenty years and

256
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,260
by five hundred hundreds of five people

257
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,800
and it created our city a lot of

258
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
attention in that there was the space

259
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,860
stuff is going to be designated for the

260
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,600
library and some other reuse such so one

261
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,010
of the people were already having a

262
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,570
focus on what's going to happen in this

263
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,560
building so we sort of hit site along

264
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,060
with that and all was sort of national

265
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,250
online newspapers also wrote article

266
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:55,900
about it and from that point we could

267
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,770
also start working on co-funding because

268
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,150
with these five thousand eight hundred

269
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,400
twenty years we could do part of the

270
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,860
four hundred glyphs and forms do more we

271
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,080
want to have more funding and we also

272
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,810
wrote applications to national and local

273
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,340
state funding organizations so there's

274
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,780
so much passion of the stuffing right

275
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,000
and we had a kickoff event during their

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
own b-mail it's an event in netherlands

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,190
and belgium and also in other countries

278
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,400
away and you can bring your beamer to a

279
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,060
specific venue and you can project

280
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,490
whatever you want and we we did is that

281
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,320
we created in an interactive

282
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,750
installation the people could experience

283
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,110
a concept version of this fence there's

284
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,600
a like depends up version pretty crappy

285
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,670
this is a whole story altogether but

286
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,530
people call the go down with a public

287
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,900
transport card and have their future

288
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,820
predicted by one of these statues and it

289
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,700
was projected only will in between the

290
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,020
original statues and its

291
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,150
same time you get a sticker and if you

292
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,970
put it on your clothes with a nice funny

293
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,800
prediction of your hypothetical future

294
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,580
and we'll split a bit we use of course 0

295
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,710
and Q to connect some parts of this

296
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,690
installation this is older order

297
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,430
technology we use in that so finally

298
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,250
after the crowdfunding we started with

299
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,130
the digitization process you will see a

300
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,910
character black on black rough edges we

301
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,890
made a pipeline we'll make it like a

302
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,240
light and for the colors is an edge

303
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,970
detection and you can do that with this

304
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:57,190
simple line imagemagick then from this

305
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,140
we studied in Inkscape designing

306
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:05,160
characters and after designing a much

307
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,380
big load of characters we wanted to

308
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,260
import these into front forge and not

309
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,170
manually but with the script of course I

310
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,960
just lost piece of code for today in

311
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,810
this talk like the other far away

312
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,420
earlier a new TSV file where we could

313
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,090
import the characters we also construct

314
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,630
characters from an A and D races to get

315
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,600
this one we could horizontally flip

316
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,200
vertically flip glyphs in order to widen

317
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,810
the number of glyph supporters in the

318
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,810
final font so at the moment we have our

319
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,770
hundred and seventy three Clips designed

320
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,670
some are alternative forms we have a

321
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,350
song with an overshoot if you use for

322
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,670
them to typesetting if you have fruit

323
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,070
coaster typesetting you can disable this

324
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,490
and as of today the better version of

325
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,760
this font is available on github the

326
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,209
plans are to also design some minerals

327
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,250
these these are some of the minerals by

328
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,130
the same sculpture they are not in the

329
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,980
same fonts

330
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,470
they gonna work as a idea start starting

331
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,630
points to work on that so with minerals

332
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,850
only not only zero to nine we can do we

333
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,500
can also fractions subscribe

334
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,169
superscripts and this is sort of the

335
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,169
worst list of we were going to add in

336
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:43,070
february the open source design tools

337
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:50,150
were used these usual suspects and these

338
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,919
are the people who made it all possible

339
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,260
and last I want to show you really

340
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,480
quickly how this input process works in

341
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,270
fun Forge who's ever built at fault

342
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:10,270
Forge you are good so you do country dot

343
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,110
you're pasting your Python codes you run

344
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,229
it

345
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,799
oh it's on my screen sorry after quit

346
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:40,249
yeah yeah so Lindo if you see it so just

347
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,649
before when I press this button this got

348
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,769
all filled up real time and all the

349
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:49,159
glyphs got important flips or combined

350
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,379
in order to make this fault exportable

351
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:59,990
to otft TF that's a trap that's the

352
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:10,990
thing with it and it was already

353
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,460
requested to use it in the cover for the

354
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,679
books and they were passing me to get it

355
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,840
finished by first them so I am out on

356
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,389
this afternoon that they can start with

357
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:23,149
it so it will be used in the next couple

358
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:26,049
of months on some books

359
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:59,570
yeah so right we didn't the question so

360
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,140
the question was the difference between

361
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,400
automatically tracing the outlines of

362
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,770
the images and drawing by hand we drew

363
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,470
everything by hands and use the images

364
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,650
as a background to a starting point to

365
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,170
see if it sort of matches up because I

366
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,240
said many of the characters differ in in

367
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,050
size and aspect ratio and we optimized

368
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,000
how the glyphs that we build them up

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,010
because it's a geometric font so you

370
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,810
just play around with circles and

371
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,850
rectangles so always unifying and

372
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,070
minimize so you have the least amount of

373
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,710
notes in this in order to work with and

374
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,200
I spoke to other people also did this

375
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,450
before and they said well if you find an

376
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,570
incomplete form solid years old probably

377
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,130
there's so much variation because it

378
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,960
needs to fit between the ceiling and the

379
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,940
floor so they mess up the letters all

380
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,130
the time just start from scratch and

381
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,980
don't fix yourself on the exact

382
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,920
measurements yes

383
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,750
now it's exactly the same but these are

384
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,010
all references so if we won't want to do

385
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,470
a lower case then we would fill them but

386
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,690
now they're references so that if people

387
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,580
start using it and they're not aware

388
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,320
that's only upper case stands like that

389
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,210
doesn't work so that's why we did it I

390
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,740
got we also gotta fill in for more local

391
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,230
governments about 3,000 euros and my

392
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,000
colleague he went there to defend our

393
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,860
application and he was amazed how well

394
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,870
known for example h skype and open

395
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,429
source was in the local government

396
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:52,140
finance department which was a nice

397
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,500
surprise

398
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,570
for us that we thought we had to fight a

399
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,169
big battle but apparently from all the

400
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:01,710
years of open source endorsement it was

401
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:10,360
pretty easy actually okay thank you

402
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,080
[Applause]
