1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
Oh

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,550
[Applause]

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,320
other guys I was here in fact your

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,660
before talking about how he Salomon's

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,070
our open design some of you might have

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,279
been here but I don't suspect that that

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,599
every one of you have been here last

8
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,430
year so I'm going to give a quick

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,500
overview again of what do we have been

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,050
doing at Madeira at open design at

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,570
buzzer ah why we are not calling it it

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,160
more open source design of missouri's

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,800
because it's too wrong so we just put it

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,380
what do the open design so we're going

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,379
to have a look back at 2016 when you

16
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,789
have been doing what are you have been

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,250
up to and you might have noticed if you

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,579
have come bypassed by the Mozilla booth

19
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,519
we have a new logo and I'm sorry that

20
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,440
I'm after Bella now and belen talked

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,300
about user interaction and I'm talking

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,640
about visual design now so I hope you

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,059
can you can bear with me now so quick

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,910
words about me I may do I'm neurotic

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,210
speaker I go to conferences I talk about

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,290
random stuff that I like like now I'm

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,920
also hackers face sport member overlaps

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,820
which is a one of the elders well we

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,130
only have two active spaces in Albania

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,710
so it's one of them and also our

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,920
community manager foresight point I'm

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,190
also founder of our design which it's a

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,360
company I started like two years ago to

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,220
improve design visual design and well

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,490
user interaction in general with open

36
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,460
source software and help projects have

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,040
better design in general so this helped

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,980
me quite a lot frame a bit of empathy

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,190
with open source which is something I

40
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,170
think that a lot of designers who are

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,640
not working in open source or

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
contributing an open source slack so

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,230
this is a very important aspect I want

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,390
to emphasize in this talk so luckily

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,460
here we understand this is not the case

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,729
but in a lot of other different fields

47
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,038
and environments a lot of people think

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,620
open sources coat so hey I have this

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,720
code like throw it out there and it's

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,810
open source tom

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,640
so that's it it's not that easy and

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,290
there's also many other aspects to open

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,110
source which apply also to design and me

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,890
as not a developer I've always had a

55
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,170
hard time figuring out how I can help

56
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,380
open source projects so when I started

57
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,930
off I thought hey I like design hey I

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,090
like open source but I don't want to be

59
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,709
a jack-of-all-trades doing all these

60
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,260
things together so I try to figure out a

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,000
way how I can combine both of these

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,550
things now believe is very important to

63
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,800
figure out a way how to offer

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,810
non-technical contributors contributor

65
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,580
open source and I think design is one of

66
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,330
the most important aspects to that so

67
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,130
one important aspect like which is the

68
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,069
equivalent of open source or free sample

69
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,290
licenses like the GPL in designer is

70
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,050
Square counts it's something which

71
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,920
really puts a match into all designs we

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,340
create so for example the equivalent of

73
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,580
GPL InDesign is well we can debate about

74
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,100
that but I believe it's good commons

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,019
share-alike attribution attribution

76
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:24,470
share-alike

77
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,130
so this ensures that design is always

78
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,090
shared and licensed under a free well

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,500
open-source Creative Commons license so

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,079
I believe when designers know how to

81
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,790
license the world and how to put it out

82
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,739
in the open they can be better

83
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,630
contributors to open source so having

84
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,870
this Alliance we created a github repo

85
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,720
or Mozilla module open design because

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,310
there were so many people who are asking

87
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,200
me personally hey Ariel can you help

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,359
with that can you create a badge can

89
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,670
create a sticker for me I was like

90
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,030
feeling appreciated but after quite some

91
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,920
time I felt like hey this is not a

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,920
community it's just people asking me or

93
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,950
doing things this is not the spirit of a

94
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,769
community so we tried to create a github

95
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,668
repo on Mozilla we're all designers you

96
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,910
need staff and volunteers would create

97
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,050
would collaborate together and people

98
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,090
for materials from the community would

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,310
ask and request design and we would help

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,789
collaborate together

101
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,279
and this was very helpful actually

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,199
because every design could be tracked

103
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,240
across the board you will know where the

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,490
source files are it would not be a JPEG

105
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,710
image which would be the output

106
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,360
everything will be licensed under

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,610
creative commons attribution/share-alike

108
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,490
license so was very neatly organized in

109
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,139
one place so I'm just going a quick

110
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,960
overview of how this worked out this is

111
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,580
sorry I'm not pronouncing his name there

112
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,589
so this is a guy from India who is

113
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,289
create doing Indian media for the

114
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,180
Missoula community and he needed a

115
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,620
sticker basically so he's basically

116
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,779
giving a brief of what he needs and what

117
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,719
he wants it to look like and it was for

118
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,210
the meetup in 2016 in from there so

119
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,529
obviously the sticker would have

120
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,370
something related with Pinet let me get

121
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,139
a good deadline it was 18 August it was

122
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,909
July so we had quite some time to create

123
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,240
it so it was this guy creating this

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,089
illustration of a fare structure in

125
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,279
there which was one of the symbols of

126
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,539
the city and we ping-pong feedback we

127
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,819
talked about how it might be looking

128
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,830
better in the matura style and how this

129
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,639
would obey the guidelines obey in yeah

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,949
whatever and we came up with this result

131
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,740
after a lot of ping pong and feedback so

132
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,149
this was one of the easier tasks but

133
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,740
this was the way how we would work

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,839
things out after this was put out we

135
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,069
will put all the source files in the

136
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,830
github repo and people could reuse it

137
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,990
even people from outside Mozilla because

138
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,029
it was under Creative Commons license

139
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,639
early one year ago in fact after FOSDEM

140
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,300
2016 module came up with the idea that

141
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,349
guys we need a new brand because there

142
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,629
was something lacking with Mozilla back

143
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,479
then we only had the word mark it wasn't

144
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,279
a proprietary phone by the way if you if

145
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,879
you don't know and it was quite weak if

146
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,309
you look at the other brands for example

147
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,199
this would be Pepsi Facebook or Google

148
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,870
if it would be the star mods or hat like

149
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,530
the grey would work

150
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,760
and we also lacked a proper proper icon

151
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,370
we had the M but we didn't had really a

152
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,330
color or original style to it which

153
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,040
people make which makes people squeal I

154
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,720
you that's Mon Silla so we had some

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,000
discussions and we ask people hey how do

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,340
you recognize materia is it something is

157
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,270
it a fighter

158
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,590
is it the gutsy one is it some someone

159
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,370
who fights for the good we ask people

160
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,050
how they how they seem observer so also

161
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,570
as Balan said before we didn't just go

162
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,160
with visual design that we asked people

163
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,380
how how they percept

164
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,250
the whole experience and also how they

165
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,380
think that there should be and what role

166
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,200
material should have in the world and

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,760
according to that perception of all the

168
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,310
people we started creating the brand

169
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,750
identity and having an idea of where we

170
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,760
should start

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,340
so this was the first face this was done

172
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,430
by an agency who was taking the feedback

173
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,950
from the community and implemented it in

174
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,210
several different ways

175
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,360
and community the community could give

176
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,190
feedback on what they don't like about

177
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,580
each direction and what they don't

178
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,370
actually so I'm not going to details

179
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,010
here it was you can check out the blog

180
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,750
to see all the designs which were

181
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,430
happening it was really messy and

182
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,450
depends on how you look at it it was

183
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,370
also fun because it wasn't supposed to

184
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,520
be clean it was supposed to like give to

185
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,900
show some different directions to the

186
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,560
community so this was the first face a

187
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,510
lot of people commented on a lot of

188
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,919
controversial things of course this

189
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,130
always happens and this was the second

190
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,010
phase then so we had two directions

191
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,150
where the protocol direction which

192
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,250
basically takes inspiration from the

193
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,510
HTTP protocol and this is all for the

194
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,339
final result we went with a protocol

195
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,290
direction and as you can see the new

196
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,500
logo will always be highlighted

197
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
the same as you were doing old on all

198
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,610
computers so the module would mark

199
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,950
cannot stand on its own without the

200
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,760
black box

201
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,930
it also takes inspiration from the

202
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,750
protocol as you can see some people see

203
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,380
the mad face in it like maybe too much

204
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,880
Facebook I don't know but yeah this

205
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
would be the icon as well

206
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,140
it's it does a bit on more personality

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,750
what we have used to have we also have

208
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,940
now different color palettes so we are

209
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,550
going with black and white with the idea

210
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,560
that we have a lot of contracts where

211
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,300
gutsy we have a lot of courage for that

212
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,330
and bunny also have colors so this will

213
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,240
be our new color palette and this offers

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,550
a lot of people to play around with

215
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,820
different elements for their own

216
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,830
communities and the nice thing about

217
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,710
this is that we create a new word we

218
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,920
font if you might have known about arvo

219
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
average an open-source font but it's

220
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,339
very it lacks a lot of characters so we

221
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,310
took our bow and we are implemented we

222
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,500
are changing it quite a lot to our needs

223
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,830
and we are creating 0-0 it's like double

224
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,680
the related fount of our goal which

225
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,300
we're going to put out on an open front

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,820
license in the end of february so this

227
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,730
is not out yet and like everyone can use

228
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,480
arvo and the prompt has such an

229
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,280
implementation that if you write Madeira

230
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,610
it gets translated automatically to a

231
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,980
moss protocol Wow

232
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,920
yeah so is very interesting and the fun

233
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
thing about the injury is is that this

234
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
will be very messy there will be no

235
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,930
guidelines like hey please please obey

236
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,790
the guidelines stuff like that so the

237
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,320
Mozilla works but we always beyond the

238
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,150
black box but everything about that can

239
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,339
be messy as much as people won't

240
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,070
so the idea we had about communities

241
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,140
would be for example if we have module

242
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,080
Belgium we would have an archive of

243
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,470
gifts and imagery which would be put on

244
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,750
on the other side of the logo and this

245
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,680
would be a

246
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440
dynamic experience and just like it

247
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,820
would be messy it will not be

248
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,940
aesthetically pleasing maybe but this is

249
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,850
just the way the web works so we wanted

250
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,970
to implement the chaos and the messiness

251
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,120
of the web also in the brand identity we

252
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,580
didn't want to to be the classic

253
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,470
designers which want to make things look

254
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,140
good we want to translate the idea of

255
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,740
the web into the brand identity so there

256
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,490
are also some some examples of how that

257
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,850
would look like so it's really really

258
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,080
random if you bring a bit of if you had

259
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,670
a bit of experience with Berlin art

260
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,920
style so it's like graffiti you run them

261
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,089
messy it's it's very nice and it's not

262
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,529
really comfortable looking at it I don't

263
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,830
know I don't have a better way for it

264
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,899
but it's it's just like what Zoo is in

265
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,970
the same kind of way we are not a

266
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,380
corporation in the classic sense we are

267
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,790
someone who is like an advocate for the

268
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,310
rap and we wanted also to the been

269
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,779
identity to look like that so this is

270
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,930
also something else like we can play on

271
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,060
with a new banner aunty so I'm going to

272
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,240
show you quickly video of how that would

273
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:35,459
look like in animations sorry there's no

274
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,750
somebody's just running music

275
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,220
okay

276
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,120
I didn't have enough battery

277
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,590
so this would be some examples of the

278
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,260
community to Lois come on

279
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,220
so yeah that's logo in real time and if

280
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,560
you want to get involved into creating

281
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,370
designs or asking even for designs

282
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,720
please feel free to get involved in our

283
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,089
github repo and you can also check out

284
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,010
all this stuff I just showed here and

285
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,839
the design language stop much throughout

286
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
the torque and yeah for anything else

287
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,720
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
