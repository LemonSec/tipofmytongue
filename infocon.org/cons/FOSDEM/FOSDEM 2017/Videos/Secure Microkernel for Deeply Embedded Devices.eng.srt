1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,509
hello everybody my name is Jim Wong I'm

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,570
working in touch to automation in the

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,230
system performs atomization our deeply

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,000
embedded device and his lui

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,830
collaborative let him with me so least

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,630
in this session we are about to discuss

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,000
the construction of secure my corner for

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,210
in bed deeply embedded devices also

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,609
known as I would he you know I hear is

10
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:41,140
just nothing just password you know we

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,960
introduced a new open source imputation

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,819
then after f9 microkernel is is a vision

13
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:53,109
for low-power devices with security

14
00:00:53,109 --> 00:01:01,170
design in mind so America s per se

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,739
security is not a product but a process

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,479
do remember open SSL habits three years

17
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,130
ago is a nightmare and a let's check out

18
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,820
various non firmware attack reacted to

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:28,630
IOT security so the first one is in 2013

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,689
researchers at Georgia presents mccain's

21
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,450
which injects male malware into iOS

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,880
devices by mud modify USB charger and

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,570
another case in internists near the

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,079
researcher and SLA modified firmware or

25
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,490
USB devices which do something evil

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,920
including first two to emulate a

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
keyboard

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,149
and the issue command and behalf of the

29
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,399
login user a second a spoon a network

30
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,540
car and that change it to computers the

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,120
S configuration to read write to the

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,540
traffic

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,920
so you might say how come I'm not so

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,980
stupid but according to the another

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,670
research you know you know the addition

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,030
research user we are pika and a plug in

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,700
USB freshets why absolutely fine find

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,569
usually after the USB oil is kinetic the

39
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,280
evo firmware would be activated this is

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,320
the reason why we should always use you

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,250
should take to secure consideration in

42
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,050
mind last year announced our ability our

43
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,900
angry at M which provides a strong

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,000
extension it can enable past labor

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,700
protection in how we're angry at M core

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,480
can feel the requested DMA SS initial

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,180
initial PI and pretty much cold and past

48
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,070
labor while elites for an ve7m it

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,209
requires most software API MPU which

50
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,370
stands for memory protection uni MBU

51
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,560
banking in v7m reduced the design our

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,230
secure operating system and that secure

53
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,930
OS partition on private MP you with full

54
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,870
control and always keeps privileged more

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,530
for face our queue so why do we need

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,930
another kernel the reason is to

57
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,420
consideration of trusted computing base

58
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,739
every PC P gets more and smaller we can

59
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,160
focus on detailed education and security

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,010
and the further attack so as if wanders

61
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,390
like a bigger kernel began a bigger con

62
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,820
or always suffer from weakness and

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,380
certainty leanness is the best example

64
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,280
to illustrate the quick-release risk

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,600
from so equality the microkernel

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,330
approach as you already know tries to

67
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,770
eliminate the problem arising from big

68
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,780
kernels by strict in following the

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,560
principle of this principle which

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,550
implies nothing allow by default

71
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,860
capability is is a communicable and

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,320
forgettable token of authority it

73
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,450
referred to a value that in refer sorry

74
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,410
it refers to a value that referenced an

75
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,890
object along this social set of

76
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,240
assessments and you use program

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
capability based appearances mass use

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,250
capability to assess an object in other

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,160
word microkernel should be minimal with

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,320
how we enforce separation it's

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,230
interesting that the design competition

82
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,210
between interface first and

83
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,510
implementation first is intervene so you

84
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,680
can see much first is a Marcus Marcus

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,100
ASL is interface first and in the units

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,220
market McConnell and Venus and maybe

87
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,600
it's the last one might be s4 which is

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,270
interface first but the competition is

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:28,150
is there going so the mechanism is

90
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,140
inside McConnell the only trusted

91
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,310
components including aerospace IPC and

92
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,980
the threat management all are the

93
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,330
service account at the use user space

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,050
they're sweet generational micro kernel

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,139
development so the second generation is

96
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:50,909
is

97
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,550
sl4 and as a sir one is SEO for you can

98
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,060
you can forget the first one which is

99
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:06,550
which of the poor performers so let's

100
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,889
start from the second generation the

101
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,889
second generation of Mike O'Connell is

102
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:22,539
known for l 4 and l 4 I mean the

103
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,259
information of air for is a memory it's

104
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,120
known for its is not be fest because of

105
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,060
smaller cash footprint which in price

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,800
much faster IPC L for Israel is not

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,949
exactly an implantation but a memory of

108
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,180
impression as for is most of the other

109
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,419
other waste one licensed under the GNU

110
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,830
GPL elbow is widely commercialized by

111
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,370
kwok-hung and open kernel AB so typical

112
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,270
use case or l4 is to off to over

113
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,289
isolation from somewhere in other cells

114
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,139
so that it retains existing software

115
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,740
components can be reused in new design

116
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,300
furthermore to compare compressive

117
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,250
comparability of dispatching multiple

118
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,050
operating systems work row causing

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,349
multiple physical CPU might be reduced

120
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,360
by means of microkernel based hypervisor

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,149
some migration found generation to the

122
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,990
third generation microkernel is to

123
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,649
result it's a foreign important are in

124
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:50,260
approach in in in improper memory

125
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,350
abstraction which resulting in the

126
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,630
possibility of denial service attack

127
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,640
SEO for is a notable implementation of

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,690
the third-generation microkernel and Eve

129
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,200
night is the new microkernel design

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,769
afford for out here our deeply in debate

131
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:21,680
devices design constituency our first to

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,579
support dynamic nature of IOT devices

133
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:30,019
second is to prevent the relation of the

134
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,380
theta wild traversing to network the

135
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,230
third is advanced power management

136
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,490
another requirement is over-the-air

137
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,120
update from where Malinda to switch to a

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,860
new version is only operating when

139
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,680
nearly downloaded content is fully ready

140
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,320
very very teddy

141
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,329
so what does F&I provides every night

142
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:09,140
itself is free free distributed in BSD

license which allow commercial use and

145
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,180
is optimized for uncle SM course by

146
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,010
means of as IPC and well structure

147
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,140
design security is an important

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,720
consideration as well in addition ni

149
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,029
provides first board development

150
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:36,980
mechanism inspired by dynasty probes in

151
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,579
order to perform provide direct

152
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:46,220
atomization PPD or PTO every

153
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,550
Megacon attempts to eliminate the risk

154
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,449
it is seen at an available system by

155
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,420
small hips TCP and under five pages and

156
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,649
Sally cistern isolation

157
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,050
the next generation our device even

158
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,949
Americana is then after basic implement

159
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,560
a solution nation microkernel to act

160
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,740
Asia lose like the train to Tygra

161
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,060
well even americano is a hypervisor and

162
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,990
to isolate the two domain one is

163
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,779
untrusted domain where applications ones

164
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,740
I mean no more application runs in

165
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,649
untrusted domain and another is the

166
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:41,329
trustee domain where everything is free

167
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,190
very dated even I first fundamental this

168
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,760
principle

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,300
f9l for Mike O'Connell that is to

170
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,699
improve an aerospace a threat management

171
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,920
obviously only in the previous kernel

172
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,410
and everything is almost built from

173
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,310
scratch to facilitate the features uncle

174
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,910
is M series including NBIC

175
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,930
which stands for the Nestea interest

176
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,350
appalled be pending and amp you memory

177
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:23,120
protection units memory management is

178
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,220
split into three concept first memory

179
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,750
poor repents and managers area of the

180
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,810
physical address space with special

181
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,470
attribute second first Pope has

182
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,319
described and always lie and always

183
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,740
always online region our airspace

184
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,430
unlike other air for information fresh

185
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,170
average in even I represent MPU region

186
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,649
instead and that the saucer is edge

187
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,500
space which may are of this phrase

188
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,699
baseball pages

189
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,920
okay

190
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,070
interaction during in FN I can can be

191
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,449
handled in both kernel kernel thread our

192
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:26,199
use use username your level thread to

193
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,360
improve power efficiency even I

194
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,880
introduced ticklish colonel who results

195
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,089
better cannot consumption than the

196
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,940
camera approach to them by assistant sis

197
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,459
antique thicker so idea article external

198
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:51,569
as CPU only black by even instead

199
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:57,639
periodical periodical timer so let's

200
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,490
compare think of the can't connect

201
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,569
switch or hair it's in the countries

202
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:09,399
okay this is a the Darwin illustrator oh

203
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,990
hey in canis wish

204
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,670
and ticklish scheduling can avoid pan

205
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:28,650
keep in or hey how can it how can you do

206
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:35,350
so ticklish Colonel I mean in f9

207
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,530
implantation he enter ticklish right

208
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,620
right before going to see idle state and

209
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,580
the set interval own next the timer in

210
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,070
hurrah

211
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,000
tell her next event so you can you can

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,410
see if you're your timer is periodic

213
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,540
your interval Henry's it wake up

214
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,520
periodically it can sum or more energy

215
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,100
but if your colonel is only joined by

216
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,910
external event so such as Network such

217
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:16,120
as touch touch cooling event it can gain

218
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,230
more reduction in energy

219
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,020
okay so I also I would like to introduce

220
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,070
the kpop information in f9 Pepperell is

221
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,940
a dynamic instrumentation inspired by

222
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,930
Linux kernel allow developer to gather

223
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,380
additional information about kernel

224
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,730
operation without recompiling or

225
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,730
reporting kernel k problems in ethnic

226
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,020
can be used for both year update or

227
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,640
remote debugging purpose at the moment

228
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,270
even I provide a partial parties support

229
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,520
and in the sang system profile so you

230
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,940
can even monitor the system uses in

231
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,300
resource and figure out the location you

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,800
want to atomize everyone know is

233
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,160
commercialized by Genesee company which

234
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,790
is look it based on a place in USA

235
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,440
generously the company use F night to

236
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,529
provide small solution for IOT call rate

237
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,410
is K 1 so communication between device

238
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,209
and a server is based on web web sake

239
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,750
cocoa and that the data is change is

240
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,110
incorrect so you can see the device is

241
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,800
puppet based on call this M which is is

242
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,040
very efficient imposed a power and the

243
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,579
security design piece set is the next

244
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,359
generation of f9 Mike O'Connell we learn

245
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,500
from Mike wiser which is a sub-project

246
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,939
of embedded operating system and we

247
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:28,270
implement f9 Mike O'Connell in basic as

248
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,530
a lightweight alternative piece a cam

249
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,080
first it has a memory protection of

250
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,130
colas and included other vents

251
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,169
Inc and we we @m mention I mentioned

252
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,260
before is heavy inspired by SEO for

253
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,660
moving other mechanism with security in

254
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,450
enhancement I mean the security

255
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,340
enhancement and the facility sure

256
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,049
outside the kernel a is talky is to know

257
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,049
how I hope he devices and is very light

258
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,650
way you can see it only to 2000 Lyon Co

259
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,960
P side use capability or key to managing

260
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,890
resource with with with with the ad or

261
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:29,549
object with reference and a state of

262
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:38,400
ring okay this is really it only

263
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,870
provides us three system call which

264
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,490
consists of sender receiver and ear to

265
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,270
send us almost the same as SEO for pass

266
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,150
so I'm going to to the president and

267
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:36,260
memory protection no Canada there is but

268
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,040
there is a protocol of MPU is memory

269
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,660
unit and we can use this unit to provide

270
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,100
basic memory memory manager for cortex-m

271
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:55,190
application or kernel so on cortex m4

272
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,070
there is eight region you can you can

273
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,260
set it on it and on m7 you have sixteen

274
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,080
region you can set on it and every MP

275
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,440
you region you can set some feet some

276
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,370
feature on it like the TX capability or

277
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,880
the the assess assess permission for the

278
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,630
user or not user for the privilege or

279
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,650
for on privilege and the most important

280
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,110
thing is you can set this execution

281
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,110
never bit and the execution number bit

282
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,350
is is to represent one thing is if you

283
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,160
enable this bit this region will not

284
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,670
take as executable memory so you can

285
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,790
prevent some some attack like the buffer

286
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,940
overflow attack on it ok so there's a on

287
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,590
CODIS and there is the the memory region

288
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,600
is flat so on

289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,640
for example codecs and phone they will

290
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,330
have 40 gabite of the memory like the

291
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,860
diagram and so now if we consider there

292
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,530
is a business running now

293
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,110
and the PC register is at this address

294
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,920
tackle put the malicious code at the two

295
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,150
zero zero four zero address and use any

296
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,510
way to set the PC go to this address

297
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,970
then the CP will try to fetch the next

298
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,160
construction at this address right so if

299
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,760
this is done then the attack is bingo

300
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,610
but today if we set in the NP region as

301
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,830
set it to the lab execute like like the

302
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,040
yellow part of them memory so MPU region

303
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,710
we can set the pace to to this address

304
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,110
and and we can see this this place for

305
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,750
example is a peripheral for me for maybe

306
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,990
serial or other scenes so we can set the

307
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,330
size is that the power of 2 to 12 this

308
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,940
is a restriction of this is that we can

309
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,590
take we can only take the power of two

310
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,060
size for for the for the memory protects

311
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,170
size and so so in this case the range is

312
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,050
from two zero zero four zero zero two

313
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,420
two zero zero zero five zero two zero

314
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,700
and if attacker tries to fetch the

315
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,200
instruction in to zero four zero eight

316
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,300
as the next instruction in this time MP

317
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,640
you will catch this value memory SS and

318
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,820
trigger CPU to generate a memory manage

319
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,380
fault exception so this time attacker

320
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,970
won't execute this code but captured by

321
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,980
the memory manual fault handler and then

322
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,710
we prevent the attack on this situation

323
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:23,300
we can use the open-open OCD and gdb to

324
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,330
to to simulate this this problem

325
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,440
so we use of LCD and enable gdb by

326
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,529
August and to the port and monitor set

327
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,230
some host to enable reset and load it

328
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,250
again and we can pretty fine some some

329
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,330
memory memory address to to to the MP u

330
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,649
then we can set the attribute to 2 MP

331
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:52,279
you register and and using our LCD

332
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,390
provides the the instruction and MW the

333
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,340
memory write a word to this to this

334
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,279
register address and we can we can

335
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,880
redefine the PC by using MW w222

336
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,019
to simulate the problem we I mentioned

337
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:17,139
before so we can then then see the

338
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:21,519
result on gdb that it will cut by the

339
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:28,120
memory management exception handler okay

340
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,059
[Applause]

341
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:37,820
and I was not for me reason make saya

342
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,168
and here's some time

343
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,690
okay okay this is a here is a case study

344
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,129
for the artists into integration here

345
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:04,980
artists stands for the imputation like

346
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,990
free artists or other invitations for

347
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,389
example an embedded operating system so

348
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:20,940
in the case study will show how bistek

349
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,320
hypervisor works the integration the

350
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,909
integration is not artists API immersion

351
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:32,039
layer of simulator

352
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,490
instead it one's actual artists color

353
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,600
derived from the airport including the

354
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,379
schedule and other system layer

355
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:49,649
implement some mechanism for example the

356
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:53,840
first surfacing is location and that

357
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,190
duration of a presence is an object like

358
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:05,610
task queue and unhip also he had has to

359
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,009
provide meal tests with priority

360
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:12,499
inheritance to ensure operating

361
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:15,659
operation tile and the time sizing with

362
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:21,600
prehension and as far as you can see

363
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,169
from the diagram there are two contacts

364
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,269
in artists and the peacenik integration

365
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:33,379
the first thing you have to consider is

366
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:34,889
context

367
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:39,539
another is inter a context so think

368
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,779
about the scenario that the inner

369
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,519
context how the interaction case works

370
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,629
first we have a piece it has to model a

371
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:53,419
great experience

372
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:58,410
used to run Attis also if

373
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,140
has to be tweaked to the hand I mean the

374
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,400
the Indra Hendrik all such as eyes are

375
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,510
and finally he had improvised some

376
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:19,800
virtual interrupts so virtual interrupts

377
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,850
um if there is some message model in the

378
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,970
form of a supervised call and Telus

379
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,780
system gets introduced in angry X so and

380
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,900
we at M so if you have your house is

381
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,950
pest peasant and we at n P side is a can

382
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,680
directly use SG to be the two Peter pace

383
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,450
of hypervisor if you your Howie is not a

384
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,110
beast beast be at em for example v7m

385
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,650
such as college and and three or and

386
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,060
four pieces provides

387
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,910
image emulation call for the system

388
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,370
gates and add hosts versus send sense

389
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,290
piece piece like I peed message through

390
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,190
SG in order to request a context switch

391
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,370
and enable to enable or disable

392
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,370
interrupts so let's check it at parent

393
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,300
again so you're single so it is seen at

394
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,090
us like we are hos is already implement

395
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,620
and P SEC would act as the hypervisor

396
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,200
provides some virtual inter-facility to

397
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,980
perform the word virtual interrupts as

398
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,100
well to manage this page loop multi

399
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,990
press the contact the interaction text

400
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,310
so let's to make a song conclusion

401
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,840
minimize tcp is

402
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,590
is a physical for beauty insecure out

403
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,070
the operating system and over base

404
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,860
design bring just so-so isolation

405
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,700
mechanism it is known to work and

406
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,980
already used in some commercial products

407
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,460
College m4 processor enable real-time

408
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,130
ability and the memory protection

409
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,110
facility a 2d web hyper most low-cost

410
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,730
platform and every micro cannot already

411
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,380
packets this advantage to build an

412
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,350
efficient hypervisor and artists

413
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,520
infrastructure already so we would like

414
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,330
to ask the developer to post some

415
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,940
attention and f9 macoco naughty women

416
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,520
and she we show some use case successful

417
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,150
story our and the same simple request to

418
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,410
us to input F in America not so do you

419
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,580
have any question

420
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,820
firefire

421
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,760
what are the benefits of starting a new

422
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,370
codebase and not taking a CEO for as

423
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,110
your starting point and tweaking

424
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,060
okay that's good question

425
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,840
the crisis is why not just tweak SEO for

426
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,590
photo ID I always SEO for a cell

427
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,640
consists of more than 9,000 laniel call

428
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,120
but for the devices like collision and

429
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,140
three and four

430
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,030
you have limit limit drain and the

431
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,770
fresh-faced storage so it is almost

432
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,150
impossible to use as info territory but

433
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,050
we we can take advantage from SEO for

434
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,740
such as capability system so you can

435
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,480
deploy I mean to find grandpa traction

436
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,120
for given resources with timing

437
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,450
considered consideration is is quite

438
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:49,550
which is quite important for IOT devices

439
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,430
yeah the question is interesting because

440
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:17,610
as you say most of the code generated by

441
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,530
SEO for preprocessor understand some

442
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,800
former models but but it's quite a

443
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,090
difficult for us to maintain so we try

444
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,360
to F night to listen Fi

445
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,530
it has more about two weeks but for SEO

446
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,500
for I cannot imagine a the feasibility

447
00:32:44,570 --> 00:33:00,420
do have an sorry I could not say because

448
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,230
I haven't signed an NDA so I can as

449
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,360
sorry seconds that stays exactly model

450
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,760
but well I always already work ant

451
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,420
simulation environment for the face face

452
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,840
model based assistance so the working

453
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,020
prototype is already works so you can I

454
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,410
can show you of time so if you use Andes

455
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,040
at M

456
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,800
it has mechanisms like system gates

457
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,150
which is quite efficient you can

458
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,260
eliminate as far I mean you can

459
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,340
eliminate additional it each section

460
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,880
without without frequent contest I mean

461
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,790
the accession return okay yeah so if

462
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,840
your lack of the season get you you have

463
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,250
to implement to switch by by just not

464
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,120
normalization and

465
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:25,989
and hey all question okay okay night

466
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,869
next to is my pleasure to present my

467
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,040
Mike O'Connell and the and the incoming

468
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,730
pisac just an instant difference so you

469
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,099
can check the first one it is essential

470
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:48,129
material discussing about the migration

471
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:58,450
from l3 l4 and HDL for in 20 years and a

472
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,750
triode the second one is the lecture as

473
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,990
the intimate tutorials is quite quite

474
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,010
interesting and informative and if you

475
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,200
you are interesting in the degrees Cano

476
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,960
you can check out the last last one we

477
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,170
have an another presentation you can

478
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,730
find SlideShare discussing about degrees

479
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,530
kernel k timer and how polish em works

480
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,570
okay since Paul come in thank you

481
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:40,729
[Applause]
