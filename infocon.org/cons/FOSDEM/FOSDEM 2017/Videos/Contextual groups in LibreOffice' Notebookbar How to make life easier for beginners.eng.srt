1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Oh

2
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,690
the question was because of the

3
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,870
lifestream too boring

4
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,820
okay so contextual groups you have seen

5
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,949
what I will talk about it's it's the

6
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,920
idea behind this realization notebook

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,260
buyers are just a blank canvas you can't

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,739
put anything on to it and it should be

9
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,590
enable you to quickly deal with the

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,280
features of the program so how was the

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,770
idea to create a notebook bar and in

12
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,140
particular see contextual upsets what I

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,240
will talk about and I think it's always

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
a good idea to take a look back to the

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,899
start where we come from and especially

16
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,890
if we make huge changes to the UI for

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,670
those of you that are not really young

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,790
star writer from the late 90s

19
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,600
there's a couple of toolbars just pretty

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,159
nice you can see that we do not change

21
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,220
too much but I will I would have

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,770
problems to deal with all the icons and

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,350
buttons not that easy and it didn't

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,799
change

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,049
there's the updates got a little bit

26
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,740
cleaner from the UI but the

27
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,189
functionality behind the toolbar is very

28
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,649
complex you get a lot of features and

29
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,700
functions and you need to understand

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,510
what an icon means is let's say this

31
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,480
compass rose I believe it's a navigator

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,940
but you have to know that there is a

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,900
navigator to understand what a navigator

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,160
I can means and after that you can use

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,520
this control to show it or not

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,130
and later version with more clean your I

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,130
okay

38
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,500
and this liber ovens starting from three

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,230
five four and down there five you didn't

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,930
change too much to be honest I puts the

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,790
images onto the presentation to

42
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,370
illustrate that our functionality grows

43
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,510
and that we get more and Clarence a tuba

44
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,700
it's the opposite it's true we are

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,030
working on a better UI we do it for

46
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,420
years for more than 10 years and it gets

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,030
better and better for instance it is the

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,950
two toolbars at top presenting is the

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,959
most important information to the user

50
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
it's pretty clear it's similar to other

51
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,430
programs and you can use it easily and

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,099
this introduction of the sidebar check

53
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,819
it here in the lower part we get more

54
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,599
room in the conventional toolbars so it

55
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,889
was but it is still a clean interface

56
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,970
and yes failed for for my site so

57
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,400
question remains what is it good for

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,879
what what are toolbars good first of all

59
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,159
the toolbar is a quick access to

60
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,909
frequently used functions often is it is

61
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,290
abused for to present all the features

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,560
and awesomeness to the user I guess

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,010
every one of you knows a program that is

64
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,029
hard to use

65
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,180
if you don't often start it and freaking

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,669
to use it because every function is

67
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,010
cluttered in the toolbar it's just a

68
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,680
convenience feature for the experts but

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,520
it must be and especially for a office

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,440
suit like HIPAA the office which is used

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,720
for many users there has to be a precise

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,889
and clear concept behind it so quickly

73
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,000
quick access to frequently used

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,889
functions that's the purpose of a

75
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:51,460
toolbar

76
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,340
what I scribble above by the way is an

77
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,650
example I will talk link about it

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,139
and

79
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,990
it should illustrate the idea it is

80
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,560
fruitless icons that you may know you of

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,280
course you can figure out that a disc

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,740
second eye confirms left it is is likely

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,139
a function to safe who document we made

84
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,850
number of your eye contests there were

85
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,190
last year's that shows that a disc is

86
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,919
really a good indicator for safe but

87
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,720
next to it left knew it could be

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,639
something different but it isn't because

89
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,690
it's the leftmost icon back to my notes

90
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,520
increase in functionality I thought

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,460
about it you have to trust the icon the

92
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,940
safe icon is very clear and it's a it's

93
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,030
obvious but it happens there but if you

94
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,430
move icons around and if you would move

95
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,740
the new icon from the left most position

96
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,500
to somewhere else in the toolbar no one

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,810
would be able to find it because the new

98
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,000
icon is not that striking clear it is

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,070
often called a muscle memory you know

100
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,050
where you have to click to find a

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,020
certain function all the clipart stuff

102
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,530
undo redo left right not set clear of

103
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,820
always but copy/paste it's next to undo

104
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,030
redo so it's kind of positional

105
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,400
information that you are using to figure

106
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,070
out where a function is on the toolbar

107
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,460
and the most vers all these things is

108
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,570
that new uses require to learn all this

109
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,229
stuff it has to look at the toolbar gets

110
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,200
it to tips and from it and understand

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,860
what it means to show icons like this

112
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,289
one or it's just a stupid example let's

113
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,180
say this one

114
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,830
I wouldn't know so what could you do to

115
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,320
improve the usability phasing all of the

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,410
issues you could of course remove

117
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,870
functionality from the toolbar make it

118
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,530
cleaner it's a good approach it puts a

119
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,530
question mark on trade I think

120
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,590
developers are not so easy to convince

121
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,979
to remove functionality from stool okay

122
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,979
so let's try another option grouping

123
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,110
grouping is always a good idea grouping

124
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,840
makes it easy to quickly find a trunk in

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,720
the amount of information left most kind

126
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,370
of file information the next one is

127
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,190
about clipboard and so on so this one

128
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,760
it's just a little bit space between

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,500
groups and you get an additional

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,160
information you can of course have also

131
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,820
labels under it it's not easy to read it

132
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,060
writes file clip word format objects and

133
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,360
help just an example if you label

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,590
cgroups

135
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,200
it gives an additional information for

136
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,050
the users what else you can use labels

137
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,440
for the functionality because at least

138
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,830
me I always struggle it was undo redo is

139
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,940
it really left to go back not so sure if

140
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,099
there is a label for this function I'm

141
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,479
absolutely clear and if see style this I

142
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,190
can here the target whatever it is if

143
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,320
there is a label style you will know

144
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,309
that it opens some menu for applying a

145
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:45,279
style to Z to the option so at least see

146
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,790
less often or less well-known functions

147
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,740
should get a label and finally it's

148
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,490
always a good idea to focus the user ID

149
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,199
attention to feature that you want to

150
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:06,230
acknowledge to the user so it's just an

151
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,399
example the left-most is new you want to

152
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,129
get see use users are looking for a new

153
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,490
so you make it a larger icon users

154
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,399
should use styling feature so you make

155
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,990
style I can larger and of course you can

156
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,660
do the same for objects and perhaps also

157
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,699
help if you want to draw their attention

158
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,279
to these features and it works even

159
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,740
better if you add some more information

160
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,379
to it if you add a modality like color

161
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:41,509
in this case or they add more details to

162
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,220
the icons for instance if you have a

163
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,949
very plain I can seem and you add more

164
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,589
details to the relevant icons it pops

165
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,550
out of the crowd of the other functions

166
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,189
those features are possible so what did

167
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,300
we do we put it onto a contextual groups

168
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,230
it's because it's a simple canvas you

169
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,699
can enlarge the icons within the

170
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,750
restrictions that we have in the office

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,139
we have three different sizes so icons

172
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,170
on the toolbar are small size medium

173
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,639
sized and large sized in this case and

174
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,680
the large icons are the most relevant

175
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,439
functions I guess people are looking for

176
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:27,910
safe for paste which has also a

177
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,819
drop-down menu where you can get paste

178
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:36,699
special and whatever option paste has

179
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,639
style gets a big menu yes I shall in in

180
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,240
in advance the idea is that we want to

181
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,819
promote style rather than the direct

182
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,220
formatting and style should open see

183
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,529
many of those all the styles and user

184
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,860
can quickly change the appearing of a

185
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,839
text rather than all the formatting

186
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,610
options and all the tools the right part

187
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,720
this one

188
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,529
are hidden away a little bit because the

189
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,870
idea has said our new user

190
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,759
we call him Benjamin this Benjamin would

191
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,459
likely just write as simple text and he

192
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,029
wants to make sure it is saved

193
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,850
that's a reason to make the save big and

194
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,550
he wants to format it in a certain way

195
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,310
that's all but sometimes he may want to

196
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,670
add a table and if you edit a table you

197
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,420
know or in the past rather in the past

198
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,899
we had changing you I had flipped from a

199
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,750
text editing mode to the table editing

200
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,290
mode which was kind of awkward the idea

201
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,620
is that most parts of the toolbar should

202
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,540
remain static and only few things have

203
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,660
to be depending on the context that's

204
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,449
why this thing is called contextual

205
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,779
groups the rightmost part is not anymore

206
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,660
tools because if you are in a table

207
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,559
editing mode you cannot add or maybe you

208
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,579
can add an image but you likely want to

209
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,769
style the table that's why is the table

210
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,860
style has a big icon you may also want

211
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,629
to change the background of stainable

212
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,139
and access also a border but what else

213
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:36,829
there are maybe a lot of more features

214
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:39,829
and the table it could be changed but

215
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,879
it's not what you frequently do so just

216
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,800
this one and similarly for images if you

217
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,350
are in an image edit mode if you have an

218
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,430
image selected you get everything is

219
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,220
static from the left part and disabled

220
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,290
in case you cannot use it formatting

221
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,269
text formatting is not available for

222
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,449
images but styling could be an option

223
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,059
right now we do not have a style feature

224
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,240
for images but it could be added in the

225
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,300
future for instance make it a water sign

226
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,579
I believe it's possible right now

227
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,170
I'm running a little bit out of times

228
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,990
I'm going over it more quickly I think

229
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,779
for images relevant information or

230
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,740
element functionality its cropping it's

231
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,970
at least me I do it quite often and

232
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,759
reset it's not that easy to find today

233
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,509
we do we hide the original size it's a

234
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,790
function is called original sites we

235
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,009
hided really good away in at least an

236
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,500
impress it was not so easy because

237
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,649
switching the resolution of the

238
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,680
presentation back and resetting the

239
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,490
image size was not easy to find it's a

240
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,540
function that is often used or else a

241
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,149
chart mode of course if we are in a

242
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,029
chart we need to get some kind of

243
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,779
styling feature which is on the same

244
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,779
position you can trust that a big icon

245
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,959
on this position will present you this a

246
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,810
kind of preset with something that

247
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,360
enables you to quickly switch from one

248
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,690
kind of visualization or modification to

249
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,779
another one and the child would

250
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,060
for instance changed from a bar chart to

251
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,480
scatter plot or sweetie chart whatever

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,110
and finally was shapes

253
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,880
wasn't that easy to find relevant

254
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,700
functions but similar for this

255
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,290
and this one is writer for writer

256
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,200
it was writer how bright Alex for calc

257
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,589
and impress it should be similar to

258
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:18,020
writer another goal is to not only have

259
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,870
a static part within one module so

260
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,990
writer with file Clippard and formatting

261
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,470
option but also for other modules here

262
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,670
in calc and impress you also get file

263
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,240
Clippard and formatting in this case

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,160
there's slightly different features but

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,529
or properties but the same functionality

266
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,370
behind it and again the rightmost part

267
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,170
is reserved for things that you

268
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,450
contextually change in case of draw it

269
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,350
could look like this you have you don't

270
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,250
have usually formatting features so it's

271
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,279
rather kind of positioning that you want

272
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,510
to change positioning feels a little bit

273
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,270
like formatting so the idea was to put

274
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,910
instead of say formatting the position

275
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,830
information into this menu which means

276
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,970
you have to disabled if you get to a

277
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,350
text in draw you disable the positioning

278
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,920
features and show formatting stuff in

279
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,900
the contextual section see lowest part

280
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,260
here

281
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,569
don't get a mice yeah

282
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,160
okay so my conclusion the outlook for

283
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,590
the future we of course we need to fix

284
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,950
all the backs stylists do not work

285
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,680
really well all the the ideas of

286
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,660
functions are and not implemented see

287
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,180
aggregated functionality for instance of

288
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,890
manipulating images it's not variable

289
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,520
right now

290
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,589
we have box for the when the size is

291
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,640
shrinked normal toolbar gets a kind of

292
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,079
Chevron where all the remaining items

293
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,180
are collected and the menu we do not

294
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,000
have it right our at least it's not

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,110
really well working but if everything is

296
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,240
done we need of course a better

297
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,270
configurability right now it's it's a

298
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,630
it's a technical way to deal with it

299
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,660
it's a UI fire that you change with

300
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,900
Glade and you do not have a good means

301
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,740
to add your own your eye fire so it's a

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,280
dirty hack but you can you can change it

303
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,630
but it's very dirty if that's all done I

304
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,810
think we need to modernize see sidebar

305
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,720
meaning the zhaibar should also be gets

306
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,860
a freedom to be configured by the user

307
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,720
and if I say it configured by the user I

308
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,050
have something in mind like what Silla

309
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,940
is doing for the Firefox in a in the

310
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,970
customized mode it should be kind of

311
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,940
visible configuration you will select

312
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,280
the you know command and drag and drop

313
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,350
it to the position where you want to get

314
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,790
it it has to be as simple as possible

315
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,080
and in a in a way that's a challenge for

316
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,180
us because in MOT Silla you have 20 or

317
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,450
so functions I get a few more because at

318
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,490
block is its add-on so we have hundreds

319
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,610
of functions that needs to be offered to

320
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,000
the user and see you

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,140
is more complex in this case but I think

322
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,860
it should be easy in a way that every

323
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,140
user can configure his own hue I simply

324
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,870
share it with other or download for

325
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:22,710
instance so and finally all the kudos go

326
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,900
to the developers and you can read the

327
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,870
whole story background information on

328
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,260
the block

329
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:43,790
[Applause]
