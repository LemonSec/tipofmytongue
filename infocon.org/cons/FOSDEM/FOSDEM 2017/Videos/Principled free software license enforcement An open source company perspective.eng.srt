1
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:25,320
okay so I'm going to to start so this

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,340
talk is about GPL enforcement this is so

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,760
I kind of envisioned that that Karen

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
and/or Bradley would be in the room and

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,780
this talk is sort of in some ways

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,110
conceived of as a sort of troll of Karen

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,790
and Bradley but but I think for various

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,590
reasons they're they're not going to be

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,940
here because they're busy with other

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,399
very important things so that's that's

11
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,250
okay that's actually maybe maybe better

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,840
for my purposes but this is kind of a

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,079
talk about GPL enforcement from

14
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,110
perspective of some of us lawyers at Red

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,219
Hat I should I should explain I'm a

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,850
lawyer at at Red Hat and we've been

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,030
we've been talking about this topic

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,700
among ourselves quite a lot recently and

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,770
I'll explain a little bit like why this

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,049
is an interesting topic to us and then

21
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,119
like how so I want to sort of like

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,070
presents the sort of very very rough

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,159
tentative framework we're thinking about

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,920
for how we're looking at the question of

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,470
Glenda's GPL enforcement appropriate

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,170
when is litigation appropriate in a GPL

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,890
enforcement situation and then if to the

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,840
extent I have time I'm going to talk

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,579
about some related issues that don't

30
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,210
quite fit neatly into that idea of a

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,430
framework and also so I should also

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,450
explain this is so usually when I give

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,369
talks they're just like you know my own

34
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,970
thoughts on things and this is a little

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,710
bit different because some of the ideas

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,369
are things that I've sort of developed

37
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,469
collectively with some of my colleagues

38
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,170
at Red Hat on the legal team and so

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,340
that's that's like different from the

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,889
usual talk I get but this is not this is

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,140
still very much you know my own thoughts

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,650
my own perspective

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,540
I'm just influenced by some of the ideas

44
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,980
of my colleagues so it's kind of a

45
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,379
mixture of my own ideas and my

46
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,970
colleagues ideas and it's so it's not

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,950
you know it's not an official Red Hat

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,950
talk by any means but it definitely

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,959
grows out of the experience we've had at

50
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,329
Red Hat and thinking about this issue

51
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:36,579
okay so why why are we even in red hats

52
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,129
legal department looking at this topic

53
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,439
of GPL enforcement I mean GPL

54
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,480
enforcement's always been an important

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,299
part of what's going on in free software

56
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,290
and open-source law but it was you know

57
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,940
to me it was like this topic that was

58
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,840
kind of in a way minor in nature I was

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,569
sort of primarily interested in it by

60
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,129
the time I started working at Red Hat I

61
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,500
got interested in it because I noticed

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,019
that there were Red Hat customers and

63
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,480
Red Hat partners that were very you know

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,200
very very concerned about the risks of

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,989
GPL enforcement litigation perhaps

66
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,940
unreasonably concerned and I used to

67
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,980
give talks to lawyers where I would

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,280
really de-emphasize the risk of GPL

69
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,709
enforcement in general or open source

70
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,629
license enforcement in general which i

71
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:30,069
think is actually accurate I think that

72
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,739
there really is not a lot of active

73
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,409
enforcement of of these licenses and

74
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,639
that's actually the one of the most

75
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,260
interesting features of this whole

76
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,290
system so I really tried to de-emphasize

77
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,569
the the risk because I saw that it was

78
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,609
hindering to some degree adoption and

79
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,989
and participation by those companies in

80
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,579
recent years this has become I think a

81
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,540
more interesting topic so a few things

82
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,159
have been happening

83
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,139
that sort of make it more interesting

84
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,560
one is that in the US and maybe some

85
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,879
other countries as well we're starting

86
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,620
to see a bit of an uptick in GPL

87
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,510
litigation brought by commercial

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,720
entities so typically this is kind of a

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,529
variant of a what bradley Koon calls a

90
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,380
proprietary relicensing type of

91
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,668
situation where you have a company that

92
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,490
sort of monopolized GPL code base and is

93
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,569
for whatever reason bringing

94
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,020
lawsuits alleging Jeep GPL violation

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,369
copyright infringement based on GPL

96
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:36,699
violation with you know with some sort

97
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,479
of business goal of monetization or or

98
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,139
or what have you

99
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,270
scrum so we saw that within the US with

100
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,749
the this very complex set of cases

101
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:48,129
associated with a versus odda and simple

102
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,909
where that took place a couple years ago

103
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,999
what's also happening also in the past

104
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,589
few years is the software freedom

105
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,389
Conservancy so Karen and Bradley's

106
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,029
organization has been they've been

107
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,490
involved with GPL enforcement really

108
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,740
from the beginning but I think in the

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,309
past few years they've they've kind of

110
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,550
taken on a more active or expanded role

111
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,119
so Sol Conservancy started the GPL

112
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,830
compliance project for Linux developer

113
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,589
so they started doing GPL enforcement

114
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,479
for Linux kernel copyright holders which

115
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,830
is something they hadn't done in the

116
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,669
past hey Bradley so so so so that's like

117
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,719
so that's that in a sense in a political

118
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,719
sense increased the stakes because the

119
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,689
kernel is such an important project

120
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,779
commercially and it's so pervasive that

121
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,430
once one's Conservancy started doing

122
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,930
direct GPL enforcement for kernel

123
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,099
copyright holders that that was you know

124
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,559
sort of inherently a high profile

125
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:57,159
activity and then of course Conservancy

126
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,839
has been funding the hell would be

127
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,999
VMware lawsuit I guess is part of that

128
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,949
GPL compliance project for Linux

129
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,499
developers so that was filed a couple

130
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:09,039
years ago and it was dismissed currently

131
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,669
on appeal I believe still on appeal but

132
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,680
also I don't know if anyone has heard of

133
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,389
some of you have heard of Patrick

134
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,939
McCarty so what's going on in parallel

135
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,579
is to conservancies activity and this

136
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,759
increased commercial gpio forcement

137
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,969
there's a Linux kernel developer named

138
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,579
Patrick McCarty who over the past couple

139
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,089
of years has been bringing a large

140
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:37,870
series of lawsuits in Germany alleging

141
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,029
GPL violations and we don't have very

142
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,040
good information about this

143
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,220
part because there's the German civil

144
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,560
litigation system is is sort of very non

145
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,920
transparent by default and so there's

146
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,230
been just this atmosphere of rumor

147
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,080
around McCarty's lawsuits but but

148
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,960
there's been a lot of concern among

149
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,790
among you know commercial entities

150
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,370
involved in the linux ecosystem about

151
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,820
what McCarty has been doing basically so

152
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,770
we don't have like reliable information

153
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,110
but what some have said is that McCarty

154
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,100
is basically adopting a kind of

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,440
extortion it's sort of strategy around

156
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,290
bringing litigation sort of in a sense

157
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,140
getting companies to agree to these

158
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,640
settlements which have penalty clauses

159
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,650
and then the penalty clause is triggered

160
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,020
by an allegation of a subsequent GPL

161
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,690
violation and it's sort of meperidine

162
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,280
have knowledge about this

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,670
McCarty has been you know amassing

164
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,090
significant damage Awards or settlement

165
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,250
awards based on this this kind of

166
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,840
strategy so so the assumption that his

167
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,180
the motivation of Accardi has been in a

168
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,720
sense of wealth acquisition rather than

169
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,880
compliance percent compliance for some

170
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,100
sort of social purpose so the

171
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,000
Conservancy and the FSF published last

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,850
year I think or the year before a set of

173
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,920
principles of community oriented GPL

174
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,160
enforcement you should you know look it

175
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,000
up I won't go into into them here

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
actually and I don't think that that

177
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,060
Conservancy has actually given public

178
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,370
talks about the details of these

179
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,790
principles but I think these principles

180
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,130
clearly came out of the concern over

181
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,520
McCarty and a desire to emphasize the

182
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,030
difference between conservancies you

183
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,580
know rationale and methodology for

184
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,820
bringing GPL enforcement and McCarty's

185
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,220
tactics or alleged tactics so so that's

186
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,960
the the purpose I think the primary

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,090
purpose that that the principles will

188
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,990
serve

189
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,710
so why is this interesting to read out

190
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,450
so everyone one interesting thing is

191
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,400
that I mean companies have not really

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,190
publicly talked about this issue at all

193
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,450
Karen and Bradley talked a lot about GPL

194
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,010
enforcement you know we we just we don't

195
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,360
really see companies publicly willing to

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,290
talk about this issue but there's

197
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,000
there's a lot of back-channel discussion

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,250
among especially legal representatives

199
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,200
of companies about McCarty and so forth

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,010
but no one's really known from from a

201
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,120
corporate point of view is really

202
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,190
talking about this issue so we sort of

203
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,560
think that it's probably time for a

204
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,970
company that's you know especially

205
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,180
involved in a lot of development of GPL

206
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,190
licensed open-source software to start

207
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,530
talking about this for for Red Hat it's

208
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,910
particularly significant for a lot of

209
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,130
reasons Red Hat distributes lots of

210
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,160
upstream GPL software Red Hat uses the

211
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,930
GPL for a lot of the software it

212
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,160
develops Red Hat has a lot of employees

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,370
who contributed GPL license projects and

214
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,530
many of these employees I would say are

215
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,710
sympathetic to the GPL enforcement being

216
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,090
done by the Conservancy and we're you

217
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,080
know we're certainly aware of that

218
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,890
they're very frustrated by the the

219
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,450
degree of non-compliance I think that

220
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,020
they they see so so it's very for

221
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,760
multiple reasons because Red Hat is kind

222
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,110
of standing in a lot of these different

223
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,390
worlds

224
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,310
surrounding the GPL it's it's very

225
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:23,530
relevant for us as a topic so our

226
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,260
perspective is so first um we I think

227
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,910
there's been this this assumption that

228
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,680
companies are just sort of unthinkingly

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,400
opposed to GPL enforcement are we want

230
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,060
to emphasize that that there is a place

231
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,960
for certainly for GPL enforcement and

232
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,040
you know the question is how much

233
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,160
enforcement should there be what is what

234
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
what tactics should be used so we've we

235
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,660
actually think that conservancies

236
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,460
principles are a really good starting

237
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,070
point in terms is really the first group

238
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,490
to try to articulate you know what

239
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,910
what kinds of characteristics legitimate

240
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,320
versus illegitimate GPL enforcement

241
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,910
should have so a very good starting

242
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,240
point we think that that there's more

243
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,700
that can be said about the topic and we

244
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,440
kind of want to research CEO Charles as

245
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,930
starting to think about contributing to

246
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,750
a dialogue on this topic that that sense

247
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,560
Conservancy started so we have a kind of

248
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,360
rough very rough tentative kind of

249
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
framework that with we're discussing

250
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,280
about this where we we think about you

251
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,800
know what are the objectives of

252
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,060
legitimate objectives of GPL enforcement

253
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,270
and GPL compliance and and then what are

254
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,070
the characteristics that that that such

255
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,030
enforcement should have and then what

256
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,240
kinds of tactics are appropriate for for

257
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,480
that kind of enforcement okay so the

258
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,710
objective so for us you know if you go

259
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,160
to conservancies talks on GP enforcement

260
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,770
I think they'll probably emphasize the

261
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,990
the traditional conception of what the

262
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,920
goals of the GPR are so so maximizing or

263
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,890
protecting user freedoms for example we

264
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,470
you know our view is is kind of

265
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,510
different in perspective we we certainly

266
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,320
recognize the importance of of user

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,570
freedoms as part of the design of the

268
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,960
GPL the GPL is designed to do but from

269
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,720
our point of view the the goal that we

270
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,960
we think we want to achieve from GPL

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,900
compliance is promoting more

272
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,000
collaboration and promoting more more

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,820
participation in in developments and I

274
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,230
don't want this just sound like it's

275
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,210
kind of a sort of an old-fashioned type

276
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,680
of open-source versus free software

277
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,000
thing cuz that's not really how I was

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,130
certainly not how I conceived of it it's

279
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,620
we see social as well as economic

280
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,530
benefits to to participation in free

281
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,120
software projects including copula

282
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,810
projects and and we want to promote both

283
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,940
the social and and in the ethical and

284
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,300
the commercial benefits and the other

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,310
objective that we have have sort of been

286
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,260
formulating is this notion of a level

287
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,090
playing field among vendors that the GPL

288
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,270
is something that

289
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,220
attempts to achieve this level playing

290
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,930
field too and it's actually sort of

291
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,340
subsidiary to the previous one because

292
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,670
it the level playing field promotes more

293
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,870
participation in the system okay so

294
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,840
collaboration so the collaboration gulps

295
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,190
you know so this kind of implies that

296
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,220
the goal is not compliance per se or

297
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,250
compliance at all costs its GPL

298
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,850
compliance should aim to maximize

299
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,680
promoting collaboration and

300
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,650
participation including commercial

301
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,580
investments in commercial participation

302
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,000
and it should be measured by you know

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,790
the extent to which it achieves that

304
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,390
kind of goal you know the the we've

305
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,430
we've been talking a lot about about

306
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,490
this idea of uncertainty that that the

307
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,030
more uncertainty you have surrounding

308
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,340
the GPL and GPL compliance and GPL

309
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,210
enforcement the you know the more

310
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,470
concern there is about about

311
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,270
discouraging participation so there's a

312
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,230
certain point where where GPL

313
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,030
enforcement activity might be negative

314
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,710
in nature because it discourages rather

315
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,940
than promote participation and the level

316
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,990
playing field idea from so so the the

317
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,980
the nature of the GPL is this this you

318
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,440
know this basic rule of copyleft they

319
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,830
that distributors can't impose any

320
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,560
further restrictions on downstream users

321
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,020
this is something that that I think

322
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,970
Conservancy actually has emphasized in

323
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,120
some of their talks that that the this

324
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,370
the shared expectation of the no further

325
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,440
restrictions rules creates an incentive

326
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,660
to contribute to GPL license products so

327
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,670
so we we we certainly agree with that

328
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,860
and this is you know historically this

329
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,410
was a big motivation for many companies

330
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,670
that got involved in in Linux

331
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,320
development the the the idea that all

332
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,310
participants all corporate participants

333
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,470
will be held to the same rules was a big

334
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,360
sort of motivator that they all be

335
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,690
limited in their ability to

336
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,310
quiet eyes it's called a restore

337
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,130
prevented from propriety Singh the code

338
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,110
so when you have non-compliance this has

339
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,120
the tendency to reduce participation

340
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,750
because because then you no longer have

341
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,380
this shared the rules are no longer

342
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,190
being observed by all participants so

343
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,920
the the the system is not really working

344
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,510
properly when you have some companies

345
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:59,050
out of compliance so based on those

346
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,130
kinds of objectives we've we've been

347
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,060
thinking about you know what are the

348
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,400
what are the ice a lowercase P

349
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,710
principles because I don't want to kind

350
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,900
of confuse this with the principles that

351
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,370
Conservancy and FSF have been talking

352
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,740
about it's it's these are more like the

353
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,240
characteristics of enforcement that's

354
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,280
that we see is sort of legitimate versus

355
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,050
illegitimate so or

356
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,150
or well-intended versus not well

357
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,920
intended and so there are four basic

358
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,880
principles or characteristics

359
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,730
predictability enforcement should not be

360
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,550
done for gain for financial gain and

361
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,980
transparency the importance of

362
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,360
transparency and the importance of

363
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,710
resolving conflicts of interest

364
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,710
surrounding enforcement so I'll I'll

365
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,460
talk about some of these in a little

366
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,250
more detail so the predictability is

367
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,020
just a very high-level kind of

368
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,180
characteristic this is just the idea you

369
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,630
know I talk about uncertainty so so

370
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,790
enforcement should be done in a way that

371
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,740
is predictable

372
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,380
it should not be done for what will you

373
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,790
know be perceived as arbitrary reasons

374
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,880
because that the arbitrariness is going

375
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,010
to reduce the incentive of companies to

376
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,760
be in compliance

377
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,520
[Music]

378
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,430
and now the the idea that enforcement

379
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,260
should not be done for for financial or

380
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,430
personal gain this is something that

381
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,680
that Conservancy in the FSF have

382
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,190
emphasized so we totally agree with that

383
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,820
as a as a fundamental principle so you

384
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,230
know why it's kind of obvious why this

385
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,280
this is bad so so to do enforcement for

386
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,160
personal gain the way for example

387
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,110
Patrick McCarty is alleged to be doing

388
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,930
you know so enforcement that's done for

389
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,720
personal gain is going to be it's going

390
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,130
to increase that uncertainty because you

391
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,770
know you why should i why should a

392
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,770
company invest in compliance if they

393
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,310
just don't they don't really know you

394
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,450
know they're trying to play by the rules

395
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,590
but they don't know if they're going to

396
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,760
be you know enforced against for some

397
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,530
reason having nothing to do with the

398
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,020
goal of furthering compliance for its

399
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,390
own sake it's a problem this also you

400
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,070
know enforcement for personal gain just

401
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,670
just increases cynicism around the whole

402
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,920
topic of GPL compliance so so the GPL

403
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
sort of loses respect because

404
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,790
enforcement and compliance is seen as

405
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,180
something that is not done for social or

406
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,950
ethical reasons but rather for financial

407
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,210
gain and copyleft is seen as something

408
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,340
that you have to worry about so the

409
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,680
cause for concern rather than something

410
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,030
that is supposed to benefit the

411
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,400
community and this this concern fits in

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,630
with things I've you know talked about

413
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,130
in the past about for Praia Terry

414
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,200
relicensing about that business model

415
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,350
which is now a bit outdated but still to

416
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,490
some degree with us

417
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,880
so proprietary licensing creates that

418
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,260
business model creates incentives for

419
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,360
unreasonably aggressive enforcement

420
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,760
tactics and what some people would call

421
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,970
shakedowns and in sales tactics and and

422
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,370
also encourages the companies that

423
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,900
operate those kinds of business models

424
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,380
to promote very restrictive unreasonably

425
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,790
restrictive interpretations of the GPL

426
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,260
so this is this will you know for many

427
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,510
years this was a concern that what that

428
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,170
surrounded MySQL a B for example and

429
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,049
other companies not

430
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,619
that used similar models so fits in with

431
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:34,210
what we've said about you know what

432
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,259
certainly I have talked about in the

433
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,179
past about about that topic the

434
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,960
transparency value is something that

435
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,139
that concerns he and FSM have not really

436
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,179
talked about in this context so we think

437
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,830
it's something that that's really been

438
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,929
missing from from discussion of this

439
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,499
topic so you might say that that

440
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:00,210
Conservancy has put forward this model

441
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,859
in which nonprofit organizations

442
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,609
especially charitable ones or

443
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,840
specifically charitable ones play up

444
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,230
should play a prominent role in in

445
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,269
license enforcement that being the case

446
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:16,239
the the it becomes very important to

447
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:19,899
have adequate disclosure of donor

448
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,609
relationships for those kinds of

449
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:26,980
organizations we we don't really see the

450
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,570
the kind of disclosure that exists today

451
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,690
being adequate in sort of giving giving

452
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,899
us enough of a degree of confidence

453
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,600
about the motivations for GP enforcement

454
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,460
so so we think there has to be some

455
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,399
pretty high standard for for disclosure

456
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,629
of funding relationships for entities

457
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:48,759
that are engaged in GP enforcement as

458
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,269
nonprofits the another thing that

459
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,509
another issue that that should be

460
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:58,090
discussed in a transparent way is you

461
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,980
know just the methodology for deciding

462
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,070
if your if you do go to litigation why

463
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,350
do you pick one company as a target

464
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,409
versus another so if you're suing you

465
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,059
know you're suing the even given company

466
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,609
what led you to that decision when there

467
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,169
are other companies that are engaging in

468
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,869
the same kind of violation also this is

469
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,159
maybe a fairly controversial point the

470
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,249
thinking about about both McCarty and

471
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:30,159
the hell would be VMware a case we've

472
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,690
been really concerned about the the the

473
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,600
sort of by default secret nature of the

474
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,059
German civil litigation system it's in

475
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,679
this respect so there's a lot of

476
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,400
benefits to

477
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,780
the German Civil Procedure system

478
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,910
relative to what we have in the United

479
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,090
States one one big disadvantage that

480
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,410
that exists is in the u.s. you know

481
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,060
litigate the facts about litigation are

482
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,430
public by default it's the opposite

483
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,010
situation in Germany where where when a

484
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,720
litigation is going on it's very

485
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,090
difficult to get information about about

486
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,570
about those cases and this has this has

487
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,200
been I think sort of used by based on

488
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,540
what we hear by litigants like by

489
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,780
Patrick McCarty is because it the

490
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,950
secrecy surrounding the litigation has

491
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,380
made it made it in difficult if not

492
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,510
impossible for companies that are

493
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,960
targets for potential targets of of his

494
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,060
litigation to share information and

495
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,130
share strategies and so forth so so the

496
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,330
secrecy secrecy is is is very damaging

497
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,830
so you know all things being equal

498
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,210
non-transparent litigation forums should

499
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,950
perhaps be disfavor or there should be a

500
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,560
higher burden to justify bringing a

501
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,300
lawsuit in a in a jurisdiction like

502
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,960
Germany or in some way the the the

503
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,670
problem of the the non transparency

504
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,350
should be addressed and I also the one

505
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,940
thing that concerns me enough is I do

506
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,830
emphasize in the principles is the

507
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,720
importance of confidentiality which is

508
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,610
kind of at odds with this this emphasis

509
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,770
on transparency so we would say that

510
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,500
that that maybe they're overstating the

511
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,960
value of confidentiality perhaps you

512
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,580
should be having more information

513
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,090
disclosed about enforcement cases

514
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,350
including those that are that have not

515
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,510
gone to litigation and then an issue

516
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,790
that has really been ignored almost

517
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,130
completely maybe completely is is the

518
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,180
issue of confidence of interest so

519
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,030
conflict of interests arise in GPL

520
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,600
enforcement and we would say that you

521
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
know these should be acknowledged they

522
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,440
should be disclosed and addressed and

523
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,290
resolved in some way so the the main

524
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,780
concern is this idea of divided

525
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,290
loyalties so if an employee of a company

526
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,300
gets involved in GPL enforcement

527
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,660
activity that activity might be in

528
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,880
conflict with duties that they have to

529
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,260
their employer

530
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,760
imagine if the gpo enforcement involves

531
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,190
some some product of the employer or

532
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,170
some part business partner of the

533
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,780
employer or a major customer of the

534
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,100
employer so there are all sorts of

535
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,320
possibilities for how an employee

536
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,430
getting involved in GP enforcement could

537
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,140
kind of create a conflict a conflict of

538
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,680
interest in relation to the the employee

539
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,540
status as an employee of some company

540
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,510
this doesn't mean that if such conflict

541
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,070
exists the enforcement shouldn't go on

542
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,560
or or or any anything like that it's

543
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,160
just that this these issues have to be

544
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,110
have to be made visible and and they

545
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,750
have to be resolved in some way and they

546
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,950
could be resolved in a way that would

547
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,900
facilitate the enforcement to happen

548
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,080
it's it's just that this this issue has

549
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,510
been as I say kind of ignored and I

550
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,730
think to the extent that that we sort of

551
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,590
get close to talking about it that it

552
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,890
comes up in a way when we talk about

553
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,110
copyright ownership and that's something

554
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,730
that conservative talks about a lot but

555
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,220
the even if employees have copyright

556
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,430
ownership of their of their work their

557
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,500
contributions GPL license projects that

558
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,960
doesn't eliminate this compact of

559
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,580
interest issue because you you can have

560
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,930
copyright on on code and you you could

561
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,550
still give rise to a conflict of

562
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,030
interest situation if you have you're an

563
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,190
employee who has a duty to an employer

564
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,560
or or in other there be other issues as

565
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,240
well like you you maybe maybe you have

566
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,000
your business partner and there's some

567
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,590
conflict

568
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,900
caused by your GPL enforcement activity

569
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,150
in relation to your business partnership

570
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,550
or various various possibilities the one

571
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,810
that we've kind of thought about a lot

572
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:54,000
is this employment situation okay and

573
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,950
and then so what what tactics are

574
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,330
appropriate given those kinds of

575
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,440
objectives and characteristics of you

576
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,480
know good GPL enforcement what are the

577
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,410
appropriate tactics so here we we say

578
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,500
you know education is very important and

579
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,070
litigation should be your last resort

580
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,870
these are also emphasized in the

581
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,550
Conservancy and FSF principles but

582
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,520
there's a kind of a difference in in in

583
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,240
some of the details we talked about so

584
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,460
we agree with with conservancy that you

585
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,040
know non-compliance is generally a

586
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,520
problem of education and awareness and

587
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,890
this can be addressed in many many cases

588
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,610
by working with with the non-compliant

589
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,040
company to learn about how they can come

590
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,770
into compliance and and so you know

591
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,700
there should be a big emphasis on

592
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,500
finding ways to facilitate self

593
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,130
compliance by by a target company that

594
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,330
that is is not comply of the GPL in in

595
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,760
talking about education we don't I would

596
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,450
distinguish that from the the separate

597
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,820
topic of general education initiatives

598
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,430
around license compliance which may have

599
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,460
some value themselves but but I think

600
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,640
the general education around compliance

601
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,170
and and learning about you know

602
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,280
licensing and so forth and and enabling

603
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,050
better tools for compliance that's not

604
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,600
really going to address the the kinds of

605
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,430
GPL non-compliance and I think for

606
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,600
example Conservancy or the FSF or other

607
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,160
GPL license projects not to deal with so

608
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,080
that's kind of a it's more than the

609
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,670
one-on-one education that we're talking

610
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:38,140
about there and so everyone says that

611
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,620
litigation should be a last resort and

612
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,020
you know we certainly agree strongly

613
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,550
with that but I think I would say that

614
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,840
that we

615
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,280
we would emphasize this more than we

616
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,230
think

617
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,650
Conservancy is doing so so what's what's

618
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,720
wrong with with litigation as a solution

619
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,570
to to GPL non-compliance

620
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,900
so litigation is just a really bad

621
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,460
mechanism it's a it's a bad tool it's

622
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,970
it's um too highly structured it's very

623
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,640
expensive very time-consuming the rules

624
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,820
differ from locality to locality so it's

625
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,010
just not not a well-designed mechanism

626
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,640
for achieving compliance in general it

627
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,490
also has the the detrimental feature

628
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,410
that it it is basically a form of

629
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,630
shifting power away from developers and

630
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,780
towards judges judges who in general are

631
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,160
not going to be familiar with the

632
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,730
technology or the kind of cultural or

633
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,590
social background you need to have to

634
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,690
understand how the GPL is actually

635
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,270
interpreted in the community the outcome

636
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,330
of litigation can be very bad and you

637
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,310
can get bad results and this can

638
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,370
sometimes be heavily dependent on the

639
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,650
knowledge level or skill level of the

640
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,740
lawyers on the various sides of the

641
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,040
litigation dispute so it actually you

642
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,420
know litigation tends to increase

643
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,760
uncertainty along one dimension and the

644
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,710
you know the visibility of litigation of

645
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,990
course is going to have some effect on

646
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,960
on making companies very concerned and

647
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,440
about risk and so forth my colleague

648
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Scott Peterson has has written this

649
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
interesting article that kind of relates

650
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,680
to this this concern about litigation he

651
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,810
says that open source licenses are

652
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,760
shared resources and what he means is

653
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,300
that that in in this system licenses

654
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,820
like the GPL are reused extensively from

655
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,420
project to project and that's really

656
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,010
something that makes free software and

657
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,460
open source very different from other

658
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,340
other forms of software licensing we

659
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,600
don't see this in proprietary software

660
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
licenses we don't see that that reuse of

661
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,820
standard license text and the the

662
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,240
problem with this is that when you have

663
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,120
litigation

664
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,380
the the effect of 1:1 lawsuit brought by

665
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:14,409
one litigant can be very extensive if if

666
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:16,450
the lawsuit results in a particular

667
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,919
result which may you know I you know

668
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,140
it's as likely that the results going to

669
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,580
be very bad from the perspective of

670
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,320
someone concerned about the integrity of

671
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,500
interpretation of the GPO as as it might

672
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,600
be good so so you know there's at least

673
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,169
a high risk of really bad result from

674
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,890
from a kind of community GPL perspective

675
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,779
so and and one of the problems also is

676
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,299
that if you get a bad legal result what

677
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,990
do you do then it's you can't easily so

678
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,020
these licenses are not easy to update

679
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,380
the GPL was updated three times over a

680
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,659
period of twenty five years it's not

681
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:54,490
these license are not really well

682
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,020
designed for frequent updates and so

683
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,330
you're kind of stuck with a license text

684
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,880
and a set of bad legal rulings so the

685
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,399
you know the counter-argument is that

686
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,960
litigation is potentially beneficial

687
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,090
because you get more certainty the

688
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,510
problem is that sometimes less certainty

689
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,890
is actually more beneficial because

690
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,130
because of the risk of a bad result so

691
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,220
anytime litigation is contemplated in a

692
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,960
GPL enforcement context you have to

693
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,970
consider the likelihood of a of a bad

694
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,039
result based on you know what the what

695
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,080
the facts and the legal issues are and

696
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,970
so you know what kind of follows from

697
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,620
this is that you know what's the the

698
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,649
most appropriate kind of GPL enforcement

699
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,110
case that would be brought to litigation

700
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,980
so you know it would be one where you

701
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,059
don't have strong disagreement on the

702
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,299
underlying legal interpretive issues and

703
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,610
the risk of a really bad result in terms

704
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,190
of like GPL interpretation is relatively

705
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,559
low and also these are going to be cases

706
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,169
so the intransigent aspect is that these

707
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,309
will be cases where you know education

708
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:04,450
is just not going to work you have a

709
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,990
repeat violator and so this kind of say

710
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,309
this kind of sounds to me kind of like

711
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,710
the the busybox cases that were brought

712
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,419
several years ago so I think they fit

713
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,669
well in in this kind of clear and

714
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:17,500
intransigence standard

715
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,650
I'm not so sure that that vmware lawsuit

716
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,180
really fits in well of this kind of

717
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:28,870
standard so there's there's a subtopic

718
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:35,080
here of defense of GPL claims so there

719
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,150
have been a few notable cases where

720
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,940
companies have been sued based on some

721
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,800
legal theory and they've brought a

722
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,440
counterclaim or a lawsuit against the

723
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,650
person company suing them based on an

724
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,850
allegation of GPL violation and so three

725
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,510
examples that I know of our skov II IBM

726
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,450
so schoo suit IBM many years ago IBM

727
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,280
brought a GPL violation counterclaim

728
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,780
against go Red Hat was sued by a patent

729
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,580
not a patent troll exactly but uh but a

730
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,080
company I'm sort of transitioning from

731
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,390
operating entity to patent troll called

732
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,600
Twin Peaks and Red Hat brought a

733
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,310
counterclaim based on a GPL violation

734
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,170
and another one that didn't involve the

735
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,120
GPL is Jacobsen versus cat sir where

736
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,800
cats are sue Jacobson or Jacobson's

737
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,590
company alleging patent infringement and

738
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,560
then Jacobson sued cats are alleging a

739
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,240
violation of the artistic license and

740
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,110
this resulted in a helpful legal ruling

741
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,510
in the u.s. that that open-source

742
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,980
licenses suggesting open-source licenses

743
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,380
can be enforced through copyright law

744
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,380
but notice that the the lower court

745
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,880
decision in Jacobsen be cat sir went the

746
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,160
other way and so if if the the appellate

747
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,660
court had gone the other way and agreed

748
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,250
at the lower court we would have had one

749
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,500
of those really bad cases and you know

750
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,970
several years ago this is what many of

751
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,460
us were worried about so we were kind of

752
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,210
lucky with Jacobsen beef hats are anyway

753
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,330
so so with defense of GPL claims we

754
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,950
think these should be subject to a

755
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,020
different kind of standard because they

756
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,429
don't really raise the same kinds of

757
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:15,030
concerns that that typical GPO

758
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,710
enforcement claims and litigation will

759
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,360
raise so there isn't the same concern

760
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,889
about about abuse there's no real notion

761
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,418
of doing this for financial gain these

762
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,159
are done because you've been sued by

763
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,629
some company and you want to stop the

764
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:31,370
lawsuit this is not a matter

765
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,690
the GPL litigant trying to find targets

766
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,670
to sue because the the the target is

767
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,889
already selected itself because the

768
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,280
target has brought a lawsuit against the

769
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,260
defendant and these these cases the ones

770
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,480
that have occurred in in the real world

771
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,580
so far have all involved some kind of

772
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,260
legal threat to free software so patent

773
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,820
infringement against free software

774
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,900
codebase in two of the cases and then in

775
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,610
the case of Cisco a you know a very

776
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,210
broad sort of dangerous copyright

777
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,180
infringement violation basically so so

778
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,590
defense of GPL things we think don't

779
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,720
raise raise the same concerns introduced

780
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,940
kind of viewed by a kind of lower

781
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,540
standard

782
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,690
I think Bradley Koon is has spoken

783
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,370
otherwise he's kind of criticized Red

784
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,170
Hat for having settled with Twin Peaks

785
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,060
but but I think that the you know the

786
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,700
the the way litigation works is it kind

787
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,980
of motivates you to compromise and and

788
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,780
settlement and I think it's kind of to

789
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,160
set the Bradley was sort suggesting that

790
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,750
that you should sort of fight to the

791
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,150
bitter end and make sure that you're

792
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,410
gonna bring one of these counterclaims

793
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,720
make sure that you fight to the very end

794
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,760
so that you win that I think that that's

795
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,130
just not really a realistic view of how

796
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,290
the litigation system works but again as

797
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,650
I say the the concerns that arise with

798
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,040
[Music]

799
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,120
non-defensive GPL claims don't really

800
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,750
rise in that context so that was sort of

801
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,240
the the the framework the tentative

802
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,470
framework that we've been talking about

803
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,150
very kind of rough as you can see but

804
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,890
it's but you can see that we're sort of

805
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,250
building upon the ideas that Conservancy

806
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,680
started to talk about and thinking about

807
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,240
you know what what is Conservancy

808
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,750
overlooking what are some some issues

809
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,970
that really need to be brought to the

810
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,310
fore when thinking about when GPL

811
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,750
enforcement is appropriate when

812
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,910
litigation is appropriate or not there's

813
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,160
a few other issues that I've thought

814
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,280
about that relate to this a little bit

815
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,320
in more or less direct or indirect ways

816
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,200
and I'll just in the remaining time I

817
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,640
have I will talk about those so one

818
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,380
thing is this I call this back travels

819
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,260
problem so so one of the problems I see

820
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,130
in the current state of affairs is that

821
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,720
we have different entities that are

822
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,300
concerned about GPL enforcement they

823
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,170
aren't all really talking to each other

824
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,670
fully so we have these these

825
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,410
opportunities for companies to talk to

826
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,730
each other about you know concerns about

827
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,860
McCarty and how to think about GPL

828
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,670
compliance but the these these forums

829
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,700
are not really open to all stakeholders

830
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,110
in the in the GPL Forsman world so I

831
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,460
think that we should move away from this

832
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,180
tendency to have these closed forums

833
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,150
that are not open to everyone and I'd

834
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,960
like to see us have a more multilateral

835
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,870
kind of dialogue on these issues and I

836
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,610
think not having that multilateralism

837
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,780
tends to just escalate the divisive miss

838
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,840
that surrounds this whole topic I also

839
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,110
think that some of the rhetoric that I

840
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,360
hear from Conservancy around GPL

841
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,770
enforcement is maybe also problematic in

842
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,880
some ways the rhetoric which I mean I've

843
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,740
got kind of engaged in it myself in this

844
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,870
talk a little bit is kind of aggressive

845
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,880
and almost kind of violent in nature so

846
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,970
so the the very term enforcement is sort

847
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,100
of suggestive of force violent force and

848
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,710
I don't I mean apart from compliance I

849
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,840
don't have a good alternative phrasing

850
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,210
to use but but I think there's something

851
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,040
to be said for thinking about about

852
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,660
rhetoric and I don't want to sound like

853
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,040
tone police but but I think possibly the

854
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,900
the divisive nough surround this whole

855
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,780
topic could be improved by thinking more

856
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,940
about how you know the kind of language

857
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,720
we use well so Ted show has raised an

858
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,770
interesting issue of like who should

859
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,390
really have the authority to enforce we

860
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,680
have a product like the clinic's kernel

861
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,370
with lots of copyright holders you know

862
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,230
is it really appropriate for a

863
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,030
representative of a minority of those

864
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,270
copyright holders to enforce this is I

865
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,970
think Ted suggested that maybe leanness

866
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,490
should be the one to to make the

867
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,720
decisions because that after all he

868
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,430
ultimately makes decisions for what goes

869
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:58,760
into

870
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,230
Linux kernel I don't think leanness is

871
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,390
interested in doing that but I do think

872
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,800
that that you know we knew how a project

873
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,850
like the kernel you have lots of

874
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,260
corporate copyright holders as well as

875
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,300
individual copyright holders the the

876
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,380
corporate copyright holders are

877
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,910
stakeholders as well and they ought to

878
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,660
have some some sort of say in how

879
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,130
enforcement gets done I don't really

880
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,960
have a good idea for how that can be

881
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,780
done but I can envision some more

882
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,940
multilateral way of dealing with this

883
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,020
when you first had this dev room the

884
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,210
week - Olli gave this talk about

885
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,090
basically saying that it is possible for

886
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,460
for companies to enforce the GPL without

887
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,940
being corrupt I actually I'm not sure I

888
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,440
agree with what he said in that talk

889
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,040
entirely because I think that when

890
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,050
individual companies bring GPL

891
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,310
litigation it's sort of inherently

892
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,370
suspect but maybe there's a way of

893
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,780
multilaterally addressing the GPL down

894
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,720
compliance problem involving companies

895
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,420
and I think I'll just close on this this

896
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,880
point that I think one you know one of

897
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,920
the concerns we have about we hear about

898
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,300
the McCarty lawsuit is that he's

899
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,640
bringing he's alleging very frivolous or

900
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,840
questionable interpretation of the GPL

901
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,640
that are inconsistent with how I would

902
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,430
say we we tend to assume the GPL should

903
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,140
be interpreted in in the community and

904
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,720
so maybe we can address that by having

905
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,480
projects do more of an effort than they

906
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,790
do today of documenting how they

907
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,710
interpret the GPL has applied it to the

908
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,450
issues that arise in a given project so

909
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,730
so maybe we could have the kernel start

910
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,600
to put down on paper an attempt to kind

911
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,370
of derive some kind of consensus view on

912
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,410
you know for example the proprietary

913
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,720
kernel module issue or or any number of

914
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,200
other issues that can arise in GPL

915
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,610
enforcement issues in or GPL compliance

916
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,460
is used in the kernel context so I don't

917
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,780
know there's time left for questions but

918
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm going to end it there

919
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,479
[Applause]

920
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:02,999
check we do have a couple of minutes for

921
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:05,759
questions and I'm gonna start so Richard

922
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,919
you've mentioned a number of things that

923
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,229
kind of go beyond concerns these

924
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:12,809
principles of GPL enforcement and you've

925
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,589
made a personal statement that Red Hat

926
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:19,949
is actively thinking about that so my

927
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,829
question for you is what do you kind of

928
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,949
envision that this is a a trendy want to

929
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,299
be a model do you want red hat to sort

930
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:28,890
of set the tone that maybe other

931
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,709
companies will actively think about this

932
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,660
and come up with their own principles of

933
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,969
GPL enforcement I think I'm not done do

934
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,029
you think that we're going to have

935
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,009
Oracle principles for GPL enforcement

936
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:43,140
and IBM principles of GPL enforcement

937
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,059
sort of like we had vanity open-source

938
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:46,849
licenses back in the day or

939
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:49,289
alternatively is it are you making a

940
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:51,119
call for the community to come together

941
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,079
and harmonize around principles for

942
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,880
cheapy law enforcement yeah it's it's

943
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,380
the latter of course we don't want each

944
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,519
company to come up with his own

945
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,650
principles we want to have we actually

946
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,109
want to have the whole community come

947
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:06,630
together and agree on what those

948
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,079
principles would be so Richard you

949
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,029
talked about it being important in your

950
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,089
view as I understand it for

951
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:16,739
organizations doing GPL enforcement to

952
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,719
provide clarity and transparency in

953
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,209
terms of things like who will get sued

954
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:23,099
you know and to make sure that that

955
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,719
decision is not capricious or arbitrary

956
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,449
I can understand the value of that but

957
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,219
surely the difficulty is then that you

958
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,900
end up with the whole I don't have to

959
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,249
run faster than the why and I just have

960
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,229
to run faster than new thing where every

961
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:36,329
company brings themselves into kind of

962
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:39,059
minimalist compliance just beyond the

963
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,589
next worst company in the list according

964
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:42,630
to the principles such that somebody

965
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,449
else will get sued apart from them and

966
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:46,229
whereas normally you would negotiate

967
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:47,609
with a company saying we would like full

968
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,459
compliance please they would just say go

969
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:51,779
well as long as we're doing better than

970
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,069
so-and-so your principles say you're

971
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:56,119
going to see them and not us okay

972
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,880
I don't yeah I'll have to think about

973
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,839
that

974
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,089
no problem

975
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:05,829
so I hope I can be adults with two

976
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:07,089
questions and she mentioned me I think

977
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:11,229
23 times during a talk sorry no photos

978
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:13,059
of you I was I was in the back now I

979
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,420
could hear the whole thing so so first

980
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,009
of all you youyou claim that the defense

981
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,499
of lawsuit against Twin Peaks meets your

982
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:23,739
lower class P principles in fact I think

983
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,140
it doesn't on every count it was not

984
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,239
transparent there was no discussion with

985
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,819
the community about what you were doing

986
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,410
it was not predictable because as a

987
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,150
complete surprise in the end of that

988
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,039
lawsuit or I'd had executive declared

989
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,469
that proprietary kernel modules are not

990
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:42,099
required to be under GPL and I suppose

991
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,709
it resolved yeah it's I mean it's in its

992
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:45,849
own archive.org you can read the

993
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:49,749
deposition I would assume you have so

994
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:52,359
I'm sort of sort of completely confused

995
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:55,390
about your argument that that

996
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,939
oh that basically you're the only law

997
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,289
that you said fit your principles is

998
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:01,660
basically red hats one against twenty so

999
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,130
so maybe I didn't explain this one up

1000
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,130
I'm saying that these defensive

1001
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,359
counterclaim issues shouldn't be held to

1002
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,299
the same standard so so to some degree I

1003
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,650
guess you're right about you know that

1004
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,489
the point you're making about

1005
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,499
transparency for example it doesn't meet

1006
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:16,449
the same standard of transparency that

1007
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:18,759
I'm suggesting should be part of how we

1008
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,439
think about you know GPL enforcement

1009
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:21,699
should be done but I'm saying that's

1010
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,059
okay because it slits a confined issue

1011
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:27,489
it's it's the the defense of its because

1012
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:28,989
its defensive in nature it doesn't raise

1013
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,150
the same kinds of concerns about about

1014
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,609
abuse and so forth that arise in a non

1015
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,539
defensive context so my second question

1016
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,609
is is you you just answered Tom's

1017
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:41,109
question saying yes you want to engage

1018
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:42,880
in the process of discussing and

1019
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,249
principles in a way there has been

1020
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,170
multiple forms available since the

1021
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,759
principles are published to do that I

1022
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:50,439
haven't seen you or Red Hat do that

1023
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,630
instead we have a surprise talk where

1024
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,039
you criticize everything about our

1025
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,689
principles and didn't even tell us you

1026
00:44:55,689 --> 00:44:57,489
were going to do that so so the little

1027
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,380
confused like why why why you're saying

1028
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,670
you want to have discussion but you

1029
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,259
aren't engaging in the forms that exist

1030
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:04,539
there public and transparent to discuss

1031
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,209
the principle my view is I think it

1032
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,559
would be a great idea for Red Hat to

1033
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:10,179
participate in development of the

1034
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:11,859
principle so evolution of the principles

1035
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,420
going forward I don't know if that's

1036
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,150
that's of my own

1037
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,109
personal view I don't know if that's a

1038
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:18,920
view of like some of my colleagues but I

1039
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,480
don't think it's a surprise talk because

1040
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,089
you were one of the people who voted to

1041
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,890
have it in the Dever I'm sorry time for

1042
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:35,630
one really great question if you how

1043
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,390
much do you think the SEO lawsuits of

1044
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,000
done reputational damage to this whole

1045
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,770
field of GPL including gpo litigation

1046
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,569
and in how much because this is kind of

1047
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:49,039
something I missed in your presentation

1048
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,960
what are you gonna do to kind of take

1049
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,210
away that negative feeling that those

1050
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,130
lawsuits have given to the whole field

1051
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,210
of village legislation enforcement well

1052
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,400
I I don't I mean the Skoll lawsuits are

1053
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,440
now kind of really like deeply in the

1054
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,180
past I think we've got so at the time

1055
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,039
there was a lot of concern about about

1056
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,349
whether you know free software was

1057
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,730
legally dangerous but that that was a

1058
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,099
long time ago and I think everyone kind

1059
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:15,410
of got beyond that the Cisco lawsuits

1060
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,750
were seen to be ultimately you know

1061
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,640
essentially frivolous in nature and so

1062
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,230
III don't think that that's an issue

1063
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,109
anymore okay great thank you very much

1064
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:26,288
Richard

1065
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,330
you
