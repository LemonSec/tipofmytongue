1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,370
all right so the last conference of

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,859
rosacea never met yes so we all want the

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,000
centralization this is uh this has been

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,139
this has been relatively clear the last

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,470
this day and so yeah let's talk about

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,730
the centralization so this is you right

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,340
now and this will be you after this

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,349
conference obviously well you sure do

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,360
yeah I mean do I have to to present no

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,420
it's like no is I'm here to present in

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,370
objects and not not really myself

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,340
so everyone wants a server there is a

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,070
problem with technical I mean there are

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,370
technical issues in getting servers to

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,699
everyone is literally like the I mean

16
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,649
the technical part it's really hard so

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,780
we need something for everyone to use we

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,319
need something that is also like oh no

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,360
that's not the the right the right thing

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,280
so we need something yeah we need

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,850
something that is able to be used by

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,610
anyone and that's that's a very very

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,780
tough point to to address and we also

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,340
quite want when we have servers at home

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,159
we also quite want natural networks so

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,780
that's why this slide but it's just

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,240
because it's Switzerland so we also need

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,970
need a server to be hackable because we

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,680
don't want to I mean as developers we

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,150
don't want to close like by with

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,159
interfaces like we don't want to close

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,049
users into some interfaces that they

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,759
won't be able to hack and modify and

34
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,299
extend we need to document our things

35
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,320
and we need a good community support as

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,600
well so in this to address this issue we

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,820
with the way most development in and the

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,200
fare fdn Federation we've created we've

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,440
created the Internet cube so this work

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,370
this thing and it's actually a a server

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,920
that you plug at home so it has like one

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,860
Ethernet spot that you you plug so on

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,700
your current Rooter you plug you forget

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,790
it to a power source that there can be a

45
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,700
battery as well and then it runs a

46
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,810
server at your place it's supposed to be

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,140
used friendly as well we'll see we see

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,020
how it goes and and it hosts so we are

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,270
basically if you've been there for the

50
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,700
when you noticed part since it's it's

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,230
winos running on it

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,630
you can host like pretty much everything

53
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,330
you emails your files instant messaging

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,610
web sites blogs forums it's it's yeah it

55
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,120
tell those it enables you to sync it

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,330
synchronize your calendars contacts even

57
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,040
like code repositories I mean it's set

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,550
right software and you can plug it

59
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,070
everywhere so at home it works it should

60
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,140
be working on any kind of network

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,670
actually and it's broadcasts network

62
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,850
network from your your natural internet

63
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,140
supply provider service provider so how

64
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,950
does it work a bit more technical part

65
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,739
so basically it runs a you yeah you plug

66
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,769
it and you have you plug it and you just

67
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,269
have like when you know is popping out

68
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,130
on a domain name that you've been chosen

69
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,799
and it's magic

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,219
so it works with tubes so it works with

71
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,510
a VPN actually there is starting

72
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,900
automatically on the on the device so

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,939
that's why this cat is getting out of

74
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,440
the tube because it's basically how you

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,720
get out of private networks government

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,709
stuff it means you cannot really ask

77
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,150
everyone to open ports on the router

78
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,110
days often very very yeah very hard to

79
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,660
manipulate into cough year so we're

80
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,800
using VPN to to get out and to to put an

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,090
IP and domain name on the on the on the

82
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,880
box itself and so yeah p.m. and this is

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,610
also why we are broadcasting it

84
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,099
broadcasts as well with the Wi-Fi

85
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,910
antenna broadcast the neutral network

86
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,720
because because the the VPN connects

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,919
automatically to to another ISP that is

88
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,599
local and and friendly so it's it

89
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:10,710
bypasses your local ISP and in bypasses

90
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,440
your commercial ISP and gets to some

91
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,949
some ISP that you can trust who is

92
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,050
providing you with the VPN connection so

93
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,620
why is this a good idea to actually get

94
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,669
a server plus a localized speeds because

95
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,440
you want to have your data at home and

96
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,979
you also want you also want to avoid

97
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,970
being shackled by your ISP you also want

98
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,650
to be to be able to I mean to trust the

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,830
the your network providers so that's why

100
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,719
the internet cube is is interesting is

101
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,729
because it gives you free and natural

102
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,380
network I mean it gives you natural

103
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,699
networks and and an open AdWords server

104
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,800
that is running with free software's at

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,320
home with your data in a place you

106
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,460
control so yeah that's about it I don't

107
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,380
remember my slides there oh yeah how to

108
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,750
get it

109
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,800
so in order to

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,069
in 10 a cube you need to you need to ask

111
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,250
one of your one of your one of your

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,680
local internet service provider and they

113
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,400
are located I mean not all of them are

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,050
actually providing internet cubes but

115
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,169
this is this is a map of like friendly

116
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,690
Internet service providers that you may

117
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,080
ask like if they can provide you with

118
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,740
those boxes

119
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,650
and and the reason why you need to the

120
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,770
reason why you need to to ask a provider

121
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,440
is because it's a self it's a self

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,690
configured thing so the the provider

123
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,310
will configure it for you

124
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,770
and then you will just have to plug it

125
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,840
at home and then it were it runs

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,110
automatically but if you want since all

127
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,440
the all the components are free and open

128
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,219
so you can build it by yourself yeah

129
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,550
this is just like latest news and so

130
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,050
yeah you can also build it by yourself

131
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,550
the only thing is we wanted to achieve

132
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,419
the point where the user I just had just

133
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,090
needs to plug it and then it works so

134
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,990
that's why we're we are dealing with

135
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,690
local organizations are providing you

136
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,150
with this but of course so it's an

137
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,840
Olympics Hardware board it burns when

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
you know us on it so if you know how to

139
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,069
install a Debian way you know hosts on

140
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,259
on a hardware like this you may you

141
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,949
might as well get yourself one just just

142
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:55,969
by buying it directly on their websites

143
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:02,580
so that's about it actually so those are

144
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,620
the yeah all the links you might want to

145
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,409
see so DBF fdn was the map this map is

146
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,630
something you can find on DBF fdn the

147
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,349
org and it's the the map with all the

148
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,520
local local organizations are

149
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,620
distributing that might distribute

150
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,800
in ten cube of course I forgot to say

151
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,690
that level you can tell it is the the

152
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,240
French name of the internet cube so you

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,460
can get a lot of references of level

154
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,720
internet which is exactly the same thing

155
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,120
winos dog of you of course this is the

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,550
bug tracker that you you want if you

157
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,770
want to report a bug on how it works it

158
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,980
has a part for like the specific the

159
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,580
things specific specific to the antenna

160
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,620
cube you have all the like the way we

161
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,630
are generating images for the board and

162
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,210
everything is located on github as well

163
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,360
there is a mailing list and an IRC

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,110
channel as well and I think that's about

165
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:28,680
it yes do you have some questions it's

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:52,200
been very clear the ISP was sorry yeah

167
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,440
so should you trust should one trust the

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,950
ISP or more than the box itself or who

169
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,500
should we twist well it depends on your

170
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,860
ISP like if it's like we are working

171
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,480
exclusively with like nonprofit

172
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,670
nonprofit organizations I mean these are

173
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,480
like associations so it's like it's

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,670
those are persons that you can trust but

175
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,620
the the the email server is real is

176
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,860
running literally that like on this so

177
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,610
now how trustable is it it's just like

178
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,950
it's a free software made by volunteers

179
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,550
and we try to like ensure that the

180
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,160
security is always like a

181
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,089
stream related length always always a on

182
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,139
top so it's your call but it's free

183
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:46,560
software

184
00:10:46,560 --> 00:11:03,540
kunzite is yes yeah yes yeah so can one

185
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,879
see the configurations made on the box

186
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,850
by the ISP yes everything is configured

187
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,339
like the standard way why you know hosts

188
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,160
is configuring so it's a it's really

189
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,139
like this the exact same thing and

190
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,240
things available in the way you know

191
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,639
host github and like all the

192
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,589
configurations templates and stuff they

193
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:37,529
are all located there so is there a

194
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,970
version with tours that of the VPN

195
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,970
there's not but you can you can hack it

196
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,829
to install like yeah you can do it by

197
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,420
yourself but there is no pre-configured

198
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,959
to work

199
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,120
you mean is it plan to as sorry oh yeah

200
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,630
it's a ploy

201
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,400
so is it plan to have an automated tour

202
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,700
also tour services running on this I I

203
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,880
remember someone having done a tour

204
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,970
application on the for why you know host

205
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,500
so you can that you can install on this

206
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,360
for example so that would that will host

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,339
like onion services but yeah I'm not I'm

208
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,170
not sure if this implication is still is

209
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,839
still very maintained so yeah no it's it

210
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,430
has to be done manually and it's not

211
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,880
planned for us to do so yeah it has a

212
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,970
lot of other concerns as as well so yeah

213
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,020
it's not fun

214
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:52,089
yet so can one plug an external hard

215
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,230
drive yes you can plug like in SATA you

216
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,110
can plug a set a standard hard drive on

217
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,490
it and yeah and it's there is no

218
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,040
interface that just boots on the SATA

219
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,700
disk instead of the the SD card which is

220
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,800
the the one containing the system by

221
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,010
default but it's pretty much is fairly

222
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:23,130
easy to you to do so and oh sorry

223
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,560
yeah so where can one choose where the

224
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,339
VPN is getting out in the unit this so

225
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,310
it's related to your friendly ISP that

226
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,790
you will get to so one of those guys on

227
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,510
the map I mean one of those points on

228
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,230
the map

229
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,950
so there are ISPs organizations they own

230
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,190
servers somewhere example a in the tree

231
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,890
net which is like the the local Belgian

232
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,550
ISP we own a server in the Netherlands

233
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,510
so we will assign you an IP and you will

234
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:16,830
get out on the Netherlands then you will

235
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,529
have to find another ISP to to get out

236
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,279
from another point yeah you can you can

237
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,360
choose and you can change the

238
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,890
configuration of the pin quite easily

239
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,830
[Music]

240
00:14:49,790 --> 00:15:04,160
risk I have no clue when it is okay okay

241
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,750
down to chip level okay so like like

242
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,040
yeah so is it is would it be compatible

243
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,950
with chip five hardware or is it okay so

244
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,870
is it a certification or is it like a

245
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:26,160
chip a special specific so as long as

246
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,959
Debian can run on it why you know host

247
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,870
and you can base this on it as well

248
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,640
because this runs literally on Debian

249
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,010
it's a very thin layer that you just add

250
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,850
most of the

251
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,650
the applications they are just like

252
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,990
web-based so you don't you don't need

253
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,720
much more than Debian and nginx and all

254
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:55,900
the things to to run on it so yes so is

255
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,580
it dangerous to store the data on insta

256
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,010
code it is fairly dangerous yes it's

257
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,560
much much more dangerous for your dad

258
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,080
and then Google servers that's for sure

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,570
that's also why we're trying to improve

260
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,560
the backup system because you might want

261
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,750
to back up here and there like to your

262
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,610
friends or other internet cubes but also

263
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,250
you can plug a hard drive on it so if

264
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,830
you don't trust your SD card if it's not

265
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:35,460
that reliable then sorry what rates oh

266
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,470
yeah yeah I read read discs yeah but

267
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,320
this could be a good good thing you

268
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,890
cannot plug two discs on this one

269
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,960
sorry you can okay so we confirmed it

270
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,520
works you have like multiple discs on

271
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,780
the on it

272
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,650
yeah alright I think this is it Oh

273
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,980
what kind of Wi-Fi version are we

274
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,010
supporting uh I guess like everything

275
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,140
that runs on the on this one which would

276
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,709
should be n yeah there's written n so

277
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:19,730
it's n B G I guess alright thank you

278
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,890
very much

279
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:31,339
[Applause]
