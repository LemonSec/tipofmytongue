1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,420
so our next speaker is reading a girl

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,730
and you spoke about crazy fries let's

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:25,270
upload em okay welcome everyone my name

4
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,110
is Fred

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm the maintainer of the android client

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,090
for the crazy fly quadcopter and i'm

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,469
going to talk about the crazy fly a

8
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,070
quadcopter

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,480
in the local Positioning System and

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,749
what's happening in the in the universe

11
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:42,100
of the crazy fly yeah for those of you

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,679
what who don't know what the crazy is

13
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,710
it's a tiny quadcopter you're gonna see

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,649
it later it's about the size of the palm

15
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,370
of your hand

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,030
it weighs about 27 grams flies for

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,019
roughly seven minutes and similar to how

18
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,850
do we know it's expendable with so

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,539
called Dex

20
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,170
so you have yeah kind of pin headers

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,090
then you can put stuff on top one on the

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,180
bottom it uses a bluetooth LE connection

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,680
and also proprietary radio link with 2.4

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,530
gigahertz and best of it all it's an

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,230
open-source platform it is developed by

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,960
a company called bit crazed from Sweden

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,380
and yeah they some of the decks that

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,960
they already did is for example an LED

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,420
ring or an inductive charging pad that

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,700
you can put underneath and some of the

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,990
new decks that are coming out now

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,360
for example the micro SD card deck

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,480
that's already out now it's it can be

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,230
used for logging files or for for

35
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,570
storing configuration files the firmware

36
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,560
supports fat filesystem on those microSD

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,150
cards and on the crazy on the crazy fire

38
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,860
already there's a pressure sensor so you

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,270
can do basic hover mode or altitude hold

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,130
to increase the precision there's also

41
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,878
an additional sensor deck it uses

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,069
time-of-flight and up to a range of 2

43
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,159
meters height it will be able to to be

44
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,870
much more precise and you better have

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,209
apart from the crazy fly the quadcopter

46
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,000
system with grace itself it's in kind of

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,120
an electronics company they also do

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,610
other hardware for example a little tiny

49
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,319
battery charger which can plug into USB

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,870
and you can also stack together to

51
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,920
charge multiple things at a time and

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,569
very cool thing that comes out hopefully

53
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,640
soon is still in production or a certain

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,590
kind of beta testing is the standalone

55
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,540
controller which is basically a gamepad

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,230
which includes a radio and an Arduino so

57
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,680
you can program it to not only be able

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,510
to control the crazy flight but also

59
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,640
work as a joystick or whatever you like

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,150
and it's expandable with Arduino pins

61
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,480
and so on the most exciting thing that's

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,150
hardware that's around the crazy fly is

63
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,500
the so-called local positioning system

64
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,600
and it's kind of an indoor positioning

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,290
system similar to GPS it's based on the

66
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,850
DECA wave modulation of up to 10

67
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,049
centimeters indoors and it's compared to

68
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,030
other commercial indoor positioning

69
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,760
systems that work with cameras and so on

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,549
it's roughly a hundred times cheaper so

71
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,160
it's perfect for research and

72
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,470
development and yeah much more

73
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,860
affordable and in the last year it's

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,230
become or it's it's got to the state of

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,130
early access so researchers got their

76
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,609
hands on it and the software behind it

77
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:57,049
has improved and now it supports after

78
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,690
the first ranging mode was only kind of

79
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,400
a ping pong system where ping pong yeah

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
term where it where the crazy fire

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
always sent a package to the anchors

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,570
kind of a similar to the GPS satellites

83
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,519
send them pack it out and get one back

84
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,769
and but this doesn't scale well for more

85
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,140
than a few crazy flights at a time and

86
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,039
now it is it also provides or it also

87
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,460
makes a arranging mode available that is

88
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,710
more similar to the GPS because it's

89
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,020
just passive so you can have multiple

90
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,240
crazy flies using that system without

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,610
any performance problems so because it

92
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,120
is so cheap or not sweet but affordable

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,090
and and robust the crazy fly itself and

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,530
also the inner positioning system is

95
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,750
used a lot in research projects from

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,270
different universities it's used at NASA

97
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,890
Stanford MIT Microsoft Bell Labs ETH

98
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,780
Zurich and so on I put some links in

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,140
here to see so you can check out the

100
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,990
videos on YouTube but I want to show you

101
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,650
a little show real just to - you can see

102
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:19,090
some of that stuff that's going on okay

103
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,320
[Music]

104
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,499
okay here we go

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,810
okay so that's one research at USC

106
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,370
and they use a commercial motion

107
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,170
capturing system cost

108
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,320
ruff-ruff 100,000 euros and yeah they

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,300
did some impressive work with swarms of

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,810
crazy flies

111
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,389
and they even built their logo with the

112
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,820
crazy flies USC so that's one project

113
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,590
from Stanford which combines the crazy

114
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,789
fly with a climbing robot

115
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,550
it also takes off again you can also

116
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,220
paint with crazy flies they have a

117
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,340
little brush brush at at the front it

118
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,740
takes up ink and they can see it in slow

119
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,220
motion it puts a dot under on the map

120
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,800
and paints pictures for example a teapot

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,970
so that's the result in yen that was a

122
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,280
very cool project at Maker Faire Berlin

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,220
last year we found a guy who did his own

124
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,320
lint channel and put it in we put in

125
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,720
there and this is using a MIDI

126
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,780
controlled Club glove that is able to

127
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,759
steer the crazy flight with a local

128
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,090
positioning system this is also an

129
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,610
interesting thing where they put optical

130
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,320
flow sensors on the crazy fly which

131
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,110
makes it self controlled so it

132
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,760
recognizes for example a wall and

133
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,460
doesn't crush it in crash into it and it

134
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,830
even works in pitch blackness because it

135
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,520
has infrared lights

136
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,180
so it tries to bump in there but there's

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,450
a wall under on the right side actually

138
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,890
this is a project from the inter labs in

139
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,580
Mexico where they used crazy flies to do

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,400
trajectory trajectory planning through

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:34,100
an obstacle course and also very nice

142
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,620
microsoft hololens used with augmented

143
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,280
reality and gesture control to steer

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,860
crazy fly it's on the table the right

145
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,480
and we'll lift up yeah I was one of the

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,010
most famous things is a text

147
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,440
presentation from ETH Zurich where they

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
used a similar system to the local

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,560
positioning system to also steer a lot

150
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,050
of crazy flies over a crowd at that

151
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,290
presentation okay

152
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,170
so video is nice tall but I guess you

153
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:14,380
want to see it fly so let's turn it up

154
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm just gonna ups okay I need some luck

155
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,830
for that

156
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,190
okay you go so what I'm using for that

157
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,010
is actually my Android phone with a

158
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,679
client on it and it's connected through

159
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,630
a little Dharma that's up here with

160
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,030
antenna so that's the crazy fly and

161
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,689
let's see if it works

162
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,670
okay seems to work

163
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,089
so now in recent software updates for

164
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,569
the android client it's also possible to

165
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,069
control the LED ring that you see at the

166
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,980
bottom so you can change you can switch

167
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,480
on the lights and change the pattern and

168
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,339
see if also a police mode hold on that's

169
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,009
this one so if the police is coming and

170
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,379
yeah that's no basic support for logging

171
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,819
in and parameter subsystems so you can

172
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,670
for example see the battery level on

173
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,860
your phone and we will also have some

174
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,589
support for graphs and so on in the

175
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,709
future hopefully and yeah it's basically

176
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,360
apart from being a great research

177
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,160
project it's a lot of fun to fly

178
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,399
and yeah so that's about it thanks for

179
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,309
your attention and one announcement if

180
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,360
you want to see more about the local

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,459
positioning system I highly encourage

182
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,980
you to go to a talk tomorrow at one

183
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,189
o'clock at the embedded mobile devices

184
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,699
and what's the name embedded mobile an

185
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,230
automotive deaf room

186
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,290
it's in the room UD 2.2 1 8 8 so that's

187
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,569
smaller at one o'clock and you probably

188
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:28,550
see also some crazy flies flying live

189
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,449
controlled through an indoor positioning

190
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,770
system thanks

191
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:41,309
[Applause]

192
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,840
thanks for the torque and as a small

193
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,750
token of appreciation we offer you the

194
