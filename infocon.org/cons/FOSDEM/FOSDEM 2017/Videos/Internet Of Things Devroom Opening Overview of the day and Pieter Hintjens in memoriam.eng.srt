1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,470
all right well we're adjusting the

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,469
screen I'll I'll kick off anyway it's

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,000
nice to see you Thank You room already

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,590
this early in the morning

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,780
Thanks so we are in the

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,000
internet-of-things def room great slides

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,460
are there so I'm gonna quickly introduce

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,920
myself then talk about what the IOD def

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,110
room is about then I'll quickly mention

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,960
Peter of inches but Zhu Bob is gonna do

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,500
that more explicitly and then I'll give

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,370
a short overview of the day so my name

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,770
is Maxime vest saw in electronics and am

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,460
but it's engineer and a hacker I'm

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,379
actually a firmware lead right now at

16
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,930
the IOT startup company so that's also

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:00,090
why we love the IOT environment right

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,600
I did for I am involved a few free and

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,530
open-source software projects such as

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,990
pico TCP which is a free embedded tcp/ip

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,670
stack you're going to be talks about

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,649
this today and in this room as well

23
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,719
there's also going to be a there's a

24
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,670
stand about pika TCP

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,709
I'm also working on frosted which is a

26
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:29,709
free POSIX operating system for small

27
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,380
embedded devices there's also going to

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,579
be talk about that later today and link

29
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:39,720
to froster this unique or MX which is

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,630
which is a actually a core library to

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,170
support all whole functions of

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,380
microcontrollers or of ARM arm cortex-m

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,140
0 up to m7 microcontrollers that just

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,000
briefly who I am and why I'm in this

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,610
death row then we have the Internet of

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,200
Things there Froome this is the fourth

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,539
time we're organizing this and it's it's

38
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,189
the first time I'm hosting the bathroom

39
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,310
and before me the 3 years earlier it was

40
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,440
spitting pity hench's who knows this def

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,600
room and it's because of him that that

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,829
I'm here right now and that we're all

43
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:15,400
here right now the frozen dev rooms are

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,139
hold 8 tracks as you know and they're

45
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,180
specifically focused on one topic aimed

46
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,280
at developers to hold for them as about

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,150
developers and that's why we here why

48
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,340
now the Internet of Things as how long

49
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,930
do so from the University of Cambridge

50
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,930
once set she said we have a clear vision

51
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,060
to create a world where every object

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,239
from jumbo jets to needles suing needles

53
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,069
are linked to the Internet of course

54
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,989
this has been big words that have been

55
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,599
around for a long time now but I think

56
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,400
we're slowly getting there more and more

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,959
things are getting connected there's a

58
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,940
lot of trouble with connecting many

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,700
small things also but ok these are all

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,160
challenges that we have to face that's

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
what makes this really interesting

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,500
we want to have very diverse stocks in

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,870
this death room so when I put out a call

64
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,180
for papers I ask for a few fewer things

65
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,250
like machine-to-machine communication

66
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,709
between small devices distributed

67
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,830
application autonomous or or self

68
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,310
control devices also more infrastructure

69
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,319
related maybe building on the tcp/ip

70
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,870
protocol or novelties in that that

71
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,209
domain gnash not working of course if we

72
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,120
have that many devices Message Queuing

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,849
solving real-life problems with these

74
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,430
Internet of Things solutions

75
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,230
interoperability since we have this many

76
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,540
different devices how are they going to

77
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,900
talk to each other so this makes for a

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,989
very diverse talks and maybe even talks

79
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,769
that will interact nicely with each

80
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,099
other we'll see what the day brings of

81
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,750
course all the presentations here must

82
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,180
be must be fully free and open-source

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,459
software and related to software

84
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,380
development then this is Peter Finch's

85
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,950
but since superb is going to give a way

86
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,599
better presentation about him I'll keep

87
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,819
this really brief Peter interest was a

88
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,400
was a writer a programmer a tinkerer and

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,010
I might even say a visionary he wrote

90
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,019
more than 30 protocols and this rigid

91
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,419
software you might know him from AMQP or

92
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,150
z1q from the many books he wrote they're

93
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,789
all excellent I read all of them except

94
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,930
one this one which I should read there

95
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,289
that's I just heard so I'm going to do

96
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,060
that it was the president of a

97
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,970
foundation for free information

98
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,349
infrastructure he fought for software

99
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:45,160
patents he he was in the standardization

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,710
of the Microsoft XML Office format and

101
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,470
so much more and like I said he

102
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,090
organized this deaf room for the last

103
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,160
three years and we want to keep this

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,620
this tradition going in respect to him

105
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,960
and of course because it's a great deaf

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,470
room

107
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,160
then in April 2016 he was diagnosed with

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,940
German terminal metastasis of a of his

109
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,060
previous cancer and that's why later

110
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,430
today and also still a little bit now we

111
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,190
will have a small in memoriam for people

112
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,960
paid attention so if you're interested

113
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,570
be sure to be in the NDK building at six

114
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,890
o'clock this evening but now let's

115
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,950
continue with the overview of the day so

116
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,600
just very quickly you all have the have

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,190
the booklets of course but what are we

118
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,040
going to talk about the first talk after

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,810
this is going to be about coffee

120
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,480
machines speaking bouquet or bocce I

121
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,740
don't know how to pronounce it so it's

122
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,830
about a Modbus protocol then we have a

123
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,320
demo where we are playing with lights so

124
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,110
IOT is all about connecting all kinds of

125
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,690
stuff and of course lights leds bigger

126
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,630
lights are fun to play with adam is a

127
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,880
project where they're monitoring air

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,740
quality

129
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,260
then there's the Eclipse IOT plus cloud

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,020
foundry they're building a platform

131
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,200
specifically for IOT applications then

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,530
there's 6lowpan in Pico TCP so a Pico

133
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,590
TCP is this library tcp/ip library

134
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,419
that's already there 6lowpan is one of

135
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,630
the upcoming protocols that that's

136
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,290
really focused on the IOT we have Gery

137
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,750
scripts which is a lightweight

138
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,570
JavaScript engine Yocto based iot

139
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,180
devices so we might know Yocto this

140
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,150
built environment for building for

141
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,669
building embedded devices we have the

142
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,280
frosted embedded POSIX operating system

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,320
so okay this is an operating system it's

144
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,620
POSIX but is also very much focused on

145
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,240
connectivity and and thus Internet of

146
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,720
Things what then is a bit less embedded

147
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,360
but that's ok it's about time series

148
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,190
analysis so you're gonna get a lot of

149
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,820
data out of a lot of Internet of Things

150
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,610
devices what to do with this data how to

151
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,190
represent it it's usually put into some

152
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,919
form of time series so more about that

153
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,620
in this talk we have a project

154
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,860
lighthouse we have a scientific micro

155
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,480
Python for microcontrollers

156
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,390
we have iota vt4 devices from the

157
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,580
devices to the cloud so this this is the

158
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,920
complete link and now we haven't talked

159
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,710
about the open smart grids platform so

160
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,340
this also may be a little not not so

161
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,870
small infrastructure but really smart

162
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,810
grid this is way bigger so I think it's

163
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,340
very diverse day that we're looking at

164
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,110
that's it for me I'm now handing the

165
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:48,190
words to tissue bob thanks gonna hand

166
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,550

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,860
yeah here you go

168
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,910
thanks so much so my name is Benjamin

169
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,050
Horne we know I'm Belgian as and there

170
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,220
was a good friend of Peter first time I

171
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,410
met was in 2000 in 2005 during the soft

172
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,830
patent directive Peter was running

173
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,460
company column Attucks and they were

174
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,630
threatened by a patent troll on patents

175
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,440
around

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,650
matching a telephone number and an email

177
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,170
in the database for an SMS gateway and I

178
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,210
first met him in a in a small conference

179
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,600
where our opponents were trying to break

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,000
our presentations and Peter was so

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,940
furious that he said no more slides I'm

182
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,350
going to talk about my own experience

183
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,020
and that was the best speech I've ever

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,500
saw on the topic and after that we

185
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,490
started to to work together he recruited

186
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,500
me so after my university time to be a

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,570
permanent representative of FFI the

188
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,130
organization that fought against of a

189
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,570
patents for the last since 1999 and so

190
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,220
we made that was July 2005 when the

191
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,209
directive was rejected and six months

192
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,670
afterwards when I started to work with

193
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,740
Peter the Commission announced that they

194
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,200
gonna relaunched the debate on the

195
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,529
community patents which was basically

196
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,670
the large companies saying we asked to

197
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,180
drop this directive project and push for

198
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,010
a central patent code which would give

199
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,450
the ID and the same result and we are

200
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,850
asking 12 years later and they are very

201
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,620
very close now to get what they want

202
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,410
Germany and UK with the brexit are

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,730
delaying the process but basically I'm

204
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,550
still here 12 years later trying to

205
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,880
fight it we might we are working with

206
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,320
some other people to try to stop it via

207
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,910
via constitutional complaint in Germany

208
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,150
and maybe other countries so I wanted to

209
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,580
to say that I organized together with

210
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,490
Peter the last three years of this deaf

211
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:39,880
room

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,890
I was music taking care of the video

213
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,100
streaming we Peter Peter and I worked we

214
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,680
had the chance to work with Peter last

215
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,780
year I was coming back from Switzerland

216
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,240
where I try to to move there because of

217
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,780
the mountains and the nice the nice area

218
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,150
over there didn't work out so I was

219
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,910
coming back to Belgium

220
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,890
and I was looking for a job and Peter

221
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,530
told me yeah I have this problem with

222
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,660
100 0 mq Java

223
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,100
cross-compilation I don't understand

224
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,170
anything I say yeah I do I do some

225
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,000
immediate development around open the

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,850
VRT so I said that maybe I can help you

227
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,530
to set up the the class copulation with

228
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,520
Android SDK and NDK so that was like

229
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,380
November we did we did some Simek around

230
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,100
that we did node.js bindings for 0 mq we

231
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,160
did we worked around 0 so tires is an

232
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,230
interesting protocol for the Internet of

233
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,000
Things because it doesn't go in the

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,610
cloud we try to find peers on the LAN

235
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,720
and if it's pre-configured you can find

236
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,710
friendly friendly devices like typically

237
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,600
if you have a samsung machine of samsung

238
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,060
TV and a samsung fridge if they are

239
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,470
connected to the land i will find each

240
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,990
other and we made we made some

241
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,370
interesting demo where maybe I can show

242
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,550
I can show this one first that was one

243
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,420
thing we did in February last year just

244
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,390
before Fossum and we presented the last

245
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:28,900
presentation of this dev room he he was

246
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,230
quite a good musician so he wanted to

247
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,000
export it's a MIDI keyboard so it's a

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,130
mini interface and he wanted to export

249
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,380
the the key events Suzy MQ to a laptop

250
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,440
that has the synthetizer so what we did

251
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,230
what I did was to take one of those

252
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,380
devices which are running on panda BRT

253
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,050
which has USB port and I could plug in

254
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,130
MIDI to USB converter get the device

255
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,930
detected by a MIDI stack and then taking

256
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,840
all the events from from from the from

257
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,530
the driver

258
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,020
and then type that to zoom cue

259
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,689
zyre given that we wrote so there are

260
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:22,149
three traces of that and github so if

261
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:29,889
you search for if you search for MIDI

262
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:34,230
cast on github you will find the project

263
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,869
so anybody working like the hackathon we

264
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:41,069
organized the hackathon two days before

265
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,989
before first mmq Akutan where all those

266
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,290
even queue people met and we we made

267
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,249
some progress on in different things we

268
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,410
managed to run Malamute which is the

269
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,089
broker of 0nq on this device we managed

270
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,170
to crush it as well and after that some

271
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,589
people came and fixed the fact that you

272
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,009
can limit the amount of memory that you

273
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,350
allocate to the broker on this device so

274
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,689
that was nice nice improvement so yeah

275
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,970
we made we made this distinct

276
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,100
Murphy when you try to make a demo

277
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,720
Murphy's always around and basically the

278
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,850
setup is that we were having this device

279
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,579
connected to the to the to the keyboard

280
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,249
and we had another blue central access

281
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,829
point and we said oh no it's okay we're

282
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,889
gonna connect to the first and network

283
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,439
so we connected to the foreign network

284
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,420
but it didn't work so basically it has

285
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,589
no network block block broadcast Denzel

286
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,290
since it's sending broadcast could not

287
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,629
connect to the to the other devices so

288
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:58,720
we talked we had again the joon-kyu

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,709
packet on the last two days thanks for

290
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,569
the people who joined there are some

291
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:08,309
where engagements and we talked about

292
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,619
different techniques on how to avoid if

293
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,299
the broadcast is blocked what can we do

294
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:13,779
next

295
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,869
can we maybe try to go to use other

296
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,769
mechanism like gossip or even go to 88

297
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,489
Tate's trying to find each other things

298
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:32,029
like that so that was last year

299
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:41,069
last year we also had I think the United

300
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,410
States I don't know if he's he's here

301
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,119
this year but we had we had this person

302
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,730
making presentation and he had some nice

303
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:57,269
to suitcase I think I can recognize a

304
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,920
cubieboard 1 there are some here you

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,269
have Arduino shield with all the things

306
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,139
exposed he have some Ethernet switch

307
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,089
over here multiple buttons I see I see

308
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:23,029
this Intel Intel quad based Intel Edison

309
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,410
and this is only one face there was also

310
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:34,740
the other face and the second one so in

311
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,499
terms of IOT IOT we saw the last what

312
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,149
happened is that we we organized this

313
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,999
hackathon in East garage because he had

314
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,740
the garage where we could organize

315
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,910
things we heated up the hackathon went

316
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,920
fine for them went fine and then we

317
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,129
continued to heated up to the garage and

318
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,579
that was basically became our office for

319
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,250
for like a month and a half and we were

320
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,148
preparing another demonstration of the

321
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:12,659
power so we developed something called

322
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,419
glare and glare is the demon that

323
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,659
basically runs on the device and can run

324
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,439
some commands basically it joins it

325
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,000
finds all the peers on the network on

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,898
the land and then if some of the those

327
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:30,539
know this rather node is in control mode

328
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,429
then you can send commands to the other

329
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,289
machines that are on the land

330
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:41,559
so we did we did I did some I modified

331
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,580
those devices to add a lighter bicycle

332
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,929
light and we put them together on

333
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,669
batteries and we could show for example

334
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:01,549
that they could display Morse code at

335
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,650
the same time and if you would remove

336
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,309
one node and put it back it would be

337
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,010
back in the cycle of executing commands

338
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,539
together so I'm gonna I prepared this

339
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,620
demo for IT conference in Munich where

340
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,899
he went along to make the demo so I was

341
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:25,159
really afraid of Murphy again so I will

342
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,289
prepared everything in advance and it

343
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,390
just had to play the demonstration there

344
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,409
and that was basically his last

345
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:34,789
conference because when he came back

346
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,880
from the IOT conference in Munich he was

347
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,370
really coughing a lot and I thought it

348
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,610
was because of the guard that he got a

349
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,590
cold and then I asked him to visit

350
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,460
doctor and the results from the from the

351
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,820
visit after two weeks of tests were not

352
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,500
that great and basically he came back

353
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,600
with news that he had missed a studies

354
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,390
in both lungs at the time and Peter had

355
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,309
cancer I mean he went he worked for

356
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,860
Samsung for some ITT mesh project to be

357
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,640
able to put two phones together too that

358
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,029
they could communicate in a kind of a

359
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:22,549
mesh way that was in 2009-2010 and he

360
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:27,039
came back from from South Korea

361
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,960
was basically a cancer in the in the

362
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,559
duodenum apparently had eaten some crude

363
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,289
fish with sushi sushi with crude fish

364
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,909
and apparently in this area is quite

365
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:43,580
common this kind of disease so I did it

366
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,189
to him hospital he was kind of yellow

367
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,039
and he was on chemotherapy but he

368
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,399
managed to to survive it and I think

369
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,519
from this moment in time his life

370
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,529
changed he saw that the cancer could

371
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,440
come back and basically he did for

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,480
example he decided to stop to stop

373
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,789
entirely writing cross or software

374
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,630
he said free software is the future and

375
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,010
if there is something that needs to

376
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,510
survive it's free software in the long

377
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,320
run and from that moment in time he

378
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,250
spend much more time with his kids he

379
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,139
wrote several books all the books that

380
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:31,610
he wrote are basically from from 2010 on

381
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,309
so I'm going to show you the demo that

382
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,539
we made with the small devices and that

383
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,620
we presented in Munich

384
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,790
okay I'm going to spin a little bit more

385
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,700
about how this cluster works this is a

386
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,810
tp-link wireless router it's been set up

387
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,300
runs on a battery and these lipo

388
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,180
batteries will last for about 12 hours

389
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,690
they are quite nice we don't really like

390
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,180
this is cable at the back that's still a

391
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,160
work in progress now here I have one of

392
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,460
these little guys unplugged so I'm going

393
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,220
to plug them in switch them on and you

394
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,100
will see roughly how long it takes for

395
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,380
the network to come up if you see there

396
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,630
little LED light is switched on that

397
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,680
you're looking to these the same way

398
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,110
[Music]

399
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:40,810
this is the and

400
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,290
and what we've done with these is that

401
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,950
as they start booting the LEDs will will

402
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,480
indicate but will actually have the

403
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,590
light showing the flash once every

404
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,690
second as they put up and it lasts twice

405
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,240
when they already start flashed

406
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,400
nothing's going to flash soon and ever

407
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
to a flash rather yeah so that's ready

408
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,620
now when they're ready you see on top

409
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,590
that there's a little rotating sequence

410
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,030
on the LEDs

411
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,450
that's actually the gloried 150 diamond

412
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,930
during the work that demon is a dire

413
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,380
application which connects to the Wi-Fi

414
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,280
network friends other nodes join two

415
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,980
plus three and it starts actors which

416
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,180
manage the lamp which tipped the switch

417
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,800
which - there it is

418
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,080
and that basically is ready and if I go

419
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,790
into emergency mode than any of these

420
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,850
guys then they all start blinking happy

421
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:49,220
little ponies interrupts this switches

422
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,790
off right away don't work the same way

423
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,490
so this could be anything this is now

424
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,180
just a demo of a Morse code signaling it

425
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,040
could be alarm system it could be

426
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,210
temperature sensors

427
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,380
it could be control of devices in a

428
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,160
factory so far we've been testing this

429
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,230
for about three or four days and we've

430
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,320
had no no Wi-Fi failures no issues a

431
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,720
soupy to the Wi-Fi network is

432
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,940
surprisingly powerful so there you are

433
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,270
all the source code is on github the

434
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,630
link below

435
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,819
[Music]

436
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:34,159
so that was his last demo now as soon as

437
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,950
you have one or two minutes so Peter was

438
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,099
kind of after he passed away I

439
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,049
discovered he was member of Mensa which

440
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,129
is the high IQ organization I think he

441
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,269
was very intelligent person for me it

442
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:57,889
was like one of my reference and he

443
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:01,099
published I think a week before passing

444
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,629
away he published a summary of his life

445
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:07,340
with all those software projects that he

446
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,669
went through what where he failed where

447
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:13,460
you succeeded what went well what went

448
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,669
wrong and for me this kind of a guide

449
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,169
because I think most of us are in

450
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,919
professionally are in software

451
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,539
development or in IT and you have this

452
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,220
kind of request from your boss can you

453
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,919
make this impossible I mean some kind of

454
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,129
mission mission possible and at the

455
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:37,940
beginning it was expecting anything but

456
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,710
after some time he said yeah basically

457
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,940
he could see in advance what would work

458
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,559
and what would not work so I think you

459
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,239
can learn a lot in your daily life from

460
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,960
recommendations that are in this book

461
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,159
so I before I came here to for them to

462
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,210
present the memoriam that can give at 6

463
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,149
p.m. this evening I had to go so this

464
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:11,539
book is available online for free on PDF

465
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:19,279
and epub but Peter had had but still has

466
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,779
three kids who are very young so I would

467
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,910
encourage you if you have if you have

468
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,530
[Music]

469
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,510
you basically I encourage you to buy it

470
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,490
to buy books and there's also paper

471
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,260
account if you want to donate some money

472
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,590
for the kids I think the money is going

473
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,480
to be it's going to be well used when

474
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,530
they grow up as the smallest one is five

475
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,400
years old and yeah that's a very sad

476
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,130
situation so I wanted to say thank you

477
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,970
and I hope you will get a enjoyable that

478
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,400
room thank you

479
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,099
[Applause]
