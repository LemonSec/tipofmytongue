1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,420
and also a good friend of mine and works

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,310
for a television channel a student group

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,860
called twice TV and will explain us how

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,650
it is transcoding platform based on open

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,509
source software everyone so as crystal

6
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,759
just say I work for a trace TV such a

7
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,070
group of channels as you may see here we

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,099
have like virus TV channels but music

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,598
like different kind of music we

10
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,579
specified for the different regions in

11
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,519
Africa but we have two sports channel we

12
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,120
have no radio offer and all this is

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,600
based in Paris it is a total of 24

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,269
streams now and so this presentation is

15
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,079
an emphasis on on the transmitting

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,059
really light platform we did so

17
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:57,679
basically it's just a combination of

18
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,829
like tools you probably know of course

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,620
ffmpeg etc but I really want to put the

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,740
emphasis on the interface itself and why

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,120
we why we really needed to focus on that

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,920
so it all started with that project

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,620
named trace central which was dedicated

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,590
first for production teams so it's only

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,470
query like I use this bootstrap Kingdom

26
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,840
United to do like all these people

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,620
dynamic boxes etc and lights the idea

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,780
there was that like always done in paper

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,930
like until like recently and my people

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,020
will like just enters of stuff to be

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,480
like some checked Kings on capital

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,880
letters cetera I use a tactic to try

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,770
just to normalize it with green light

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,510
red light etc and then we pushed that to

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,120
to the transcoding to the transcoding

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,750
world so basically this is just a web

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,760
server this will call Python scripts to

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,810
run a ffmpeg task at the very first the

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,600
tasks were really really simple one just

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,568
conversion aged 20 etc and we had to

41
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:11,810
modify the the song and bring it to zero

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,360
in our mixers

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,580
and then it'd be like we had to do like

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,780
audio mappings because all our

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,220
differentials like we'll have like

46
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,710
billing go French English or just

47
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,570
English or Spanish whatever and like

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,460
there was all many many combination of

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,980
audio mapping but the point is that even

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,620
if my team like the technical team could

51
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,050
do it by itself like just using ffmpeg

52
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,050
normally with the lines most of the user

53
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,940
now are almost everyone in your company

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,520
like everyone either a graphic designer

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,350
or the the schedulers whoever like even

56
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,030
people working in marketing and have no

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,560
knowledge at all video needs to

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,080
transcode by themselves video - and make

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,200
it more efficient so that's why we we

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,940
started like to do stuff that will

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,520
detect if there are like many various

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,800
source of the same files like what will

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,850
be the highest resolution available like

64
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,350
Full HD HD ready whatever and and then

65
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,180
like people like told me like I just

66
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,770
don't understand what is HD and I don't

67
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,989
want to understand what is HD then I

68
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,330
just went with old system with green

69
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,070
light red light it's good quality bad

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,360
quality it's really funny to say that

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,580
but this was a real need enough in our

72
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,290
company because people didn't want to

73
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,850
get involved with techniques needed to

74
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,500
transcribe video by themselves because

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,690
if they're to ask to my service all the

76
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,280
time a manual we need to transcribe this

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,810
for that it would take so much more time

78
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,870
than if they do it by themselves and

79
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,390
then when we offered open that Pandora

80
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,700
Boxx of course everyone used it and in a

81
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,980
virus way that were out of control and

82
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,830
and then we had to combinate it with a

83
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,820
very simple so at first it was a MongoDB

84
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,560
database but now now we just switch to

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,989
SQL I just had to have a tracking of

86
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,450
like a mini mini video were were

87
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,820
transcoding and articles from Sarris the

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,860
definition is really bad like as you can

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,360
see there were still thousands of video

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
were sorry like many views were hundreds

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,269
of video were like actually ready when I

92
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,250
want basically to have all of them in

93
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,200
full HD so that was a way for me to

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,399
track that people were still not

95
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,048
understand turns thing how to use

96
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,370
software and I to make it even more

97
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,130
simple to reach my goal which were like

98
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,680
one

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,419
and Full HD videos then then what's next

100
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:35,100
so what we want to do next is a to make

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,050
it faster to duplicate our servers and

102
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,000
to share it back with the community so

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,430
we just created a really simple simple

104
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,410
get up first for backup purposes and and

105
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,389
make it way more easy to duplicate we

106
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,870
added a pastor so this one was done not

107
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,139
yes with like this package so hola

108
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,850
well-known but like most of our

109
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,789
producers they deliver the the meta that

110
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,930
has as various various way first way to

111
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,960
do it like xlsx but like CSV and then

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,910
they will do like non-standard CSV like

113
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,590
they always think it's funny to

114
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,410
customize it and replace the punctuation

115
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,320
by like percent or whatever so each time

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,940
like you have to modify the parsers come

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,330
often

118
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,199
and so the idea was to integrate like

119
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,050
all the metadata as in a bundle and not

120
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,330
to zip it and then move it from from

121
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,810
storage one to the other to one another

122
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,789
then what is well want what I want to

123
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,199
modify right now is that all the fold

124
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,900
the network folder paths are hard-coded

125
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,750
now and before sharing it of course we

126
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,849
would like just to add a page and being

127
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,039
and people being able to enter the

128
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,380
network photo that we want to use

129
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,310
because this software is a way to to to

130
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,740
register beaut the videos after transfer

131
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,010
it to to either ready to broadcast so

132
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,620
Derek is the player station or sometimes

133
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,070
for advisory reason we need to blur like

134
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,090
whatever like alcohol or cigarettes by

135
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,919
its whatever me to do a lot of blurring

136
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,419
and there are different services

137
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,669
production services at trace who's that

138
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,830
you do only this task so it will be

139
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,840
rerouted from here to there whatever and

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,449
all this is is under controlled by the

141
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,540
software so as soon as the

142
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,040
this will be done I think we'll be able

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,290
to share it because then it won't be

144
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,330
just internal software dedicated for

145
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,280
trades but it could be like we easy for

146
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,350
people to towards this web server all in

147
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,750
place and use it so of course when when

148
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,570
we created that software what I had in

149
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,530
mind was this commercial software named

150
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,970
Calcutta by harmonic and they have like

151
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,970
their farm name wfs so of course it's

152
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,160
way is far from this project which is

153
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,960
way more than than my my transmit

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,700
platform of course but it is an open

155
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,760
source and I think easy it's way easier

156
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,120
to modify to to minified these two units

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,010
so I think I went kind of fast because

158
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,280
that's what so I don't know if you guys

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
have any question or if you want some on

160
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,380
today's and like our production

161
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:32,320
workflows or whatever yes right no

162
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,350
thanks they don't like so yes I read the

163
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,270
question was like do do the producer

164
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,530
provide like correct time except

165
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,360
directly and their answer of course is

166
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,690
no we have 20 production centers in the

167
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,330
world and of course I will even though

168
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,790
since hinge 8 years I'm trying to say

169
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,610
please provide me a mix FX becomes I can

170
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,130
do it yeah so I've always a very a

171
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,260
variety of forma which are really badly

172
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,690
done well the biggest problem I have is

173
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,240
like they never respect the the frame

174
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,460
rate like I would have like they will

175
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,290
invent frame rate which is kind of funny

176
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,970
like because they think it is when you

177
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,800
have to enter the frame rate like they

178
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,110
think it's ask to them on toast number

179
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,090
you want and say will put like 11 and we

180
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,930
have to get it back over to 222 FPS or I

181
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,420
don't know whatever various woman and

182
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,340
it's too late because what just know is

183
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,130
that most of the videos produced for

184
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,120
example in Nigeria

185
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,390
ninja is a huge production city they

186
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,950
have like like you may have heard of

187
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,140
Bollywood they have Nollywood like

188
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,490
Nigeria

189
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,279
the core prediction and like the company

190
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,770
producer content like they will have a

191
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,969
six months lifetime

192
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,589
and then they closed and people do

193
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,570
another job so of course like you have

194
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,480
like this rush in 22 fps and they

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,940
deleted everything and you you are just

196
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,339
have that and you need to make it like a

197
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,140
25 fps and exceptions they come out of

198
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,560
it so this is the lot we have this very

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,860
very often then much more classical it's

200
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,180
like all the content that come from the

201
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,680
US and then there will be a there will

202
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,649
be 29 the 97 fps and we have to just

203
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,339
bring it back to 25 but the same I could

204
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,380
go through the open source community we

205
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,270
find a way to make it properly I think

206
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,640
with like more subtle parameters to have

207
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,980
the lip-sync work perfectly on this

208
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,620
modification ferment modifications so

209
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,690
now like I receive like a huge amount of

210
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:37,540
formats no for the moment out sorry the

211
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,709
question was like either the

212
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,540
transmitting distributed like multi

213
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,550
thread or whatever now I mean we're just

214
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,529
playing with the the military strength

215
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,440
parameter in ffmpeg of course to all our

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,709
course used but no it is not like a form

217
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,730
right now at the same time what we try

218
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,180
to do is we have we have a VMware

219
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,170
cluster and we created really small

220
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,089
virtual machines for each transcoding

221
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,180
units because if you split by all the

222
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,920
different services like there would be

223
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,690
really small needs there are a lot of

224
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,029
needs on the global if you look in

225
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,620
global which is always like little needs

226
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,120
transmitting here and there so we don't

227
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,010
need to put like crazy performing

228
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,040
servers for for them so in no way it's

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,690
just it's a description that word for

230
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,060
trace but it's not distributed as you

231
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,950
said I should just ask oh yes you're

232
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,010
right

233
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:42,860
between so you have some mediums as I

234
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,899
said other question was like how do I

235
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,329
distributed transmen if I have like big

236
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,640
jobs to transport or smaller ones for

237
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,430
the moment it's just a lot of small ones

238
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,200
and for example like when we have movies

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,140
which is brand new for us because Trey

240
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,200
started to do as VOD just last year so

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,730
for first time we have movies where as I

242
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,290
said we are a music channel so our

243
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,730
programs are never longer than 15

244
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,950
minutes but then when you go on movies

245
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,019
like we went to transcode a long movie

246
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,959
we will always ask for example to to our

247
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,060
partners in in England with also

248
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,490
subtyping and voiceover 2 to 3

249
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,839
transcoded because they are doing like

250
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,790
the voice-over so right now we didn't

251
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:32,810
have that he is the the it's the

252
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,269
question was with the key customer of

253
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,339
this kind of torture and tourney and it

254
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:38,839
would be anyone in the company really

255
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,850
because like the idea is easy to the key

256
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,230
word for in our company since 2 years

257
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,420
now is like digital digitalized company

258
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,550
whatever and I really and first like

259
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,810
they were really proud of like our

260
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,149
editors being able to shoot and edit but

261
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,529
news I have to shoot edit and transcode

262
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,910
and like know even like marketing

263
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,829
people's need to transcode themselves of

264
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,870
videos so everyone need to transcode and

265
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,630
that's why we like when i explain like

266
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,190
everyone is using it and i try to make

267
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,019
this really easy word to understand what

268
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,490
they were doing at least kind of

269
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,500
properly the biggest user yeah

270
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,350
the biggest winner will be equally

271
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,880
equally the editors of course for the in

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,060
the broadcast team but all the con

273
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,399
how do you say that like the community

274
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,640
managers in the digital platforms on the

275
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,399
website etc like that we need to take

276
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,829
our broadcast content and do like some

277
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:35,649
mpeg-4 versions for the website so

278
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,260
we did you mean we don't use it just

279
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,029
internally for the moment we don't have

280
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,360
customers man my goal is to share it now

281
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,279
open source of course but but we don't

282
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,839
look at it just an internal software for

283
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:04,250
the moment so the competitors of you you

284
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,480
want to know who are the computers of

285
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,160
Crestview or the computers of trace TV

286
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,660
you'll be complicated like if we talk

287
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,580
about digital as Julie will be Netflix

288
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,170
even though we are way smaller than them

289
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,589
and and on the broadcast it is kind of

290
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,140
we are kind of singular as we are a

291
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,420
French international company we are like

292
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,570
in 120 countries over 30 satellite and

293
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,580
and we are small company still we are

294
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,480
200 people so I would say we don't have

295
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,680
exactly the same kind of competitors

296
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,020
Antilles way bigger than us why it would

297
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,940
be the same business I did on MTV but

298
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,640
with like a tenth of their of their team

299
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
now

300
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,080
thanks everyone

301
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,840
oh sorry yeah yes nope

302
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,440
[Applause]
