3
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:06,520
because it goes with TCP because two

4
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:16,050
devices in contrast to some it's

5
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,340
protocol to understand and to implement

6
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,650
and that's what makes it so interesting

7
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,420
in my opinion we could actually say

8
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,850
support from diabetes and three

9
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,850

[Music]

14
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,709
and something it was something that

15
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,040
pretty much the same ischemia MIDI

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,570
allowing you to mount virtually and just

17
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,120
five years ago and he pasts maintenance

18
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:00,910
onto two different people uses for the

19
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,340
next few years I just fixed minor bugs

20
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:13,300
and try to get to something useful for

21
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,110
them because they didn't use and they

22
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,720
were swapping to original universe was

23
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,110
written for that so it was interesting

24
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,269
because before that I all we had was

25
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,370
right and wheat and that was it you can

26
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,550
do

27
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,989
few years later we named experts before

28
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,959
the main exports you could and if you

29
00:03:41,959 --> 00:04:19,500
have to open so you can just discard

30
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:32,610
from this we which is very useful if

31
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,720
you're trying to implement the file

32
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
system on top of Mt

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,680
etc etc so the guys came back to me and

34
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,520
said look we want to do some version

35
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,660
where if you connect to the port or you

36
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,910
connect with four reasons or come back

37
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:10,229
you just guys in 2015 and this will

38
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,720
actually first time particular feature

39
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
was implemented into another and the

40
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
implementation

41
00:05:18,780 --> 00:07:06,610
that was I has been market space MVD is

42
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,250
not ice QC it is not enterprise son

43
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,159
it is CC will use solution for son it

44
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,599
will not be added to that son

45
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,129
it is useful it's free and open source

46
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,750
environment its

47
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,380
under

48

[Music]

49
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,360
HPA driver the NPD driver itself is just

50
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:27,880
that md extraction and i scusi and the

51
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,669
type of commands you would send over MD

52
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,419
are much simpler in general than the I

53
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,479
scusi one's heart where I scooted surfer

54
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,680
we just attached disks and allows you to

55
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,780
access those discs over the network it's

56
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:55,430
easier than an MP's actually

57
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,230
a little more in-depth comparison

58
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,170
between the protocol document that

59
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:15,110
describes how I can show you in a moment

60
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,779
itself contains what I mean with Alice

61
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,660
if you type protocol from top to bottom

62
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,070
you know everything there is to know

63
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,880
about the MBE protocol there now I've

64
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,500
seen that describes how ice cruising

65
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,450
works its RFC 71-43

66
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,910
[Music]

67
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:43,490
it is 295 pages I don't think there's I

68
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,180
try to look at the spec it's just huge

69
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,000
and impossible to read it's extremely

70
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:13,490
protocols its protocols to use device

71
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,709
essentially for every a block device is

72
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,180
a device that allows you to read and

73
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,690
drives particular blocks of a given

74
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,970
length at a given F set and that's it we

75
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,610
don't do much more than that with my

76
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,230
screwsie it's just a layer that's in a

77
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,000
scusi system a nice cozy device and

78
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,640
directly be used in a nice cozy

79
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,360
environment

80
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,269
[Music]

81
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:40,279
[Music]

82
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,529
I'm in too much detail here because

83
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,810
every thread isn't something that EMU

84
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,880
supports whereas I screw she does very

85
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,000
simple - I screw see in in theory uses

86
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,880
the same abstraction same system after

87
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,720
sending commands over a network it's

88
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,819
much less popular this essentially just

89
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,529
mean one company that's specified it and

90
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,300
made their devices but they combust now

91
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,850
so it's not really being developed

92
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,720
anymore it's much simpler than excuses

93
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,850
so if you're looking for simplicity that

94
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,990
might be a better option

95
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,750
you cannot route it which you can do

96
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,490
with ice crucian and M beneath so

97
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,720
there's quite a few does sensor

98
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,210
if you compare things in a nice-looking

99
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,070
table at least I hope it's nice-looking

100
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,120
if it doesn't just don't I also add a

101
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,980
channel of Ethernet which essentially

102
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,860
takes out the bat it's if I screw see

103
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,500
and all the bad bits of at everything

104
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:02,080
that combines them and that's the two

105
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,910
leftmost ones are the most interesting

106
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:13,110
ones just fix that

107
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,860
this is the protocol spec and it's an

108
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,690
markdown file in the github repository

109
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,220
it is a good read that's it it's if you

110
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,850
compare that gee I screw see like assets

111
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,120
295 file pages of ASCII text and then

112
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,660
you've only just read how to embed it so

113
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,240
it's much much simpler and much easy to

114
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,580
understand it's often say standard which

115
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,920
is not true for any of us it's a radical

116
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,790
protocol

117
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,190
it has authentication with the other

118
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,100
certificates or not if you don't do TLS

119
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,100
it has encryption it doesn't Asian sign

120
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,610
which is also the case for ICC I don't

121
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,810
know whether that's the case for a

122
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:25,850
channel of region and this is what makes

123
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,420
it very interesting there is a client as

124
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,940
well as a community server implemented

125
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,670
that does MVD we do have a nice cozy

126
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,480
client so if you want to build a qme

127
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,790
virtual device formalize Kushi device

128
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,800
that's perfectly possible but if you

129
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,950
want to export a device from you and you

130
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,890
you can only use em Bini for them and

131
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,450
this is what makes it so interesting for

132
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:01,790
virtualization export a device while you

133
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,460
VM is running and we've been a few

134
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,170
features that make it possible to

135
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,570
synchronize three devices one MBD device

136
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,400
on a remote climis machine and one

137
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,680
device locally so you can live migrate

138
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,550
your back-end storage while the VM is

139
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,030
running

140
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,560
for that we've had to add a few features

141
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,609
and I'll come back to that in a minute

142
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,190
there are few implementations ambit

143
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,080
about free open source and I've listed

144
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,620
them here

145
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:43,440
well most one is mine it's MVD surfer

146
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,200
which is the reference implementation as

147
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,180
well as Linux kernel itself which only

148
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,620
implements a client for obvious reasons

149
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,370
there's an implementation by a Japanese

150
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,850
person I've never met him and I forget

151
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:08,730
the name again the recent features but

152
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,300
they implement a few features of its own

153
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,740
and it is actually being used by a

154
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,800
particular storage provider called scale

155
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,390
way if you if you get a machine in that

156
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:27,630
system they're using XMP kids which was

157
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,750
written by Richard Jones of Red Hat it's

158
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,900
powerfully Esteves and it allows you

159
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,950
with a very simple API to implement and

160
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,050
MBD surfer in something so if you're

161
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,650
using your own storage system but isn't

162
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,360
it just a real farm but it's not a qme

163
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,660
image thing then it might be just what

164
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,439
you need to

165
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,430
and finally there's a big rig which is

166
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,530
an BSD clone I think it's a 4/4 of

167
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,800
obedience Oliver and they implemented

168
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,380
the MPD client site in with the same API

169
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,110
as Linux so you can work on that as well

170
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,579
I'm going to describe the most important

171
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,250
implementations which are the top five

172
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,710
because the trick is unlimited support

173
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:42,340
in time actually recently and a few

174
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,670
features that depend on the design of

175
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:54,160
your system at the same time without

176
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,750
requiring multiple instances of the same

177
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,540
server I understand that Richard is

178
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:09,330
working on for Q mu and for MPD servitor

179
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,970
if you have a client connection that you

180
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,890
connect to the server currently if you

181
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,450
just use just a single connection to

182
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,090
your server and you can get a bottleneck

183
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,850
on that one connection and yosef classic

184
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,650
of facebook has actually discovered that

185
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,870
by using multiple connections and black

186
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,000
and q in the linux kernel you can get

187
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,320
quite a performance gate so the linux

188
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,270
4.10 is the first kernel that implements

189
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,809
that feature so if you use ambient MINIX

190
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,390
4.10 with

191
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,860
and the client 3.15 or higher then you

192
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,710
will use you can use multiple clients

193
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,120
connections and you will get quite a

194
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,000
speed up their version to coordinate and

195
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,710
dedicated zambia service or doesn't

196
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,710
implement that part there is a white

197
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,809
sears command that we added recently by

198
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,320
request of feed me developers the point

199
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,600
of that is that if you want to sync from

200
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,669
one device to another it is useful to

201
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,179
first be able to say okay there's lots

202
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,980
of zeros here I don't want to actually

203
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,380
send them all over the wire so White's

204
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,970
yours is just an optimization that you

205
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,299
just sent a command saying that's too

206
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,799
big batch of series here just write them

207
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:46,529
and point implements CLS by just decrypt

208
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:48,480
it and I'm by two units the main circuit

209
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,500
or socket there so you can actually

210
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,730
connect your Linux kernel to a TLS

211
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,769
server cannot do that if you want to

212
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,139
swap and make that lock your system so

213
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:04,320
for that reason and the TLS options in

214
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,600
an many clients are if you try to use it

215
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,908
together the system will just perfectly

216
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:21,600
it's extremely easy to add your server

217
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,899
back-end and the kid has plug-in api's

218
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,010
for - oh can see and a few offers that

219
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,980
Africa I think Ruby G so whatever your

220
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,600
favorite languages I'm sure and Medicaid

221
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,659
can use it and you can just implement

222
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:39,720
reading and writing locks in in that

223
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,929
language which makes it easy to export

224
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,220
an image from or maybe you can

225
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:54,000
on the fly that's how do we do that

226
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,030
originally somebody with an idea this is

227
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,390
about five or ten years ago these days

228
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,070
though before we implement a new

229
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,809
protocol feature there's extensive

230
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,169
discussion on the male wrist then we

231
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,120
write a spec and then somebody writes

232
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,559
implementation that's either me or

233
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,860
somebody else and experiences that about

234
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,330
implementation are merged into the spec

235
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,860
if that's needed and then the spec is

236
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:34,150
very nice to make changes are merged

237
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,429
into the main Spector

238
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,260
outstanding that have been discussed and

239
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,669
for which the spec is complete what that

240
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:47,620
aren't implemented yet

241
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,730
the first one is structured replies the

242
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,549
reason we need those supplies is that

243
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,030
currently the MD protocol does have the

244
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,669
ability to signal an error or reach out

245
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:12,600
to a client so that means if you sent

246
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,390
replied to a client to options I think

247
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,350
you can send the header without reading

248
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,690
your data and saying well I was fine I

249
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,419
will be fine and if you do actually

250
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,669
encounter a reader you have to drop the

251
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,140
connection because he already said it

252
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,530
will be fine

253
00:22:47,049 --> 00:24:03,529
so by allowing this so if you try to

254
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,629
write to it we might give you an inner

255
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:08,240
space it could be anything essentially

256
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,490
on the spec allows for extensibility

257
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,230
there by using this it would allow you

258
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,750
to make an incremental backup VM that is

259
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,610
currently running based on a snapshot

260
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,460
etc etc and that's actually the main

261
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,500
reason why we why we are at this this

262
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,860
option the second one which is the info

263
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,659
and go

264
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:34,659
thing to fix another issue we have in

265
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,149
the negotiation phase currently if you

266
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,389
select an unnamed exports but then the

267
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,239
export name doesn't actually exists

268
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,379
there's no way for the server to say

269
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,479
that - double connection and if Arango

270
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,820
try to fix that by making it a bit more

271
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,019
generic you've also got an extra option

272
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,700
that were currently discussing it's not

273
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,849
the spec isn't finished yet but the the

274
00:24:57,849 --> 00:24:59,950
feature is to allow an active resize

275
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,049
from the client so the client can say

276
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:04,479
please make this modifies now that they

277
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,190
crop it and the size whatever it is

278
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,649
right now extra needs some finishing up

279
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:14,668
but it looks like it's going to happen

280
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,360
right demo time we have fun and also fun

281
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:44,179
essentially it shows me the experts

282
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,960
that's my okay that my server house this

283
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,970
is my laptop so I'm just expecting a few

284
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,759
test devices that I development the

285
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,950
first one is called tests the second one

286
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,379
is called test tube and the first one is

287
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:58,909
called Mac image I don't even remember

288
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,879
what that was supposed to be but the

289
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,169
first one actually contains an

290
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:06,039
installation of the system

291
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,720
I can with this your format I can tell

292
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,429
if I want to connect to an MD device at

293
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:20,850
that location

294
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,270
sorry of course

295
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,240
that should be better so now we have a

296
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,570
I don't know if you can see it

297
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,869
[Applause]

298
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,809
yeah it's it's bad just a bit from

299
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:11,070
Sweden I think yeah that's it doesn't

300
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,809
fit on this small screen but there we

301
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:13,610
are

302
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,449
looks like a linear custom booty

303
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,960
and this is running over nvidia

304
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,390
currently is just using and the server

305
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,210
with simple web file as backend but

306
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,100
since the server rooms in user space it

307
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,260
could essentially be anything you could

308
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,740
have something that just uses it uses a

309
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,840
Powerball and experts from the top file

310
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,140
and that's magic there you can do

311
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,860
anything you want

312
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:54,579
[Applause]

313
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,839
[Music]

314
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,410
[Music]

315
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,479
[Applause]

316
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,389
[Music]

317
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:23,210
and md5 devices and and second time at a

318
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,830
customer site where they when certain

319
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,679
16-bit link between the keynotes and I

320
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,820
could not see the difference between

321
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,929
significant really there are some

322
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,440
differences but I don't think it has

323
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,440
issues

324
00:29:48,070 --> 00:30:46,730
in one gpn point to your mind something

325
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,549
about balancing that and referring to a

326
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,960
cluster can you do something like that

327
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:17,510
actually requires them to be essentially

328
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,280
if you wanted to if you had several

329
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,020
sorts which have the same back end

330
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,260
somehow which synchronized somehow and

331
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,970
which synchronize synchronize on the

332
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,610
same signal points that I will find in

333
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,380
the MD protocol that you could perfectly

334
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,030
well in several service

335
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,729
[Music]

336
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,589
[Music]

337
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,469
[Music]

338
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,299
[Music]

339
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,180
well you know there is that there are

340
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,090
some verticals like cannabis before

341
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,830
hopeful but one there you have a serum

342
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,600
end of rectifiers and that should

343
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,800
therapy work with without you

344
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,879
[Music]

345
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,869
[Music]

346
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:55,250
if the service and the back end because

347
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,410
we can't go deep deformations but there

348
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,980
is that

349
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:16,900
Paris any motions have you not specified

350
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,550
the meta information do you have or do

351
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,369
you expect some how do you expect the

352
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,580
different clients work with this meta

353
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,460
information

354
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,719
[Music]

355
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,379
[Music]

356
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,210
so essentially the ideas you negotiate a

357
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,019
myth of data context during the

358
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,509
negotiation phase and the metabolic

359
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:12,329
context is there's a namespaced strength

360
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,359
so you say this these places can be q

361
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,670
and you can be expected to meet base

362
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:25,650
whatever and then something in the

363
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,380
namespace should have its own spec

364
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,910
somewhere and that will define how it

365
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,220
works and then during negotiation you

366
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,059
can say I want to see this particular

367
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,170
complex and when you use it and then

368
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,650
during the actual phase where you want

369
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,859
to you want to read the information you

370
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,339
get a message text ID that refers to

371
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,369
what if you negotiated at first so it

372
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,369
allows people to add as many complexes

373
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:55,680
as they want so it should be fairly

374
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,130
flexible there are two contexts sorry

375
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,319
there's one context in the spec which is

376
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,259
for sparseness that is defined in the

377
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:07,349
base pack itself that you can add as

378
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,940
many as you want and in qme is probably

379
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,829
going to add a few as I understand

380
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
Enterprise is usually you have the

381
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:23,570
assumption the storage is always up and

382
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,590
[Music]

383
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:39,280
has been absent to allow a client when

384
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:50,890
the connection drops may be recovered do

385
00:37:50,890 --> 00:38:02,530
you think with the multi connection

386
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,170
stuff I just saw that passed by

387
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,950
yesterday

388
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,080
where was this morning mature from

389
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,330
yourself where if you've got like four

390
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:16,420
connections and one gets gets back if

391
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,350
you use on top of MBD and one of them

392
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,940
then you still have another connection

393
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,870
so there's a few options there that

394
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,670
essentially it's not been well defined

395
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,380
what happens if the connection drops

396
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:36,840
unexpectedly the answer is the questions

397
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,470
that should be that should be that

398
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,339
should be perfectly fine yeah

399
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,710
no more questions

400
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,809
[Applause]
