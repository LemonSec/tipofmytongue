1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,290
hello

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,110
nice to meet you there are two type of

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,879
free software developer the world that

4
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:12,740
have the one that are famous and people

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
like me I'm not really famous to be

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,990
honest free like in free software is the

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,510
capacity for a person like me and others

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,030
to present what they do and not who they

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,150
are and I really like it so thank you

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,710
for them that my first thank you of the

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,410
day and here is a story and every night

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,940
story where is my slide every story

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,890
begins with too much time on your end

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,399
and a book sorry for the English speaker

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,829
but anyway remember that in mathematics

16
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,870
we don't care about what is written so

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,239
you will have mathematic books that is

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,550
written in French but all the formula in

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,489
English don't worry we are translated so

20
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,010
this book there is called the deep shoot

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,860
linear algebra and I was like whoa fine

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,399
it's looking fun this book for

23
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,899
definition and fern that only me

24
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,049
understand basically what my book was

25
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,479
saying is that it was a cool project

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,789
manager it was saying I will not tell

27
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,439
you how to implement stuff I will just

28
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,139
tell you how it's working the rules and

29
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,389
then once you implement once you you

30
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:26,420
follow the rules you have metrics this

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,069
one is a little bit kept you attracted

32
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,619
as we say in French and then you've got

33
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,639
least surprises

34
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,799
I will come on it later because I love

35
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,819
to have least surprising ah

36
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,679
you know what I mean basically as you

37
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:46,579
see we've got associativity new element

38
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,139
of addition a neutral element of

39
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:50,349
addition multiplication and so long and

40
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:54,979
I want to point is it this one yeah I

41
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,759
want to point that one is not one you

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,450
will see it later

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,560
zero is not zero computer in town Oh

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,569
integers and real numbers are not float

45
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,909
but good enough lies made a good enough

46
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,459
truth and I will try to prove it to you

47
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,190
we've got we don't know it can work so

48
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,670
once you've got these rules you code

49
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,310
so I've covered a kind of unit test that

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,410
is testing for the basic stuff like a

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,110
plus B equals B plus a and stuff like

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,180
that which is not very interesting but I

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,970
was like why not do it if we can we do

54
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,810
so basically I began with the normal

55
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,040
basic type of what we don't see a

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,540
finger-sized so basically I begin with a

57
00:02:48,540 --> 00:03:04,860
basic type of Python so basically

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,560
complex time is following the linear

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:21,269
algebra here oh oh oh oh oh c'mon say

60
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:29,100
exists so for fun I tried an imperious

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,799
they are behaving like they should not

62
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,890
like they should behave like the theorem

63
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,079
of linear algebra saying the floats are

64
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,430
doing the same the ins are doing the

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,260
same I was pretty surprised with the

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,930
decimal but if the tests are saying no

67
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,140
but it's no lots of weight is complex

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,720
I love complex and at least know

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,420
obviously lists are not following the

70
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,690
linear algebra you can try but no yeah

71
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm gonna introduce sorry for the stuff

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,230
so if you can go on the internet you you

73
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,260
will have the full student information

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,030
there is a small confusion that I

75
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,620
created I don't think it's a theorem I

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,720
don't know what it is if you take entry

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,970
gate mutable mappings that are

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,000
implemented in dict that we all know you

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,370
can take a path to a key and transform

80
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,858
it into a top and it's equivalent form

81
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,570
so there is a canonical form of

82
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,120
intricated dict that are making them

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,460
like a dict so i can reason on one level

84
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,200
dict but in fact i can think of

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,820
intricated dict and

86
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,770
the other way around is working because

87
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,140
it's a bijection it's an e so morphism

88
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,610
great stuff is a morphism believe me oh

89
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,020
not everybody believes in is a morphism

90
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,360
i will prove it to you later

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
don't worry so like an obnoxious project

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,150
manager the the math book is trying to

93
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,610
tell me how to do stuff I can tell you I

94
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,300
don't like it

95
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,340
I just prefer when I'm given the rules

96
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,370
to check anyway you've got a plus u plus

97
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,870
V oh we please wait that is supposed to

98
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,820
look like this and the multiplication by

99
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,010
a scalar that is looking like this and

100
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,920
this one this one is important you will

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,730
see I'm going to cheat in the

102
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,100
implementation

103
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,200
yahooo how do we do an implementation

104
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,400
that is very naive which I am I'm very

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,370
naive in fact so what I did is I

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,780
propagated the plus on the right side

107
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,880
like it's written in the books but since

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,240
I was at it I was like why not choose a

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,250
idea of duck typing yes we're coming to

110
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,110
it duck typing is a little bit like

111
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,880
linear algebra if it quacks like a duck

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,880
and it's fly like a duck and it's good

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,050
like a maggot canal then it's a duck and

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,650
I was like well why not choose both at

115
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,850
the point where you are you're trying to

116
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,860
do something silly be silly to the top

117
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,810
you're never winning anything by doing

118
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,500
it with you know one water you go out so

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,100
what I did is that I overloaded the

120
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,410
operator since I'm Dyslexic and I don't

121
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,870
know my right and my life I ll plug

122
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,910
everything on the immediate addition

123
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,130
subtraction multiplication division so

124
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,130
it's not very fast I'm sorry and then I

125
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,080
implemented neg this way so that I'm

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,820
consistent with the stuff I show you and

127
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,190
well it was very it was quite easy to do

128
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,230
the stuff you are not seeing very is

129
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,580
that I'm saying that basically you can

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,230
probably do it in any kind of language

131
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,570
to be on it honest at least in Perl joke

132
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,890
so does it pass my own test yes I just

133
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,770
think

134
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,610
I love it when you pass your own test

135
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,280
you can be proud so I did implement

136
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,830
actually I didn't miss code I think I

137
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,840
stole it on the internet and it was made

138
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
by a good person whose name was Widow

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,479
from something I guess

140
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,240
but anyway it's my code now it's free

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,550
software you know so now we've got this

142
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,030
which is uh I didn't put a joke so I got

143
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,400
this which is so my multiplication I

144
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,990
forgot to say that there is a little

145
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,220
twist in the minification when you're

146
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,990
taking a that is a scaler and you're

147
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,970
multiplying it you're putting two every

148
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,199
leaves but when you've got a dictionary

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,440
like when you've got a vector when you

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,789
are doing if you've got the same key

151
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,789
you're adding the same key side by side

152
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,349
but if the key doesn't exist I created

153
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:26,750
on the other side when you've got

154
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,150
multiplication I it's very complex

155
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,289
you're going to see it when it's going

156
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,849
to be working with the ipython notebook

157
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,069
that we don't have because my computer

158
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,720
is not showing it don't worry I had a

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,220
back-up plan so ah excuse me I've got to

160
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,599
go back yes yes I've got new rules that

161
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,610
I forgot to implement in my test but I

162
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,940
passed it I checked so we've got the dot

163
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,610
product that I use with the perimeter

164
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,520
that is making these amorphous --n so

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,070
basically I'm taking I'm not even

166
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,750
talking about 3d geometry I'm just

167
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,680
taking random name of case for my dict

168
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,169
and when I'm doing my dot product I've

169
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,030
got exactly the result of the akkadian

170
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,370
geometry without even trying to

171
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,310
implement the euclidean geometry so so

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,630
far it's working it's working for

173
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,979
dimensions that are even I of n 3 or 2

174
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,810
I'm too much into geometry I'm sorry I

175
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,229
love it

176
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,180
yeah it was intended to be fun you are

177
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,860
the right to love from time to time it's

178
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,530
very hard to be there Oh carry me Oh

179
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,419
effect you don't know you know not on my

180
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,958
side so dot product is one step away

181
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,940
from distance thank you

182
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,620
so this is the definition of apps

183
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,900
absolutely you ABS ABS ABS no no no but

184
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,600
a distance is a absolute value of you

185
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,870
- V so and when yeah math been assigned

186
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,970
but geometrical turn of acute angle I

187
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,720
tried very hard to make jokes for you

188
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,389
though anyway so I took a random

189
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,980
definition that was in the book and it

190
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,870
was like oh can it work now you've got

191
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,970
discussed theta stuff that I don't

192
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,769
really know what it says and you just

193
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,050
have to pay attention that it should be

194
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,660
non null but anyway when you implement

195
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,519
it this way I know people ate a

196
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,949
one-liner but I was April coder so I've

197
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,759
got the right to do it once again we're

198
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,620
taking random example two dimensions

199
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,810
it's doing what it's supposed to do we

200
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,759
are checking and when we are trying with

201
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,040
a 3d 4d vector it's doing the same thing

202
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,019
and when we are dividing by a null

203
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,029
vector it's doing exactly what it's

204
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,440
supposed to do which is an exception of

205
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,600
a division division by zero yes it's

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,310
working

207
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,139
haven't we proud we didn't even did a

208
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,050
lot of code yeah I'm focusing too much

209
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,709
on geometry I know it already that's

210
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,959
apart whether I don't have my where is a

211
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,209
Stefan I'm deep nobody I'm supposed

212
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:08,269
to show you some cut no I'm joking when

213
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:09,649
you know that everything can go wrong

214
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,410
you prepare a back-up plan and the

215
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,449
back-up plan was to have normally I was

216
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,889
supposed to whoever I hope I've got a

217
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,300
good memory please help me God please

218
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,180
yes normally if I had a ipython notebook

219
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,300
I would have made it you know like magic

220
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,829
and make stuff appear like a magician

221
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:34,519
and so oh it is sorry I'm cutting in

222
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,899
Python 2 right now I'm sorry I tend to

223
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,490
go in Python free but right now I'm

224
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,300
doing my cider so here is a normal

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,000
vector I've taken globally the example

226
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,630
in the named collection of std-free of

227
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,699
Python which is a point in the color

228
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,339
space nothing new Under the Sun it's a

229
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,089
classical one then if you check when

230
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,439
you're adding with I said that 0 is not

231
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,370
0 look at

232
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,040
it this is not zero but if you look at

233
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,589
it it's the same so this is should be

234
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:17,270
true and this should be equal that it's

235
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,680
just we are not in a geometrical space

236
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,150
where is a lot of stuff that are not

237
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,650
geometry we're not living in the world

238
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,770
of the little mama that uh you know we

239
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,120
are in the world of computers we are

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,140
working the way they are this normally 0

241
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,050
it is equal to minus 1 plus 101 plus

242
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,080
minus 1 it should be true yeah of course

243
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,200
it's getting the joke so what happened

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,910
so when I was saying that integers are

245
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,910
not internet integers and floats are not

246
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,390
real numbers the computer is not exactly

247
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,690
liking the real geometry of the algebra

248
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,040
books you have to live with the fact

249
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,170
that the word is imperfect it's called

250
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,920
the hell of the float like it was a set

251
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
1 second cat which isn't known that was

252
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
used in electronic to represent the

253
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,490
number in memory and that's a reason why

254
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,600
we have got so much work it's non

255
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,850
commutative and non commutative which is

256
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,339
breaking a lot of assumption of linear

257
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,230
algebra so it's not my fault it's not

258
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:23,620
Python thought it's a fault of IBM so

259
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,560
you've got this unit vector neutral

260
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,390
amount of multiplication I remember it's

261
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,250
called in excuse me I in fact I was not

262
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,339
good at school so we've got this stuff

263
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,920
that when you multiply by itself it

264
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,230
doesn't move it doesn't move yes then

265
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,209
we've got this one why did I wrote this

266
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,060
one because it's giving the same result

267
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,130
it's another way to be to write one and

268
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,230
then that arm what is doing this I'm

269
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,650
multiplying itself by itself and I

270
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,550
dividing it by itself

271
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,560
I still have almost the same result so

272
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,060
actually it's working the fact of

273
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,490
propagating the multiplication to the

274
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,040
keys and then just thinking it should

275
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,890
work like addition in vectors we've a

276
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,500
few tricks that I will not give away

277
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,150
because it's an open source and you

278
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,690
cannot read it

279
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,699
it's making that I've got a unit vector

280
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,269
in fact and a over a is a unit vector

281
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,459
and it has a weird shape that you will

282
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,860
see later I'm very proud of this one

283
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,440
which is a conservation April a is equal

284
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,940
that to a and it's true

285
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,190
it's amazing why my coordinate so

286
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,250
convenient be no no ia sauce people

287
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,589
noticing it no it's a job no no one

288
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,600
really not a good public am sorry you

289
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,040
could help me a little bit from time to

290
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,610
time

291
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,870
well yeah it's it's not a bug

292
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,089
it's really like it should behave when

293
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,649
you've got the number you divide by zero

294
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,630
it making a zero division by zero

295
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,519
exception and if you look at it

296
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,190
correctly every number are in fact an

297
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,259
implicit 1 dimensional vector my brain

298
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,360
is he's burning on this one believe me

299
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,529
it's not too tough I'm really sorry so

300
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,920
since I used to to solve equation

301
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,480
without putting them because I was doing

302
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,860
something called physics and not

303
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,370
mathematics I used to be working with

304
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,100
intuition the the important part is can

305
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,980
we build an intuition of what this stuff

306
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,310
would be meaning the fact that a plus 0

307
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,889
is equal to a giving that we are calling

308
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,660
plus a translation its meaning that if

309
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,790
you move yourself from nothing you will

310
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,980
not move same thing is going with the

311
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,329
multiplication by 1 if you stretch

312
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:52,949
yourself from your own size it's not

313
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,819
going to change and yeah I wanted to

314
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:58,319
show you what is a unit vector it has

315
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,480
more than because of the definition and

316
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,829
made of the multiplication and I say

317
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,990
that I don't like project manager

318
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,939
telling me how to do stuff as long as

319
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,949
I'm having the theorem that are being

320
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,199
respected I mean my stuff are working so

321
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,089
obviously it's a project manager that is

322
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:12,930
wrong not me

323
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,230
so my multiplication is giving result

324
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,730
that are pretty interesting is that

325
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,740
we've got the unique vector by dividing

326
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,750
the vector by itself which is going in

327
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,220
every direction but it's also vs and

328
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,470
this and you will see that maybe it has

329
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,740
a maybe it's not totally stupid maybe

330
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,680
this is well known it's a so I Edition

331
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,410
and multiplication should be related by

332
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,660
this it's very important that you have

333
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,800
to understand that when you're

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,930
multiplying something by a scalar you're

335
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,610
changing the direction the scalar is the

336
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,170
direction of the number of time of the

337
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,530
vector so when you're going in your

338
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,330
direction and then going back from your

339
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,800
direction you're going back to where you

340
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,170
were so it's pretty having an intuition

341
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,500
that plus and ommatidia are working oh

342
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,150
excuse me

343
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,030
together how much mean do I have thank

344
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,560
you I'm rushing to give you five minutes

345
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,860
so this is a translation of one and I'm

346
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,740
applying only on P and it's working like

347
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,070
it should exit equal to 2y 2 2 and Z 2

348
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,850
so kind of multiplying in my context

349
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,890
with this it's kind of saying that we

350
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,610
are sub selecting the dict and this dict

351
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,490
is looking like a vector so with

352
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,690
multiple mappings to be on it because I

353
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,090
didn't use for the implementation as

354
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,310
traits I never used the word kicked I'm

355
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,190
using mutable mappings it's duck typing

356
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,900
and it's just a stuff with square

357
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,410
bracket attempts ETA Len and stuff like

358
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,120
that it's not actually dick time using

359
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,050
you could do it with other stuff so it's

360
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,210
a kind of sub selection of her space

361
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,430
that could be in a space and I remember

362
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,740
that I had a stuff in my book saying

363
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,180
that maybe it's a sub vectorial space I

364
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,890
read them like math seriously I love to

365
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,930
implement them but the rest is not funny

366
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,150
just because I could I went on the

367
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,310
internet and took a random formula this

368
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,569
one and I decided to implement it to see

369
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,750
if it's working so I made a world

370
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,810
contrary which is the normal way of for

371
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,849
people that are doing text indexation to

372
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,760
represent the text and I decided without

373
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
any BS to give me a point to give how

374
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,430
much of anything it would be and when I

375
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,190
try to see if the direction of my topic

376
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,270
with Python for them was working and

377
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,550
also cosine it's for knowing if two

378
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,480
vectors are pointing

379
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
in the same direction and cosine

380
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,460
similarity it's in the case you've got a

381
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,010
base that is infinite and sometime maybe

382
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,020
it's important to know about the one

383
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,110
that are not there I'll go under which

384
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,240
Padilla page I don't understand it but

385
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,650
there was a nice formula so I used it

386
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,150
and I ever got the intuition that I'm

387
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,000
right so basically what is the direction

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,890
of first then Python for them and this

389
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,720
thing yes

390
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,929
pet eight I don't respect that eight all

391
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,260
the time

392
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,049
so basically the results are that

393
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,429
concerning this topic am a little bit of

394
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,460
topic but considering two concerning for

395
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,669
them in total in topic which is I'm very

396
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,690
proud of myself so it's different so is

397
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,160
there a trick to algebra is known as

398
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,309
rubric type I don't have a lot of time I

399
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,370
can go back on it later one day but I

400
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,080
thought of it it's possible you can

401
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
there are times where you cannot define

402
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
plus but in the context of a distance

403
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,950
you can define - to know how far an

404
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,049
object is from another object or a dict

405
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:54,160
excuse me addicted to thank you you

406
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,559
in fact I hadn't ever back a plane I got

407
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,390
with a back-up plan I used to be a

408
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,150
sysadmin so actual use technique

409
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,940
dictation you know in fact it's because

410
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,330
of my first mission as a she's emotional

411
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,870
that I knew about it lock passing its

412
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,990
special dick manipulation and oh

413
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,750
another geometrical joke I ate the class

414
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,780
point 2d when you've got your complex

415
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,760
type we even four years equity onions

416
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,870
that are more efficient for doing

417
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,480
rotation I want to say that I really

418
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
don't like this I like the 2d point

419
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,340
class as much as I like jello word

420
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,250
example yeah another geometry and

421
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:43,059
parallelism you catch it when you've got

422
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,600
 you can add it mutable mapping

423
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,820
like bigger cache and rock pile cache

424
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,040
are outputting the region like dick but

425
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,010
in fact they are not dict it's it's just

426
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,080
an abstraction it's a view I'm a table

427
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,190
mapping doesn't have to be

428
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,380
we table mapping nothing prevent you for

429
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,290
taking the keys shot them on the ash and

430
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,890
then send it to never computer if the

431
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,410
network is always working and stuff like

432
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,630
that it will work it will do parallelism

433
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,240
and since every key is a distinct

434
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,430
dimension it's without side effect so

435
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,400
you can do it so it's I mean what I'm

436
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,660
doing is very nice guys well should you

437
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,390
use my library yeah we are going near to

438
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,540
the question and answer basically I'm

439
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,150
doing bagel inside or hiking how I'm a

440
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,620
little bit over when with time I will

441
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,550
push the modification that I saw and the

442
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,150
last time I try to make my module pass

443
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,430
the Python free was a long time ago when

444
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,240
it was a pain and I will make from some

445
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,260
effort for you I've got an either

446
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,510
library which has a lot more funny stuff

447
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,270
in it but it's I don't encourage it I'm

448
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,450
using an archery right now the naming is

449
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,690
a pain is a pain the pants are not a

450
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,340
good idea

451
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,410
don't use my convention for naming stuff

452
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,150
it's really not a good idea I'm a bad

453
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,470
color on this one yes I've got a lot of

454
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,320
matting in this project because when

455
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,510
you've got to dimension and vectors you

456
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,360
can build matrix I already did it

457
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,280
but it's non commutative so it's pieces

458
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,000
you need I'm not in peace with myself

459
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,070
the whole way of algebra I like I would

460
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,170
like to work with the commutator algebra

461
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,210
because we've got the flood problem and

462
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,250
I would like to know how much we are

463
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,320
making mistakes when we are using some

464
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,590
stuff like floats the close to L close

465
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,090
to operators that could we could

466
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,980
implement and objects so that we could

467
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,230
always know we've got profile like

468
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,870
psychometric profile or if I'm Donald

469
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,000
Trump and I want to know about people if

470
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,610
people are profiling matching a profile

471
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,980
I know it's very utopian use of

472
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,910
computers no I'm joking much more for

473
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,260
inmate since you can use it to know if

474
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,490
people are going to have a disease or

475
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,590
not you can also use computer for good

476
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,430
stuff you know and there is a set of G

477
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,840
brace that can be implemented in the

478
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,540
same fashion I've been working on it a

479
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,090
little bit yes

480
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,100
I'm very bad at communicating ideas I

481
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,049
proposed it to Python ideas it was a

482
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,690
flop and it's because my communication

483
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,350
skills are below average and that's when

484
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,580
we are coming to the yeah really if

485
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,049
you're not laughing I'm not redoing my

486
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:28,510
job correctly so a lot of things to

487
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,110
