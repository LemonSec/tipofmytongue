1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,869
so

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,300
everybody I'm here to tell you a bit

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,600
about during bass game designer

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,360
it's an idea we had with a friend a few

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,870
figures ago the point was that I was

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,570
more about the interaction Curie and all

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,680
that and he was more about cooking which

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,300
we'll show at some point in the slider

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,870
and drawing him so he wasn't see I was

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,610
not of course I mean to stuff together

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,469
no alcohol involved whatsoever of course

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,719
at first so what we had is more less

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,269
that the point was to get as an emission

14
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:44,199
point in gaming a drawing so at first it

15
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,359
was the idea of drawing after it was

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,510
just pigments on canvas and you see it

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,870
went up quite quite fast so what I we

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,019
present you is the concept first what I

19
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,850
told you a bit already about right now

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,089
then game design and game perception you

21
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,319
can imagine that when you have a

22
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,609
controller you have some kind of

23
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,590
expectation about game design when

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,659
you're dealing with colors with papers

25
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,630
with food at some point you have very

26
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,540
different kind of expectation and not

27
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,189
only about the design of the game itself

28
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,930
because you draw your own game in the

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,110
end but also got the perception of it in

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,909
this idea of loop between game design

31
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,259
and game player and the fact that you

32
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,729
always switch from one to another and

33
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,640
this kind of of games is a strong point

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,180
of this talk then we discuss the tech

35
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,780
itself we try to build a kit and a

36
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,350
library to allow well at first us to

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,170
make some games in more easy way and of

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,149
course all the people so it's both open

39
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,280
source open hardware and I hope in the

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,890
end we want to have a try at that but

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,340
first of all the most important is that

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,860
it's mud

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,560
so the point is that for inspiration not

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,180
small s mother mother some kind of

45
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,520
metaphor of the real water we award is

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,400
then again messy as my friend yes a

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,870
wonderful picture right you want to

48
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,330
avoid it's like you know you come home

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,240
you have your messy shoes you just get

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,580
rid of them because you enter a clean

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,350
whatever environment where you want to

52
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,110
feel at ease and control of everything

53
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,300
this is nice and sometimes when you want

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,740
to curl when you want to create some

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,120
kind of virtual what is what you want to

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,010
do to you have something that is clear

57
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,560
you have like clear shapes clear vision

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,260
and all that and gameplay and everything

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,150
is let's say in control knowledge of

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,770
course I'm talking in a very very

61
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,720
generic way but that's not the real

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,660
world you have huge messiness so the

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,760
point would be why actually would you

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
try to base your game or your

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,870
interaction or your interface on the

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,610
real world and not one of your twelve

67
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,420
water there is actually one main point

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,400
for that is that you have a set of rules

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
which are already there if for instance

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,489
you try to build a virtual reality or

71
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,650
something and something you if you want

72
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,769
to use you have a new game then you have

73
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,450
usually one point that the drawing

74
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,459
points like the game engine like the

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,260
graphing engine or like I know the

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,050
physic engine for instance you see if

77
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,239
you sometimes walking pretty well and

78
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,930
the graphics are amazing so you see it's

79
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,120
actually and the reason why not using it

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,030
because it's messy but when you use that

81
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,910
actually I mean this is a joke about of

82
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,590
course like the physic and the graffiti

83
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,420
and how is that but you have a lot of

84
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,239
rules that you can base upon and just

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,620
the classic one but others like for

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,720
instance we are based on drawing

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,390
everybody knows how to draw so we didn't

88
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,340
have a tutorial it's like when we show

89
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,200
people like a this is a felt pen did you

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
know how to use it that you have to this

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,500
is amazing

92
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,180
in the color of the pen stays on the

93
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,940
paper like no it's okay so like

94
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,860
everybody knows how to do that and this

95
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,050
is the fun part that people just can go

96
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,300
with it and another point where you see

97
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,550
later on the talk but I stay a long time

98
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,100
in this slide because for me it's the

99
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,140
most important one actually another

100
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,358
stuff is that you raise yourself in

101
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,970
reality you will use a few set of rules

102
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,520
that you will know then again like at

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,350
the physical or whatever stuff the felt

104
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,940
pen and all that but you will be always

105
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,590
surprised by the other one you haven't

106
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,230
thought about and people will come on

107
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,520
your interface your game and whatever

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
and we use disco rules that for them are

109
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,080
really natural and you didn't think

110
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,850
about that and we see the game

111
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,100
perception that we had a huge surprise

112
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,890
about that so now the concept itself is

113
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,490
what because I tell you a lot about the

114
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,620
drawee and all that in the end pretty

115
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,070
simple

116
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,150
you got what the files panel here the

117
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,480
paper here do whatever you want like you

118
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,520
can already see for instance that you

119
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,720
have two kinds of doings that are pretty

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,070
different depending on what you want to

121
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,380
play here for instance you have this

122
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,840
kind of old gaming watch kind of games

123
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,060
that you can create I mean on top of

124
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,510
your mind

125
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,669
there you have free paper which was some

126
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,040
kind of recreation of a pinball so

127
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,780
depending on what kind of game you want

128
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,290
to create

129
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,610
of course the drawing be very very

130
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,210
different then you have up there that

131
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,300
you've overcome very simple which one at

132
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,040
some point you get a very expensive one

133
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
because of course the needs of precision

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,419
are amazing and no no cheaper character

135
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,780
is working very fine and then you have

136
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,510
of the predictor that we project back on

137
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,810
top of the drawing both straight on the

138
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,760
drawing so you can see the red during

139
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,900
there that can be actually highlight and

140
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,790
new stuff I like the flippers here and

141
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,270
push the bug here the point is that and

142
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,640
this is actually one of the gameplay

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,680
issue who we are trying to tackle is

144
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,290
that what you're drawing is of course

145
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,630
static if you draw I'm not sure you have

146
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,760
yes you do if you have yellow here

147
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,560
actually if you liked it or not you can

148
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,980
make it disappear or not so

149
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,570
play with it but you can make it move in

150
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,540
the end so if you want to have something

151
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,490
dynamic real dynamics and of course you

152
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,230
have to be afraid to be of your child

153
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,150
because well we are what is not perfect

154
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,830
when you are when it's about drawing it

155
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,700
so you have this kind of frame of loop

156
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,880
between you draw you project back on top

157
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,410
and then you have of course a controller

158
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,330
which is not always a must but still

159
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,790
here as a pinball you have two buttons

160
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,550
on the side and here you have something

161
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,260
from the shape I have no idea what it is

162
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,390
I mean control generic one of course so

163
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,730
the point of of doing is not just you

164
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,410
have a huge doodle and you do whatever

165
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,200
you want from it the point was to try to

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,930
create language based on that a set of

167
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,110
rules and you know we always had two

168
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,660
steps on it the first one was to try to

169
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,420
describe as better as we could what kind

170
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,180
of shapes one would write down sorry if

171
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,970
possible we try to to get out of

172
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,670
symbolic shapes we didn't want to have

173
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,110
something like okay if you draw a square

174
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,880
it will result if you draw a circle it

175
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
should be that across and it will be

176
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,350
that because then you go no into some

177
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,990
kind of code back again and we have a

178
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,370
language of shapes and you don't have

179
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,970
long weight of drawing so here for

180
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,830
instance you have a pin board which is I

181
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,260
think so you see what first of all

182
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,969
different colors you see yellow

183
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,389
green and blue so for instance in the

184
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,069
case of the pinball the blue with balls

185
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,419
so we just like bounce on it the red is

186
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,549
a bumper or a shooter meaning I'll go to

187
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,499
like bounce back a lot and if you do

188
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,849
that many times it will disappear and

189
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,529
destroy you can go through for instance

190
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,809
here you see it highlight so it rebounds

191
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,360
and here the road actually already

192
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,249
bounced so it's destroyed so now the

193
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,659
world can go through and the player

194
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,319
who's drill is Rob's on our acceleration

195
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,939
and yellow is four points so you have

196
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,529
many many kind of game place depending

197
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,659
on the color modern again if it was just

198
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,269
colors you miss this much fun you can

199
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,309
see for instance that here you have

200
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,219
another flipper which is weird because I

201
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,659
told you everything about the color so

202
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,999
you should not be able to do that but

203
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,099
the fatty is depending on how you draw

204
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,069
actually if it's a point a line or if

205
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,659
you see opening something inside of

206
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,458
another shape then you have different

207
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,339
behaviors and the point was that first

208
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,698
to try to get features actually on the

209
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:41,828
drawing too for instance when we try to

210
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,889
create another game we know that okay

211
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:46,629
what is our language well what can we

212
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,790
use actually to describe the drawing and

213
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,529
to use that to create a gameplay from

214
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,110
from it and the second point is when you

215
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,500
have this kind of library done then you

216
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,120
decide which feature you want to get and

217
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,639
what's a kind of game player you want to

218
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,519
add to it for instance in this case we

219
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,139
go back to the other games which was

220
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,970
some kind of game in much a game so if

221
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,439
you don't remember who this figure it's

222
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,329
yeah he gets it

223
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,579
you have to shapes actuate moving like

224
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,250
that here you don't have any more walls

225
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,379
but you have the players themselves the

226
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,959
green is actually a list of bonuses and

227
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,850
the red our melissa's so you die when

228
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,389
you get them and you see the lines you

229
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,250
secure the movement of the shapes it

230
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,079
will start from there and then use one

231
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,029
by one there and then you have to read

232
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,189
your cursor to be able to avoid your

233
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,740
humor to get some so there if you check

234
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,790
actually you should always a mistake

235
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,949
here to get the bonus and over more as

236
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,230
this one so this is interesting to know

237
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,260
that

238
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,200
and this is another point with Slater is

239
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
you create your you create your game and

240
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,130
you play it so if your game suck maybe

241
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:08,630
it's because you create a game that your

242
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,670
game is not fun and suck no you don't

243
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,410
say that you with a drawing you can

244
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,720
create your evil designer and I'm saying

245
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,620
that with be happy about that

246
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,780
because what is very fun to little

247
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,940
designs through drawing we are trying to

248
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,890
reach a point where it's not just level

249
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,360
design but you really interact with the

250
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,550
drawing sometimes happening but not

251
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,640
always so the tech who can go quickly

252
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,260
over that because it's already a bit of

253
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,870
it you have two side software and

254
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,130
hardware the software is what you saw

255
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,530
idea is a bit being like the library the

256
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,480
hardware the point of it because you can

257
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,520
imagine like you just need a lie on a

258
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,430
webcam of the predictor and then you're

259
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,800
set why actually would you need a kit to

260
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,260
be there what you wanted to do is to

261
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,300
make it as easy as possible for other

262
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,180
people to reuse the tech we had this

263
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,740
idea about your drawing beds

264
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,320
interactional the more we pushed it the

265
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,260
more we found new stuff I try to do is

266
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,450
it and we know that we're very lazy

267
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,370
people and we will be able to explore

268
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,860
completely this medium so when other

269
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,740
people actually to try out stuff for

270
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,830
that

271
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,240
open or were to so people can get

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,980
actually you know that is very complex

273
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,150
but still people can can can get you

274
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,980
online and then we create it so they can

275
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,950
have some kind of nice setup I know they

276
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,180
explained that when you got just the

277
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,380
video protector of the webcam and you

278
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,320
have to spend like an elapsed time to

279
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,330
just be sure everything is in the right

280
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,850
acts access it's not very very fun when

281
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,410
you got this everything set about you on

282
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,250
the table then it is a reason after that

283
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,260
you have soda library the point was just

284
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,000
to get

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,980
Oh Jimmy took a collection because you

286
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,690
can imagine that you can get like a

287
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,450
straight rectangle from the webcam on

288
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,480
the drawing itself then you feature

289
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,130
background foreground image itself um

290
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,720
then you get separation between the

291
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,610
color depending on the game you want to

292
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,920
have depending on the felt pain you have

293
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,240
at hand on everything you can select

294
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,070
actually the kind of region you want to

295
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,910
you want to user then you get just

296
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,100
cultural selection in the end and from

297
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,720
the controls then you can get a more

298
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,850
interesting description of the shape

299
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,760
itself for instance just a matter of is

300
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,050
it a dot

301
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,110
is it a line is it a loop is already

302
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,680
huge again play wise we wanted to spend

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,940
a lot of time actually to get very

304
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,460
precise description of the drawing but

305
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,440
it didn't really matter much at first it

306
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,170
was really was just very simple very

307
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,030
simple description it was only very

308
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,010
easily enough you can imagine if you

309
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,480
have four colors and four description

310
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,580
it's I mean it gets communitary so you

311
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,440
have a lot of possibilities already and

312
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,520
if you need to explain to someone for

313
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,360
two hours every stuff about the drawing

314
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,710
and every stuff about like the shapes

315
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,300
and all that and when it creates for the

316
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,670
gameplay it gives a bit the idea of

317
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,710
being able to just go and play with it

318
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,690
it's why it was very important for us

319
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,880
for instance for the pinball one to get

320
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,240
a set of Colossus was coherent for

321
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,500
instance if you had two blue you had

322
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,030
either the walls or the flipper which

323
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,490
was wasn't very physical shapes so you

324
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,960
could expect what would be happening

325
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,089
this was aware as this kind of mix

326
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,490
between I will try to be very precise

327
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,500
because I know a lot about the graphical

328
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,420
language and I don't know much but I

329
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,310
know I can explore and I can try out and

330
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,320
discover new stuff with like superpower

331
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,170
you just discover bits by bits by just

332
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,180
running around sometimes get surprised

333
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,580
it's a bit of a mess you correct and

334
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,589
then you get like you you learn

335
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,070
something new

336
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,170
now at the southern part was it about

337
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,960
game designing in perception the point

338
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,600
is that as I told you already you create

339
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,120
the game itself before playing it so you

340
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
always you always have this loop about

341
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,370
being a designer and being a player

342
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,900
which is pretty fun because technically

343
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,730
when you create finds on the pinball

344
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,710
stuff we are game designer designer and

345
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,600
when we create the library we are game

346
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,120
designer designer designer so bit meta

347
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,630
but still the point is that is you have

348
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,850
a way this loop being creating and

349
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,140
playing and for us it was always meant

350
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,650
to be seen as one meanings that you play

351
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,720
you create your pinball you play it and

352
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,200
you realize that I made a mistake here

353
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,700
and you collect it and you play it again

354
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,260
and you collect it and this way it's

355
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,090
kind of loop so it was not about playing

356
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,220
it was not just about creating it was

357
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,540
both has won in the end one time we had

358
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,240
an issue with a controller meaning is

359
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,310
that in the end he had there was a bit

360
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,770
like that the people will be here with

361
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,050
the drawing so basically more or less be

362
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,840
fair to them signatures for instance so

363
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,660
just film it here six two four one trip

364
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,300
in order to play and then collect at the

365
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,050
drawing nobody would collect the drawing

366
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,680
a new say as I could but nobody did that

367
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
because it was too far a challenge and

368
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,610
the loop was destroyed it was I'm not in

369
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,500
the mood and it's not at first of course

370
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,750
we like you and it was a huge criticism

371
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,950
to do that but it's pretty coherent in

372
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,680
the end it's like it's not because in

373
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,600
this case you could switch from one side

374
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,430
to the other one when for instance

375
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,060
you're on the free paper itself I mean

376
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,890
you're there you play and then you Joe

377
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,320
and you don't change role somehow so the

378
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,560
switch the cognitive load about

379
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,930
switching is way way each and then you

380
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,400
become both of the same time so that's

381
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,780
that was pretty fun

382
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,480
sorry I forgot Heidi slide to explain it

383
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,339
even better anyway you really have this

384
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,380
so yeah I don't repeat everything I've

385
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,270
said for the last two minutes so there

386
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,570
you go the designer and the pair itself

387
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,870
so as I said before everybody knows how

388
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,150
to do all and everybody loves to the

389
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,550
dough it's fun you just do whatever you

390
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,880
want it's free and all that but Indian

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,190
actually I realized that when I was

392
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,830
writing is this slider so for very long

393
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,310
time as you can expect everybody loves

394
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,740
to be very small it's true but everybody

395
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,750
doesn't love to doodle in front of other

396
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,830
people especially when we try to expose

397
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,020
the other drawing and we do export the

398
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,270
worst one we expose like the we exhibits

399
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,520
the one draw pretty nice and people have

400
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,339
a huge like pressure about I won't be

401
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,440
able to do the same stuff as that and I

402
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,589
will do is I will try it and and it's

403
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,110
usually how to make people draw by

404
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,630
themselves but in this case we have a

405
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,610
motivation to do so because then again

406
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,970
it's not just a drawing it's not just

407
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,240
again it's both thank you

408
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,660
so it's both the point is that at first

409
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,150
when people say I don't know what to

410
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,220
drop so okay don't go then it's like you

411
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,540
know how to play pinball you like it

412
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,730
yeah then play it and at first you have

413
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,800
like a blank screen she just launched

414
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,449
the ball and you have like little people

415
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,010
on the side you launch the ball and game

416
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,520
over

417
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,690
this was fun right on the sides some

418
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,450
kind of blue balls and then tada tada

419
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,020
like the person is starting to draw

420
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,940
already and of course then he launched

421
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,890
the ball and the game is very boring

422
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,350
sand okay let me add something and it's

423
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,360
done it's like if you'll not really into

424
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,429
gaming but you like you like drawings

425
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,560
and you will enter the staff games

426
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,120
through drawing if you don't like

427
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,980
drawing if you like drawing but you're

428
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,530
not really at ease drawing and you have

429
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,290
no starting point it's like what do I

430
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,410
draw what do I do

431
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,480
like it's very hard then you have like

432
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,950
reasons from the game design to actually

433
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,390
SH and chose a spacer and of course this

434
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,060
is true as a as a starting point but the

435
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,980
end point is to get this kind of result

436
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,100
being a game and a drawing if you

437
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,490
remember the red stuff is bumpers that

438
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,830
actually explode them meaning that you

439
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,480
destroy something you can go through so

440
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,310
basically you have a bus you can like

441
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,200
destroy the octopus kind of thing and

442
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,630
then just reach new heights on it so you

443
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,910
can really play and on the game design

444
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,430
to animate the drawing in a very

445
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,320
different way anyway I'm using an image

446
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,140
but it's not true because animation will

447
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,900
be something that would be like a not

448
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,760
static but like having just flat linear

449
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,680
in time and in case it's not that it

450
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,740
would be like no again drawing something

451
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,480
like that so it's pretty fun to play

452
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,540
with and we have the right to the

453
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:04,100
picture we don't this guy in enhanced

454
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,870
infest very nice event

455
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,190
thank you Tom and actually also a white

456
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,770
polo shirt with the three colors we are

457
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:23,630
using at the time when I was telling you

458
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,550
about like a real life and all that did

459
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,670
we always be surprised by this is one of

460
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,400
them actually it's the guy just like

461
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
Hardesty shirt and you could do that and

462
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,980
because we're not very specific I can

463
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,660
give you his number if you want to if

464
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,190
you're not too specific actually if

465
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,080
you're fuzzy and this is the keyboard to

466
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,020
about messiness know the matter now that

467
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,110
if you're fuzzy about everything then

468
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,070
you can get this kind of Orion results

469
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,970
and this kind of good results

470
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,500
we always wanted to play

471
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,380
with your food so quickly what you have

472
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,300
here is an economy a quiche for those

473
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,260
that don't know it's some kind of

474
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,630
Japanese pancake Pizza mashup let's say

475
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,680
yeah here you have onions here you have

476
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,060
ginger green and red enough said

477
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,340
so they're what you get more less here

478
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,690
you have a little player so this was

479
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,700
really like cutting-edge technology and

480
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,980
I'm not referring to the knife since we

481
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,890
use chopsticks but the point was that we

482
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,420
had little players and the world the

483
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,820
stuff was you try to shoot each other

484
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,460
and to get out of the economy a key so

485
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,140
you could get the last economy a key at

486
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,780
you eat to eat this was a very stupid we

487
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,620
loved it so and that just to give you an

488
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,480
idea that cost us in a matter of time I

489
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,990
don't know what it was convenient hours

490
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,180
so like we were super busy during we

491
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,100
have super busy doing this and doing the

492
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,840
week we are we created that any of that

493
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,210
sometimes that ah let's do that because

494
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,470
it's easy when you have like the library

495
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,240
and all that and we have the kids too

496
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,090
it's easy to recreate everything I mean

497
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,340
it's easy to use that to create any kind

498
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,140
of new games you would want either from

499
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,920
doing or just from colors so very

500
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,500
quickly to even part is like people

501
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,870
cartridge meaning that you can just like

502
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,270
take another drawing use it here change

503
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,070
it from one game to another and this

504
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,320
idea of copy pasting or cutting and

505
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,600
pasting yep you can use it too so you

506
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
can really cut one one one level design

507
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
and put on another one and you have

508
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,840
interesting mashup and one last point to

509
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,190
introduce even more on the fuzzy

510
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,000
gameplay would be that at first for us

511
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,070
the few papers it kind of game where one

512
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,800
person game slag always confused getting

513
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,420
design you can play a very important sub

514
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,300
subject and topic and all that but no at

515
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,630
some point we got five people coming on

516
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,670
an exhibition one game starting to plate

517
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,040
the other one act bumping him and using

518
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,810
like the other

519
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,670
the other button so you already two

520
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,820
players or two or two two people playing

521
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,960
then you had all the other friends

522
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,090
taking every I mean each one sells pain

523
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,710
and trying to draw everything to just

524
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,690
like mess with the other player and then

525
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,400
you go you have some kind of fuzzy

526
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,410
multiplayer not really multiplayer but

527
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,680
not really one player either and

528
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,360
discomfiture X and that we don't expect

529
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,500
her first like no don't do is that do

530
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,290
that it's a very good idea so that's the

531
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,510
point of it you can we get surprised by

532
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,300
the results and I wish I could say that

533
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,590
we were surprised when you're ago but

534
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,240
now we learn everything and we are on

535
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,640
top of it of course not we always gets a

536
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,990
surprise from the players themselves

537
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,100
interesting point that could be another

538
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,680
topic itself is why do you play very

539
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,780
quickly if you look at other games or

540
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,170
the way of of play and all that you see

541
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,300
that you try to reach a better score you

542
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,850
try to kill the last boss you just want

543
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,080
to finish this level and you have

544
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,440
excuses to play like why do you play

545
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,750
white tonight do you want to play your

546
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,060
anymore PG for instance because my link

547
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,910
needs me like really like your friends

548
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,160
needs you it's not because it's fun this

549
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,900
is boring you know it's reminds you of a

550
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,350
job and of course it is still fun but if

551
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,180
you ask what you are playing you will

552
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,310
not get excuses then just because I love

553
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,560
it because it's fun and in this case

554
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,970
since you're designing the game since

555
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,830
the kind of the idea of a score doesn't

556
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,640
matter anymore

557
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,340
you lose this kind of excuses and you

558
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,140
see some kind of almost angst sometime

559
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,850
which are pretty fun to you to see not

560
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,430
for the players but for us at least when

561
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,320
do realize like okay I'm stuck I created

562
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,940
the game I played it it's very fun but

563
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,000
what next

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,460
so in your case what's next would be you

565
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,850
who created the tag who created the

566
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,310
little bit and all that we do workshops

567
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,380
now we try to share knowledge about it

568
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,530
to talk about it and if you want to

569
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,200
participate with us please we love to

570
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,790
share the point source library and all

571
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,170
that and to get new players and

572
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,310
designers thanks a lot

573
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,440
[Applause]

574
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:36,160
one question we're a bit shy because

575
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,040
your first time for us for now we share

576
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,160
it let's demand somehow slightly because

577
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,590
we want you we know that the best way to

578
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,570
kill in a person's project is to release

579
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,590
a bad card that we just make people not

580
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,630
want to come back to it so we are did

581
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,970
shy about how much here also how much

582
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,430
about touches let's say we have in Okada

583
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,470
and we'd love actually suggesting you

584
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,710
new people to explore it already so we

585
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,890
are very good to share it and hopefully

586
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,300
in the upcoming the couple of monsters

587
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,460
it should be any trouble and this

588
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,600
process will be fastened as much as we

589
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,130
can find people to actually try it out

590
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,490
already

591
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,220
