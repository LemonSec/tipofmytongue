1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,030
oh let's do this so I can keep track of

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,730
where I am awesome so thanks for showing

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,570
up today

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,360
my name is Robinson Tryon I currently

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,780
work for the lot Network which is a

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,960
entity nonprofit that helps deal with

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,970
patent trolls and I've worked in various

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,490
other capabilities worked on Libre

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,700
Office worked on some neat midday today

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,800
metadata games collecting information

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,649
for archived for archives and libraries

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,550
and I'm based in Dallas Texas which is

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,620
lots of fun for giving talks about

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,989
patents because the patent capital the

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,719
worlds in East Texas Marshall Texas is

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
basically two hours due east of me so

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,499
this wasn't planned I didn't I moved

18
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:53,789
there first and then got this job's done

19
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,999
for this presentation should play people

20
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:59,579
oh look at the time as well I wanted to

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,039
kind of just look at what's going on

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,739
patents in the US and Europe talk about

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
what's happening and a lot of stuff is

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,520
happening a lot of amazing things are

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,549
happening and keep all of you guys awake

26
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,100
but Wellcome you're yawning so I'll have

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,390
to work on that and just talk about a

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,590
patent strategy for businesses so I

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,119
originally had like a 20 minute talk I

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,409
think I really get more time so

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,079
hopefully I did not expand my slides too

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,289
much we'll see how I zoomed through so

33
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,590
I'm not a lawyer not your lawyer all the

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,420
normal stuff applies but hopefully you

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,560
guys have a little familiar with law and

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,509
patents and it sort of jumped through

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,369
things I know a couple you guys are

38
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,320
lawyers many of the lawyers at all

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,409
couple all right so I do apologize if I

40
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,840
say things or think things seem overly

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,280
simple to you because I have wanted to

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,020
sort of discuss some topics and talk

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,789
about some things that I learned about I

44
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:57,000
didn't know a lot about regarding legal

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,560
issues in the U and in United States so

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,689
let's begin when I started researching

47
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,130
these systems I I didn't really

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,439
understand the total impacts of events

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,179
and how that would affect patent systems

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,860
and how they affect litigation and so

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,959
forth so I sort of started at sort of a

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,209
narrower view and that really expanded

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,370
that grew into

54
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,090
looking at sort of the amazing change

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,599
that administrative change a leader like

56
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,980
a new present United States can have so

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,260
I found that very interesting and I hope

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,849
that you guys will as well so the crux

59
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,500
of my talk I think was about preparing

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,720
free norms both free and open source

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,700
software companies to deal with patents

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,060
to actually sort of give you guys

63
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,470
Tibbett of in from Tibbett some

64
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,840
information about how you can look at

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,910
patent the patent sphere you can look at

66
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,250
litigation and get a handle on what's

67
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,239
going on and what's gonna come next

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,890
because I think that's really important

69
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,239
to see what's going to come next what

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,489
the future of patents on the future of

71
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,480
patentability is some patent strategies

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,799
some ways of dealing with patents are of

73
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,890
course smarter than others but what I

74
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,060
found very interesting is that there are

75
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,349
a lot of companies a lot of startups out

76
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,660
there who basically have no plan about

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,760
dealing with patents and whether they

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,970
are starting some hardware or software

79
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,549
it Hardware more than then software but

80
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,060
a large number of startups both in the

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,950
free software space and not they don't

82
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,090
really think about patents they sort of

83
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,950
push it off and I think that's the wrong

84
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,540
strategy I think it's something that we

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,609
need to think about early on so that we

86
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,139
don't back ourselves into a corner so

87
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,440
that we have ability to reduce our risk

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,000
and to make smart decisions so educating

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,590
yourself of course is the most important

90
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,420
thing it doesn't hurt to educate

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,799
yourself on legal systems beyond your

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,630
own I remember when I learned French for

93
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,639
the first time I had no idea what the

94
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,079
imperfect was I had no idea what these

95
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,579
other things were I used it in English

96
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,340
I used it concepts but it was by

97
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,200
learning other systems by being able to

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,940
compare and contrast that then you can

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,069
actually have a greater understanding of

100
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,459
your system so it slings and arrows so

101
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,160
one really interesting lawsuit that I

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,359
thought was it was a great place to

103
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,130
start in terms of litigation as there

104
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,609
was a guy in a pasture who liked to LARP

105
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,430
he liked to shoot people with arrows and

106
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,310
these were foam tipped arrows right so

107
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,470
no death but he started selling these

108
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,599
things online and he expanded his

109
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,310
business and he started to import arrows

110
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,849
from as it turns out European country so

111
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,310
we have this US and Europe already

112
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,990
involved here so

113
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,030
there is a company that sued him for

114
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,380
patent and trademark infringement

115
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,240
because they want to make sure they got

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,430
everything and they cleared claim that

117
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,229
the errors he was selling infringed on

118
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,449
patents that they had filed for their

119
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,229
own hardware for their own for their own

120
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,780
game there was error game and they told

121
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,880
him probably was a little bit of

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
bragging and hopefully to scare him that

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,699
they had set aside a hundred fifty

124
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,819
thousand dollars - and he was definitely

125
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,560
timid aided by that so he didn't really

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,020
have any money he was again he's a

127
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,789
pastor a youth pastor I didn't a lot of

128
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,789
money so he turned to go fund me and

129
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,960
asked others in the in his community

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,729
which could be very similar to say the

131
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,289
free and open source software community

132
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,900
to help him defend against this

133
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,320
particular case and in response to that

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,789
glory his company tried to get a gag

135
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,070
order to stop talking about this so

136
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,419
basically they you know kind of

137
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,949
ratcheted things up and thankfully were

138
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,310
unsuccessful what was what really was

139
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,370
great for him was that after the suit

140
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,509
came out Newegg who is a very very

141
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,940
strong stance against patent trolls step

142
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,949
forward to help him and in fact they had

143
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,280
been selling these t-shirts for Hunter

144
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,050
t-shirts and they said it's like ten

145
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,940
thousand dollars from that to help him -

146
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,580
for him for his for his lawsuit to

147
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,320
defend defend against this Pendrell

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,219
lawsuit so Newegg leeching is chief

149
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,680
counsel there and in fact knew and lee

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,870
chang are involved in the lot network as

151
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,759
well who I work for

152
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,759
again with patent trolls Chang basically

153
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,050
said and he he went a little further

154
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,150
than I might have been he said that this

155
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,440
company even though they sell products

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
he said you know they're basically a

157
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,280
troll because they're asserting question

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,520
why P they're aggressive and he went on

159
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,830
and on you can read but he basically

160
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,280
laid into them and what was what was

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,870
really important I think about this is

162
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,810
that after Chang and Newegg signed on

163
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,479
has this sort of champion global dropped

164
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,460
its case global finally knowledge there

165
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,310
was prior art from Germany that that had

166
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,860
been created in the past and they

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,690
basically dropped the lawsuit in fact

168
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,849
they don't drop a lawsuit they

169
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,849
they basically they immediately drop the

170
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,309
lawsuit to basically avoid having her

171
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,409
own IP and validated so they kind of did

172
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,999
a really quick shuffle so what I think

173
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,229
was really important about this case

174
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,189
even though it's not about free and

175
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,240
restore software it's in a slightly

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,759
different realm is that not everyone has

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,159
a champion so in different spheres not

178
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,270
one has a champion which means that

179
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,159
you'll it's important for you to set

180
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,080
yourself up for success it's important

181
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,599
for you to have a patent policy and

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,949
whether that's making friends whether

183
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,979
that's joining a group like the lot

184
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,719
network open adventure network you

185
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,179
should have a patent policy and an IP

186
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,159
policy sooner the better

187
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:22,830
so you know what well I thought was

188
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,360
especially saying even though he had

189
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,849
strong prior art he wasn't able to shake

190
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,289
velocity because he wasn't a lawyer he

191
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,199
didn't have that background so don't

192
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,479
overestimate a wealthy plaintiff people

193
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,559
have big war chests so I with that in

194
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,879
mind thinking about the little guy the

195
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,159
big guy I want to kind of look at the

196
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,439
European Union in US patent systems and

197
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,059
think about what courts look like in the

198
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,009
future what relationships will exist

199
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,819
between countries and so forth so the

200
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,740
UPC do you guys call that a UPC and

201
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,439
Europe as well okay good I saw that now

202
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,959
when I first heard UPC it it kept on

203
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,159
running me so I had to throw in there

204
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,319
it's a proposed court open to all

205
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,449
members of the EU but it's not a part of

206
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,889
the EU I was a little confused about

207
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,589
that but it was important to look at

208
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,259
this because basically the UPC as I

209
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,180
understand it would supersede a lot of

210
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,649
the other courts would collect all of

211
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,319
the patent cases especially software

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,729
patent cases into one court that would

213
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,289
apply to all these European Union member

214
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,559
countries and deal with infringement and

215
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,059
as well as the site about unitary

216
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,979
patents so kind of like a you know

217
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,639
pan-european file at once run everywhere

218
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,229
java I think Java patent but there was a

219
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,578
great talk last year if you guys want to

220
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,438
learn more about it please take a look

221
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,000
at that here's really quickly some

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,519
concerns that that were raised last year

223
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,569
about it and I think are still relevant

224
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:49,110
it's a pro patent court is he claimed

225
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,240
basically because all they do is patents

226
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,730
so me would sort of get into their brain

227
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,589
there are similar claims made for court

228
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,120
in United States Court a bill to the

229
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,259
Federal Circuit

230
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,249
the DEA's patent not all they do is

231
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,379
patents but largely of the engage with a

232
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,549
lot of patent work and so there are four

233
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,699
patents on the brain some other issues

234
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,799
there's no appeals court so in the

235
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,879
United States there's a court the

236
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,769
Supreme Court United States that reviews

237
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,709
the other courts decisions and hopefully

238
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,419
inject some sanity basically to those

239
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,529
who deal with patents all the time

240
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,789
there's nothing to to override that

241
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,289
there's a pro software patent tradition

242
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,720
from Germany and it's independent from

243
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,279
the EU which makes it a little bit weird

244
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,850
and patents are only translate into a

245
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,539
few languages so basically in you know

246
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,769
we could go through these individually

247
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,479
but basically this sums up to is that

248
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:43,009
the UPC will be a very unfriendly place

249
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,939
before dealing with patents especially

250
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,779
software patents and I think that if

251
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,669
enacted would be a very unhealthy

252
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,809
development for free software but I

253
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,939
guess thankfully it doesn't exist yet

254
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,589
basically the UK and Germany both have

255
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,289
to sign and then the brexit happened so

256
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,879
what if the brexit means is very

257
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,829
interesting and again when the lawyers

258
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,480
out there might wave your hand

259
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,889
insistently that's great you can correct

260
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,959
me but as I understand one of the

261
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,720
problems is that basically the brexit

262
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,609
right now in short term won't have any

263
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,369
major impacts on patent in the European

264
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,739
Union but after the UK leaves EU it

265
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:23,819
won't be under the jurisdiction that you

266
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,289
courts and it can't be a member of the

267
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:29,069
proposed UPC but for the UPC to exist it

268
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,109
needs to have written and needs to have

269
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,579
Germany ratified

270
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,709
so this is an issue with what's going on

271
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,679
right now so in fact the UK

272
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,329
theoretically is leaving said we're

273
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,980
gonna we're gonna leave don't worry but

274
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,589
we're gonna ratify this first so that's

275
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:44,759
cool but I'm gonna ratify and then they

276
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,039
leave but the problem with that is that

277
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,809
the UPC is designed and I might be

278
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,579
jumping ahead here for a second but

279
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,769
basically so the UK said yes you know as

280
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,149
long as we're members of the EU we're

281
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,739
gonna participate we're gonna be a part

282
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,369
of this but the issue with this is that

283
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,559
UPC is supposed to be only you members

284
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,230
so if Britain signs on to it and then

285
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,529
they leave then they're a part of the

286
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:11,580
UPC but they can't

287
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,470
be a part of the UPC this is very

288
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,230
confusing so for me he's some scholars

289
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,250
have said there's a convoluted way

290
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,500
around this well to sort of summarize

291
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,030
that that means for anybody else who has

292
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,650
to deal with patent soon anyone else who

293
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,170
has to deal with these courts or has to

294
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,480
try to make some type of patent strategy

295
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
of the future

296
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,310
it's very imperiled it's very difficult

297
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,290
so in essence this is one more reason

298
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,080
why having a patent strategy having at

299
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,550
least a lawyer you can talk to to give

300
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,200
you some advice in these situations is

301
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,790
very important I'm sure that this is

302
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,300
going to change in the next few months

303
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,700
continually of course many people in the

304
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,280
UK kind of like the idea of leaving

305
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,400
without joining the UPC because it is

306
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,900
ostensibly such a pro software patent

307
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,700
Court so what would happen in the UK

308
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,440
without the UPC basically my

309
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,660
understanding is that it would be a

310
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,010
little bit more free software friendly

311
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,060
basically the UK has a slightly smaller

312
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,830
scope of patentability than what is

313
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,560
currently present so summarize basically

314
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,850
that it would be a little bit better for

315
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,440
free software in Britain so the United

316
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,930
States this one this part is exciting so

317
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,450
on what's going on under Obama there was

318
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,090
the American Invents Act there were some

319
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,270
really great parts parts of that act

320
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,500
that enabled people to work on that sort

321
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,450
of getting rid of bad patents before

322
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,210
they were while they're being filed so

323
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,770
any you guys involved with Linux

324
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,230
defenders and even guys involved with

325
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,050
basically getting rid these patents No

326
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,270
okay so basically it was working with

327
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,100
prior art it was basically a way in

328
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,860
which various members of the community

329
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,480
with legal background often but not

330
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
necessarily could help to basically tell

331
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,220
the Patent Office hey this is a bad

332
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,470
patent haterz prior art so this is

333
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,640
definitely I think something that

334
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,620
company should think about especially if

335
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,670
they're operating a certain space

336
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,520
databases virtualization etc this is

337
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,170
something that is it is really important

338
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,030
I'm not sure if there's something

339
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,000
parallel in Europe right now but it

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,740
would be great to have an ability for

341
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,840
someone to say hey someone's trying to

342
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
file a patent on XYZ and we have

343
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,180
XYY it's really close to that and this

344
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,650
is something that should be reviewed so

345
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,940
that's something that should be a part

346
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,170
of your Pratt patent strategy what can

347
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,450
we expect under Trump so what's in

348
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,010
really much information in her trunk

349
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,080
it's kind of exciting

350
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,960
IP was in a primary focus everyone

351
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,060
online all of the articles I've been

352
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,920
reading the research I've done says

353
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,450
everyone is excited about writing

354
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,010
articles about it but they wishbone you

355
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,470
know they just like to talk a lot so so

356
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,450
what we do know his he had an uncle

357
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,490
actually was interesting Lee who won a

358
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,140
Presidential Medal of Freedom who was an

359
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,610
inventor at MIT and did a lot of really

360
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,090
neat stuff so he had a cool uncle so he

361
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,280
can be we can be happy about that

362
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
he has criticized some companies and

363
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,690
because of his business and and his

364
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,190
behavior I think that you know the

365
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,400
United States we're gonna see a policy

366
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,930
emerge that's gonna be more patent

367
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,820
friendly more living you know front

368
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,260
litigious friendly

369
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,270
and probably about the only thing

370
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,800
certain about in this presentation he's

371
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,450
gonna tweet about it so so who's in

372
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,700
charge in the United States there's

373
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,870
currently someone called Michelle Lee

374
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,800
she was important appointed under Obama

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,270
Peter Thiel if anyone knows who he is

376
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,590
she actually went to a Stanford Law at

377
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,750
the same time so I love all these

378
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,940
interesting connections people in the

379
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,110
same classes at the same time so she has

380
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,950
been active actually there's rumors that

381
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,930
she's staying on but it's very unclear

382
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,510
right now she was previously working at

383
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,890
Google and she pushed her a lot of

384
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,640
patent reform

385
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,320
so probably the lawyers in here know

386
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,820
what some of these things are the rest

387
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,340
of you Google is your friend interesting

388
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,290
things she worked on enhancing patent

389
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,730
quality this enhanced an equality

390
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,690
initiative which was was great one time

391
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,680
when basically there was an

392
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,510
acknowledgment that poor quality patents

393
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,910
had come out of patent office

394
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,980
she implement this inter partes review

395
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,040
which helped to deal with trolls was in

396
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,180
in was hopes to be a better way a

397
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,010
cheaper more accurate way to deal with

398
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,970
patent quality deal with patents rather

399
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:36,460
than having

400
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,040
about them and she even floated the idea

401
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,810
of putting them to forum shopping so

402
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,420
when I mentioned about this eastern

403
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,430
Texas Court which some of you might be

404
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,080
familiar with where all the patent troll

405
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,370
activity happens in United States

406
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,290
she was hopefully gonna put an end of

407
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,160
that so largely I would say she was a

408
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,710
friend to free software it's unclear

409
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,300
she's gonna continue as director it's

410
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,190
all big question mark which isn't a huge

411
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,150
surprise and under Trump's presidency

412
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,850
but we are awaiting so so who might

413
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,260
replace her so this is sort of the

414
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,990
kicker I think Phillip Johnson possibly

415
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,190
could replace her he was someone who

416
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,710
Trump vetted not sure he's not Trump

417
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,930
Obama vetted but tech companies didn't

418
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,570
like him and if he or someone like him

419
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,120
were to become the head of the Patent

420
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,190
Office this could have a huge impact on

421
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,610
patents in the United States you can you

422
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,310
can see here he was like legislation

423
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,530
that would require details about patent

424
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,270
infringement he opposed transparency

425
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,710
requirements and he he basically wanted

426
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,620
you know less less regulation so this

427
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,740
could be a this could be a big change in

428
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,210
any step backwards all you would say I'm

429
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,010
the way patents are handled in the

430
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,310
United States so so the cost of a patent

431
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,940
troll suit so if you've ever been sued

432
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,980
by patent troll I apologize

433
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,100
and hopefully that you got through it

434
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,880
pretty much unscathed

435
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,020
if you were a small company you probably

436
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,089
didn't survive you can think you know

437
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,490
3.3 million I just was talking to my

438
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,530
cousin who has a small start-up and I'm

439
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,140
pretty sure that that is about at least

440
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,640
three times them money they currently

441
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,500
have in the bank

442
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,750
so basically patent the patent lawsuit

443
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,520
is in the United States I'm where most

444
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,700
of my numbers usually cost about 1/2

445
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,609
million in legal fees and a little bit

446
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,620
more in licensing cost or basically if

447
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,230
you have to pay off you know that is

448
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,810
troll unfortunately in these troll cases

449
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,050
small companies bear a large amount of

450
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,600
the money and it makes sense I mean you

451
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,070
know in a crude crude way not in a good

452
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,400
way

453
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,410
but basically patent trolls go after the

454
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,910
weak of the flock right who's the weak

455
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,710
of the flock it's gonna be the young the

456
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,480
startups and so forth

457
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,270
was unfortunate but it's it it's a

458
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,700
predator-prey relationship so if you

459
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,190
work in hardware hopefully you guys

460
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,770
don't you're gonna pay a lot more

461
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,150
licensing going to be many millions

462
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,650
eight million for example let's say an

463
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,419
average right you could be could be much

464
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:09,070
higher so on the in the realm of

465
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,820
hardware basically there there are a lot

466
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,110
of are places where patents can be

467
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,610
regularly United States and what is in

468
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,190
the FTC on the Federal Trade Commission

469
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,530
so just before Trump took office office

470
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,830
the FTC sued Qualcomm accusing them of

471
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,440
unfair competition I'm claiming they

472
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,230
violated Frane licensing that they

473
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,230
basically were bundling hardware and

474
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,320
patent licenses exclusively and had some

475
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,660
exclusive deals with Apple and the this

476
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,400
is something that T C does again like

477
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,850
the United States Patent Office it is

478
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,710
part of what they do in terms of in

479
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,400
terms of regulating trade but a lot of

480
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,980
people are very concerned because this

481
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,419
this review could have had a big impact

482
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:59,380
on how hardware companies regulate how

483
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,910
hardware companies sell their products

484
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,740
how they might bundle patent licenses

485
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,540
with hardware for example something that

486
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,309
is of great concern to the free software

487
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,590
community Qualcomm found this it's

488
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,510
really amusing Qualcomm announced an

489
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,059
open-source it city or in 2009 and if

490
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,470
any of you guys have know about and all

491
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,510
about Qualcomm if you don't and this is

492
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,160
I think kind of telling you know proudly

493
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,870
proclaim Qualcomm gets an open source

494
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,990
and pigs begin to fly so basically not a

495
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,600
big fan historically of open source free

496
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,440
software so what might happen or onder

497
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,770
Trump so a lot of people have asked a

498
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,450
lot of conservative groups have asked

499
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,990
Trump's to stop the FTC's action and the

500
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,890
effect that could have sort of the

501
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,650
knock-on effect is that you know it

502
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,900
could it could basically change how we

503
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,590
see antitrust basically fair trade thing

504
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,260
fair trade happening United States which

505
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,820
could affect a lot of free software

506
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,299
companies so the FTC decided to file the

507
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:04,810
suit broke down on party lines basically

508
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,260
and the perks of the chair you can see

509
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,170
there who voted for this resigned in

510
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,180
February yeah actually that resigned yet

511
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,830
because were designed in a couple of

512
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,010
days the lone dissenter has been

513
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,520
appointed to chair at the FTC and with

514
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,940
this change it's quite likely the FTC

515
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,880
excuse me will give more broad

516
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,570
permission to companies like Qualcomm to

517
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,860
basically increase their there their

518
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,290
patent litigation Wellhausen excuse me

519
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,410
is it's critical of net neutrality and

520
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,240
of regulation in general I think this is

521
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,380
sort of a common thread that we're gonna

522
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,810
see throughout change and the

523
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:56,220
administration regarding Obama's FTC

524
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,620
excuse me she said it with one that

525
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,970
pursued antitrust agenda there's

526
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,760
disregarded sound economics basically

527
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,410
made unsupported assertions of unfair

528
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,700
competition so basically she's expected

529
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,690
call excuse me Qualcomm excuse me more

530
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,580
flexibility and how it capitalizes on

531
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,470
its assets so she also discussed PA es

532
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,950
or patent trolls in her talk and she

533
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,830
said that patent these patent trolls

534
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,120
have become the boogeyman of the patent

535
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,030
world and she worried that patent form

536
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,880
would have harmed us innovation so it's

537
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,260
unclear what action she's gonna take

538
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,890
about patent trolls but basically it's

539
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,660
highly unlikely for freedoms or software

540
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,580
companies to see meaningful patent

541
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,230
reform over the next four years reducing

542
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,310
risk so excuse me no matter who you are

543
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,440
as a company no matter you're working

544
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,200
for and whatever you're the size of your

545
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,960
holdings any company can be seriously

546
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,760
challenged by a patent suit they seen

547
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,860
this happen with Google and Oracle we've

548
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,650
seen this happen with Apple and and and

549
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,240
lawsuits it's faced in several times

550
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,160
over the last few years so no patent

551
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,630
strategy is bulletproof but there are

552
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,490
many approaches to reducing risk so one

553
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,659
which I

554
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,609
find kind of novel but I think is good

555
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,619
as sort of a baseline thought process is

556
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,840
that patent trolls if we look at petrels

557
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,249
themselves they don't produce goods they

558
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:25,690
don't sell services and they don't

559
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,279
participate in collaborative behaviors

560
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,009
and by doing this they basically have no

561
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,440
surface to sue there's no no that

562
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,470
nothing to go after so most companies do

563
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,970
in fact need to produce goods or

564
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,210
services to stay in business but

565
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,529
avoiding certain activities or at least

566
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:44,259
thinking about what activities might be

567
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,210
the most likely target for a troll or

568
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,979
for patent litigation is a useful

569
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,899
exercise when you're developing patent

570
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:52,950
strategy and that can reduce your risk

571
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,019
there are a number of entities a number

572
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:57,429
of groups as I mentioned they open

573
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:58,690
invention Network I think some of you

574
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,519
are familiar with them that can reduce

575
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,200
your risk in patent litigation the lock

576
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,899
network who I work for is a

577
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,369
collaborative solution to dealing with

578
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,779
patent trolls can also reduce your

579
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,009
patent risk and the open patent office

580
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:19,479
is Frederick Wistia here hello so he has

581
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,220
a I want to further sin here because I

582
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,399
saw it on the on the slate his talk is

583
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,149
coming up next

584
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,879
so he'll doing a talk about this right

585
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:30,129
right afterwards so stick around and you

586
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,200
can learn a bit more about how this is

587
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,419
an alternative to traditional patent

588
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,159
office and make it a work out well as

589
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,299
part of your patent strategy there are a

590
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,970
lot of other strategies the ffs created

591
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,409
document called hacking patent system

592
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,389
guide to alternative patent license for

593
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:48,729
innovators not sure what happened with

594
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:52,090
that I think maybe a HTML that's a it's

595
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,799
a hyperlink there and if you knocked out

596
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,859
my last bullet point but this is a guide

597
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,929
think it's a couple of years old but it

598
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,149
talks about a lot of different groups

599
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:08,080
that are either patent pool a patent

600
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,619
grant entity a alternative to

601
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,119
traditional patent licensing for example

602
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,799
so there are a lot of different

603
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,229
strategies you can just pile up in the

604
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:19,539
FF website for that document and we'll

605
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:22,470
give you a lot of different types of

606
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,269
groups or strategies you could use to

607
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,989
shape a your patent strategy for your

608
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,000
freedoms or so

609
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,390
and source software business so I wanted

610
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,610
to look at I just one more patent suit

611
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,020
that I thought was instructive that was

612
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,150
interesting and

613
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,160
pertaining to freedoms or software so

614
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,800
Christopher how many you guys familiar

615
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,450
with biotechnology and CRISPR heard

616
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,790
about this per a few of you so it's it's

617
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,110
basically this technique and by in

618
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,690
biotechnology

619
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,300
that allows people to manipulate DNA so

620
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,490
there is basically a significant dispute

621
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,410
all you need to know over which

622
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,060
researchers who were the originators of

623
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,500
this technique and then who should have

624
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,540
control the patents vital to this and

625
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,150
this is big business this is tens of

626
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,840
billions of dollars of business here so

627
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,010
Harvard University and the bot Institute

628
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,360
are duking it out with Berkeley

629
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,310
University and if you guys know Harvard

630
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,690
is on the East Coast and Berkeley's on

631
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,680
the West so it's kind of got this

632
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,580
east-west side view you can see Harvard

633
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,530
the last couple years - spent fifteen

634
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,340
million dollars and Berkeley's spent

635
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,750
over five million I think it's closer to

636
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,030
seven now and we're not even close to

637
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,780
being done with this suit so average

638
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,390
cost for a lawsuit like this is

639
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,650
estimated about about seven million

640
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,450
dollars so you can tell this lawsuit has

641
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,010
been much more expensive than previous

642
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,880
ones what I think was really interesting

643
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,750
about this case

644
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,390
so it's a biotech patent series of

645
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,240
biotech patents and deals with deals of

646
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,190
this technology is that CRISPR is a tool

647
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,360
for editing and rewriting DNA so it can

648
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,480
allow people to start to program in a

649
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,450
very coarse level DNA genetic code and

650
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,010
why I think this is really important to

651
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,740
us is that we're at this infancy with

652
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,290
biotech manipulation so right now we

653
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,940
have to deal with hardware patents and

654
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,650
software patents that might affect what

655
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,200
we do is free software companies and

656
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,190
there are a lot of changes happening

657
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,110
with software patents hardware patents

658
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,850
are a little more stable right now but

659
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,230
it's something that affects what

660
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,690
businesses can exist how businesses can

661
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,360
innovate how they can protect their

662
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
their inventions and what free software

663
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,970
can do in that space so we've already

664
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,440
started to see computer integration with

665
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,580
human

666
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,640
you know pacemakers insulin pumps other

667
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,190
integration but in the future we're

668
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,840
gonna see microscopic changes right

669
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,429
we're gonna see people hacking on the

670
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:56,250
DNA inside our bodies so the real

671
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,290
question of my mind in terms of patent

672
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,910
preparedness in terms of free software

673
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,559
companies taking an active part in the

674
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,090
forefront essentially of freedom in

675
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,890
programming and so forth are we prepared

676
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,080
to to safeguard this already prepared to

677
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,400
be an active member in that I think the

678
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,330
answer is not yet

679
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,549
so I think we need to become prepared

680
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,220
very soon because this is sort of one of

681
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,460
the next avenues for free software for

682
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,070
genetic freedom if you will and it's

683
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,410
something that we need to have in our

684
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,140
minds going forward so that we can make

685
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,960
smart decisions the reality is there's

686
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,130
there's no one size fits all strategy

687
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,150
dealing with patents cost companies need

688
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,669
to prepare for your individual patent

689
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,309
battles your individual cases but you

690
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,440
also need to think about larger patent

691
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,320
related topics especially ones like

692
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,809
genetic programming that have ethical

693
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,290
and economic ramifications I think that

694
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,520
it is i incumbent essentially on us

695
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,010
because of the thought that we put into

696
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,540
our businesses the thought that we put

697
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,299
into our strategies of how we design our

698
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,929
businesses and the ethics of what we do

699
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,540
with hardware and software that it's

700
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,470
important for us to think about the

701
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,049
future and think about what important

702
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,540
topics we need to stress and we needed

703
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,510
to bring to the forefront talk with

704
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,450
politicians talk with our patent courts

705
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,390
and so forth

706
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,530
most of US companies don't have large

707
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,730
legal departments they don't have a

708
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,790
large budget but learning about the PERT

709
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,220
insist UM's learning about technologies

710
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,130
is really the only strategy that will

711
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,820
bring you long-term success so any

712
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,620
questions excellent back there Oh should

713
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,918
I give you a

714
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,799
so the whole idea of patterns make me a

715
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,059
bit sick but the idea that now like take

716
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,059
from here is should I try to patent the

717
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,000
software in a bullet in a patent pool or

718
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,190
just ignore my my urges ignore that and

719
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,440
continue pushing to get hub as normal

720
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,290
yeah I mean if those are the two options

721
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,860
then I would say consider filing the

722
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,110
patent although it's expensive so III

723
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,309
think there are a lot of there are a lot

724
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,860
more options than that right so I think

725
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,130
that this idea about the open patent the

726
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,790
next talk are you put up to this no I'm

727
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,520
just joking but but yeah so I think that

728
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,260
there are a lot of other options there

729
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,200
are a lot of companies that will make

730
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,390
public disclosures right or the there

731
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,150
are yeah several mechanisms essentially

732
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,530
where you can basically file these

733
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,500
defensive publications to basically

734
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,020
describe and I think assemble them are

735
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,880
in some ways describing like a patent

736
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,130
they describe a system mechanism so

737
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,070
forth where you could basically deed

738
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,250
something to the photo domain the

739
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,460
Commons and that's probably at least a

740
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,870
cheaper way going forward but but you

741
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,190
don't get your name on a patent so you

742
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,840
know maybe you file one patent and then

743
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,710
then you have your name of a patent

744
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,280
anyone else's right there

745
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:27,919
and I so I sell license exceptions to

746
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,149
GPL as a business and I deal with mostly

747
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:34,100
us and German coverage to two biggest

748
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
customers only the u.s. actually ever

749
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,929
requested things like indemnification

750
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:42,350
not the Germans so white Autzen on that

751
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,590
and sometimes I have a bang around

752
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,549
indemnification with and two cuts my

753
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,700
outside legal counsel and then I pay

754
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,529
eventually sometimes if it's big enough

755
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:56,299
I just charge them more and then I give

756
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:58,580
up and give them the indemnification so

757
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,919
I turn over that's a good you know what

758
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,070
their thoughts on indemnification I

759
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,149
don't really have a big background with

760
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:11,090
GPL I feel like that might get a

761
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,799
question for I don't know if you want to

762
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,320
weigh in on that but um I I think it's a

763
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,659
it's interesting but I I don't know a

764
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:27,139
lot about it honestly so but what I

765
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:31,460
would ask you is I mean is it is it a

766
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,690
booming business for you you know is it

767
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:38,330
something that is so I there's a there's

768
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,549
a large business right there it's

769
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:41,929
something with with a lot of money

770
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,580
involved then I think that it's it's

771
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,309
something pertinent we should you know

772
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,690
it should be discussed rate I mean we

773
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,889
need to discuss this bigger there's

774
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,149
bigger topics especially things a big

775
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:56,350
dollar numbers attached though excellent

776
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,000
we need we need to have like a like a

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,129
volleyball like a soft volleyball do you

778
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,419
put the mic in you throw to somebody

779
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,460
John shows us today so I've got a patent

780
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:11,120
it was thank you hi there it's it's not

781
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,679
so much a question all those are I

782
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,730
suppose it it is in a way it's been a

783
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,519
long time since I study the EPC but as I

784
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,840
recall the EPC will recently included

785
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
very specific provisions in connection

786
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,600
with biotech patenting as a recall a

787
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,580
number of them came out of the oncomouse

788
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,640
and debacle so I would

789
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,429
think that the realm shall we say of

790
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,679
patenting in connection with biotech

791
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,460
inventions is probably part or possibly

792
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,760
even more fast oriented it's of ours is

793
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,700
more difficult or more stricted to

794
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,970
obtain biotech in the patents under the

795
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,820
EPC than for example software related

796
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,610
ones oh yeah I'm not as familiar with

797
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,170
that and then biotech is also not mine

798
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,410
it feels so it's Apple Bacon's away but

799
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:12,020
right there and so just a just a comment

800
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,320
really there are organizations in the

801
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,210
United States in electro property

802
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,410
organizations particularly the

803
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,059
intellectual property owners Association

804
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:21,140
and the American intellectual property

805
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,960
Law Association that are absolutely

806
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,530
horrified with the section 101 in the

807
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,850
United States which is the one that's

808
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,070
invoked for not patentable subject

809
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,590
matter sure and they're working

810
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,770
vigorously to reverse the Alice decision

811
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,110
and then the myriad decision so I just

812
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,990
wanted to point out that there is a huge

813
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,690
constituency of largely of patent

814
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,030
lawyers and patent owning companies that

815
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,070
are working vigorously to sort of

816
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:55,400
reverse the the advantages of the the

817
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,860
interpretation of patents that have been

818
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,530
advantageous to Foss but there's a very

819
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,270
large constituency working against that

820
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,500
sure yeah

821
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,840
and I guess one thing that that I find

822
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,070
interesting and maybe it's partially the

823
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,449
nature of software patents it's

824
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:11,270
partially the nature of how patents

825
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,040
apply to this space that what seems like

826
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,899
sometimes you know very small movements

827
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:20,260
on the dial and have a very large impact

828
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,750
whereas in other spaces it it seems like

829
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,040
things are much more grating they're

830
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,580
much more coarse but my new changes can

831
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,350
yeah I can have a huge impact on such a

832
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,070
vast amount of economic space so I'd

833
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,480
like to follow up with you on that Pam

834
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,739
are you suggesting that these

835
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,929
organizations are trying to to solidify

836
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,340
section 101 machine-or-transformation

837
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,449
test

838
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,609
- like validate that for software

839
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,219
yes that and and the IPO just recently

840
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,199
came out with the public I believe

841
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
someone couldn't help me out maybe here

842
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,819
was it a draft statute some draft

843
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,920
language that they wanted in order to

844
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,740
make 101 apply back again to software

845
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,079
patents or tip sort of her first the

846
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,020
effect of Allison myriad so the IPO has

847
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,790
come out with the statement a IPL a as

848
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,010
working on one right now and expect will

849
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:31,480
have it come up shortly representation

850
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,150
you mentioned you suggested to avoid but

851
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,410
the interval activities as far as

852
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,760
possible but what do you actually mean

853
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,950
by path interval activities also because

854
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,420
if if you're a company trying to

855
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,460
innovate and compete even if you're a

856
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,839
software company you do have to do

857
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,180
innovation and any I mean while some

858
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,530
part of what you do is in your free

859
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,810
software building business they say and

860
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,400
you will give it freely you might have

861
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,230
other parts of what you do which are

862
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,970
commercially you have to defend from

863
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,109
your competitors to be able to find us

864
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:00,819
as I said I you know I I feel like I can

865
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:01,960
maybe have ever written that slide

866
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,390
better I kinda you know my thinking

867
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,740
there was kind of like you know thinking

868
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,520
like the wolf but basically the patent

869
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,010
trolls I've been intrigued you know it's

870
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,450
like looking at a you stay away from

871
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,560
from Sonia I it seems like basically

872
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,240
patent trolls are very slippery right

873
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
there they're very good at basically

874
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,640
having no surface which one can use to

875
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,040
litigate against them so in that sense

876
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,230
what I was saying was it was we could

877
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,750
learn from them not necessarily by

878
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,950
following their footsteps

879
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,810
per se but learn from what they do to

880
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,589
make themselves have less of a surface

881
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:47,829
for for being having litigation and and

882
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:48,880
obviously you know if you want to

883
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,859
innovate in space and you should then

884
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,440
you can may better understand what your

885
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,810
your risk is right what your likelihood

886
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,550
of being sued is and there are a lot of

887
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,380
different entities

888
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,230
that's I mean you know purchasing some

889
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,700
I'm insurance we're that's joining a

890
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,100
patent pool and so forth to reduce your

891
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,520
your risk in that area but I think that

892
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,500
from sort of fundamental level starting

893
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,440
with the idea of yeah what is patentable

894
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,860
what will what will what it's most

895
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,710
likely for someone to seize upon and sue

896
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,960
you for what actions I think that that

897
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,720
should be a part of the equation in your

898
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,440
mental capitalist any more questions

899
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,420
comments is everyone still awake I'm

900
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:43,740
impressed I probably wouldn't be a

901
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,460
second question

902
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,920
I mean you mostly focused on patent

903
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,110
trolls but one of the reasons why you

904
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:54,300
may want to patent a company is that you

905
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,710
have commercial competitors that have

906
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,620
been attending everything they might use

907
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,450
that to actually value in court so you

908
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,950
might want to have some other patents

909
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,230
related to your same field and try to

910
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,210
negotiate something so did that make

911
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,310
sense and I mean that would does that

912
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,230
change anything if you're not getting

913
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,650
going again

914
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,320
I mean be harassed by a patent troll by

915
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,840
a competitor sure sure that's it's it's

916
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,020
a good question in in my experience a

917
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,080
lot of companies working in the free

918
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,690
software space and open source space

919
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,400
don't seek those kinds of patents

920
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,350
instead they seek relationships with

921
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,390
entities that do have patents or maybe

922
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,730
take a few of them but that that in

923
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,590
essence they they try to participate in

924
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,090
the sphere of what is patentable and

925
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,720
dealing with with patents by not being

926
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,780
as involved in that space and in seeking

927
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,260
other ways to to reduce their their risk

928
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,840
or reduce their chances of being sued so

929
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,210
of that that answer your question

930
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,359
anybody else a dying question I thought

931
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,140
okay yeah

932
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,650
[Applause]
