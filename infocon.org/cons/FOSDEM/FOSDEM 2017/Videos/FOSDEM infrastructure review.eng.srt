- Herman Richie

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,340
Richi eight will force them

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,650
infrastructure review hello everyone so

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,959
like last year this will be a short

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,600
overview of the of the actual

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,609
infrastructure a little bit of changes

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,140
and stuff what we did what we did

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,279
differently but I expect you to also

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,199
have questions because this should also

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,140
be just basically feedback what people

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,270
want to know specifically what they

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,130
might need to know for their own their

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,070
own conferences or whatever so please do

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,650
ask questions because the talk section

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,520
is not very long but the questions are

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,720
almost the most interesting thing about

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,030
this so the physical setup is pretty

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,630
much unchanged from last year we still

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,090
use the wireless access controller from

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,460
the University most of the cabling is

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,470
pre-installed we have some more upgrades

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,480
to single-mode this used to be more

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,430
fiber route we actually have more than

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,380
10 megabits going out of the U building

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,920
so that's also fine

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,270
most of the access points are PI you

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,329
will be in John saw as you probably saw

28
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:17,399
we put our own but else it's pretty much

29
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:21,390
all you'll be infrastructure and we get

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,460
some say in where we want to have

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,999
improvements over the years again this

32
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,520
time we have upstream sponsored by cult

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
we might even have two up streams next

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,920
year we hope so we have work on that we

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,539
were supposed to have this this year but

36
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:38,069
it didn't work out doesn't matter it

37
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,310
works we still have a nice r1 one

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,619
thousand six which is way overpowered

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,929
for what we need but we get it for free

40
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:49,139
so that's fine and we also get a few

41
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,299
switches which we put in place and then

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,859
basically roll out the configuration

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,289
from last year which we mean remains

44
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,380
mostly static which is a very good thing

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,109
and all the custom cabling or the build

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,539
up of the access points or the putting

47
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,909
of the video boxes of the cameras all

48
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,880
this stuff happens basically Friday noon

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,300
ish until Friday evening or Friday night

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,010
depending on how well things go and

51
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,260
there's a lot of hands which do things

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,480
in parallel and because this is always

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,069
same venue and we have the same people

54
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,430
who know what they were doing this works

55
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,890
a lot quicker than a lot of other

56
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,540
conferences which sometimes switch

57
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,890
places or whatever yeah

58
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,170
so what is new we have even more people

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,720
which distributes the load quite nicely

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
so we really get to sleep sometimes this

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,400
is really really nice and it gets it's

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,260
getting better every year

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,220
so yeah most of us aren't even sick

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,799
after FOSDEM these days so it's really

65
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,799
getting better we even managed to

66
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,260
install the server and the router the

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,530
main router in December and at most of

68
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,799
the configuration in December simply to

69
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,739
to have more time to do stuff there were

70
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,209
still some things which we could do

71
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,950
basically on the last day because we

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,329
didn't get access to everything we

73
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,030
needed but by and large we had quite

74
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,579
some time to prepare stuff and just to

75
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,670
make sure it's it's actually automated

76
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,829
it's not just all written in a hurry and

77
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,130
in a blank panic this is obviously a

78
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,829
good thing so this year Network

79
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,980
basically worked at 16 o clock on Friday

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:40,200
which is a record three years ago or was

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,970
it for two of us it was basically me and

82
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,160
Murali we we stayed until 20 past 4:00

83
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,690
in the morning and we returned it at

84
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,630
seven ish just to make things work and I

85
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,489
started to work during the opening talk

86
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,859
so when you compare a few years ago to

87
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,079
now it's amazing same for the monitoring

88
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,510
it's started working with all the bells

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,419
and whistles we needed a lot earlier

90
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,160
again we could build in part of what we

91
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,370
put in place last year and we can

92
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,099
actually put all those back in within

93
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,260
seconds for next year so this is also

94
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,918
becoming better

95
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,530
it was also quicker video had some

96
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,780
hiccups also this morning as you

97
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,849
probably noticed we lost a few minutes

98
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,490
of talks in some of the rooms we had to

99
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,350
rearrange a few things

100
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,230
but we expect this to also be better

101
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,840
next year so we're actually getting into

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,970
a state where we can reuse things and

103
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,380
actually see improvement over time as

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,020
it's supposed to be most of this is

105
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,340
invisible to you which is why you're

106
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,720
sitting here and want to know what we

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,750
are doing we are now alert and so

108
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,150
basically we became a member of ripe ncc

109
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,580
which means we get our own permanently

110
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,000
assigned AAS number we get our own / 22

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,160
ipv4 space we get our own / 25 ipv6

112
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,990
space if we need it we still use the

113
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,840
three old / 48 but we've got more than

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,180
enough des droits space in we six now if

115
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,810
we need it

116
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,890
and obviously we still get the temp P is

117
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,310
left 17 for roughly two weeks from apps

118
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,520
for my pen see see where we put all the

119
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,770
people on FOSDEM ancient on for the dual

120
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,960
stack we also have some services still

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,870
in that range but we moved almost all of

122
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,840
it over to to our permanently assigned

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,060
PA space simply because this allows us

124
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,920
to really keep the configuration the

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,390
same for every year keep the same host

126
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,800
names keep everything the same instead

127
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,920
of potentially having to use different

128
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,580
IP space thankfully ripe ncc gave us the

129
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,650
same IP space three times in a row so

130
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,560
that also was really really good because

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
we had a lot less work because we did

132
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,900
not have to real number but we don't

133
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,700
want to rely on this happening year and

134
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,270
year again

135
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,980
and at some point maybe we don't even

136
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,930
need I P before and we can do we six

137
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,470
only as we do on the main SSID as of

138
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,570
right now so how do we do this basically

139
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,700
what we do we if you connect to force

140
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,090
them you only get we six addresses but

141
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,650
you still need to be able to connect to

142
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,190
the v4 world because as we all know you

143
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,620
have to so how do we do is basically we

144
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,610
lie to you

145
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,240
you ask for some servers and you get an

146
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,340
a record back and it's points to some

147
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,290
random ipv4 address we detect us and we

148
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,020
give you a quat a record with an ipv6

149
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,750
address of our ASR and you connect to

150
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,559
that

151
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,809
and then you get basically translated to

152
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,539
v4 on the egress so we've got a few

153
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,369
addresses we actually used up several

154
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,159
ipv4 addresses because there's only

155
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,129
65,000 ports outgoing on each v4 address

156
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,579
so we at peak I think we used like six

157
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,379
or eight v4 addresses for parallel

158
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,229
connections times 65,000 so it's a lot

159
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,079
of connections going out and we

160
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,669
basically do this on the areas are on

161
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,359
one of our servers and that's how we lie

162
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,549
to you if you have any issues a file box

163
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,099
and fix your stuff and be migrated to

164
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,779
foster ancient where you get to all

165
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,579
stack we six and v4 in native this is

166
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,339
also unchanged compared to last year our

167
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,589
backups are still done with oxidized

168
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,269
which still runs quite nicely and you

169
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,649
should use it if you don't you already

170
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,199
use it our conflict management and

171
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,729
deployment is still done with ansible

172
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,279
but there's a lot more in ansible and

173
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,509
it's a lot cleaner last year it was very

174
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,299
fragile really fragile this year we can

175
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,149
even deploy it from several laptops into

176
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,579
the independently and it still works so

177
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,819
this is a very really good improvement

178
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,349
we're using prometheus for for

179
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,369
monitoring as should you

180
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,749
we're using graph on ax for

181
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,569
visualization as should you

182
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,739
I'm not sure if this was actually

183
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:08,919
announced we might have forgotten no did

184
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,949
we retreat you okay so on dashboard at

185
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,049
FOSDEM dot org you'll find a few stats

186
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:18,129
and graphs about what we're doing and IP

187
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,199
management we try to use new pet we

188
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,399
probably won't do it in the future so to

189
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,229
show you even more about what we did

190
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,369
this is also new

191
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:30,069
this is the video dashboard I think yeah

192
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,078
it doesn't matter so what you're seeing

193
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,659
here is basically the stream which goes

194
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,469
out you see the slides and the output

195
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,419
and the input of the slides box so the

196
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,849
slide box is this one and you have one

197
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,800
which looks quite similar attached to

198
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,889
every camera and these basically ingest

199
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,490
the BGA

200
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,540
I'm not sure what this does to the video

201
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,860
recording if this goes back and forth

202
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,030
but doesn't matter sorry

203
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,220
so basically we ingest VGA into the box

204
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,890
and we output VGA to to the projector

205
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,320
and also we dump all the stream on disk

206
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,690
and we swim back home or we can I make

207
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,940
actual online streams out of it and it's

208
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,610
similar for that box and it's pre-made

209
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,140
and you basically just put it in place

210
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,060
and connect a few cables and most of the

211
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,990
times it works

212
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,210
crud we're quite reliable and reliable

213
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,130
you also have a little display which you

214
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,300
can't see this gives you information

215
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,070
about the stream about the IP address

216
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,050
about the MAC address which is really

217
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,300
helpful for debugging all the designs

218
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,720
all the hardware you need there open

219
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,200
look at our github account and there's

220
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
the video repository on in there you'll

221
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,390
find all the things you need to rebuild

222
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,860
those if you want to or you just write

223
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,720
email and we all can tell you about this

224
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,300
but what you also have again is this new

225
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,080
dashboard which shows speaker input

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,260
output of the box and basically chat to

227
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,990
see if anything's breaking and we just

228
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,910
hung this in the walk and people can

229
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,690
look at it so this is our router and

230
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,910
server which looks a lot better than

231
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,220
last year because it's not balanced on

232
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,120
chairs so we actually have a rack which

233
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,580
is new we might even be allowed to keep

234
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,770
this wreck in that place and and maybe

235
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,450
even keep hard where I was so we don't

236
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,670
have to carry it back and forth every

237
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,100
year maybe we're even allowed to keep it

238
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,370
switched on we don't know yet we hope so

239
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,720
and this is something which you might

240
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,390
enjoy this is our server and our video

241
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:45,250
re-encoding farm initially I was

242
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,990
supposed to tell you that you could buy

243
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,730
vouchers at in for us to get those

244
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,230
machines because we basically bought

245
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,090
them off of ebay and are reselling them

246
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,130
but apparently they're all gone I'm not

247
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,900
quite sure but I think that's the case

248
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,570
so if you want any you can head over to

249
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,250
Kay info desk and try your luck but I'm

250
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,230
relatively sure they're all gone

251
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,730
these are x22 with i5 processors

252
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,230
it's actually cheaper to do it this way

253
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,390
than to rent which is kind of weird but

254
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,480
it's the way it is so this is the

255
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,250
outlook from 2016 yes we managed to have

256
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,440
even more preparation we have more in

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,200
ansible we managed to migrate all our

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,550
well we some yeah we managed to migrate

259
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,910
some stuff but no real progress as I

260
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,210
said we became a leer our off-site and

261
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,460
on-site infra is moving towards our own

262
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,190
addresses and our goal to have a

263
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,260
conference in the box is why not there

264
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,840
yet so we really have to have to keep

265
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,550
working on this but we are in a good

266
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,520
track and hopefully at some point you

267
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,870
can clone at least part of our

268
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,580
configuration and just do your own thing

269
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,450
wherever you are

270
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,540
so yeah prepare stuff in advance refine

271
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,220
it over the year you reuse the same

272
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,470
stuff and get some sleep

273
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,880
yeah this is the sealed one sorry that's

274
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,870
dashboard dot FOSDEM dot org and this is

275
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,270
our infrastructure and you can clone it

276
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,860
and you can file issues if you want to

277
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,150
and just steal stuff and suggest stuff

278
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,150
questions

279
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,700
so the question was how many engineers

280
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,560
to work for the FOSDEM infrastructure as

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,010
of four years ago I would have said

282
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,910
three ish now I would say about a dozen

283
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,040
but there's people who do like here work

284
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,650
all year round and to prepare month in

285
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,720
advance and there's people who basically

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,960
pop in and they know one specific thing

287
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,230
be it be briefed on up it permitted

288
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,630
speed Wireless speed whatever and they

289
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,250
pop in they help a little bit and they

290
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,550
pop out so it's it's not very well

291
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,240
defined but by having this mix we can a

292
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,610
draw on more people and more diverse

293
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,380
people who have different backgrounds

294
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,460
and so we get more more specialists for

295
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,760
various stuff I think the next one was

296
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,450
somewhere here No

297
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,940
so the question was if we had so the

298
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,010
question was if we had any any issues

299
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,470
with the wireless ATS during the first

300
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,380
hour of the conference yes we repeatedly

301
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,450
had issues with parts of our

302
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,570
infrastructure especially a wireless the

303
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,170
main reason being this is not our

304
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,270
infrastructure so we get it from you

305
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,310
will be we can make suggestions we can

306
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,040
put up a few more access points but for

307
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,600
Jean so for example you just have too

308
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,220
many people so what you would need to do

309
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,140
is you rip out all the old access points

310
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,210
you put in a ceiling mounted

311
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,130
high-density ones which have a lot of

312
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,500
different antenna and then ship

313
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,960
basically just segment the space below

314
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,700
them so this is not a technical problem

315
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,430
this is a funding and also a planning

316
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,170
problem because you'll be keeps on

317
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,420
repeating that I want to renovate all of

318
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,000
jong-seong which they never do but still

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
every year they have to plan to do it so

320
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,810
they are not really willing to invest

321
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,130
more money and we are so many people we

322
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,870
break the access point infrastructure

323
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,660
but it would technically be possible to

324
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,550
improve this a lot and we would even be

325
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,560
willing to to hand money to you'll be to

326
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,060
fix this but at the moment it's more

327
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,550
administrative than technical no it's

328
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,230
fine

329
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,720
yeah so the comment was it's not a

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,400
complaint just to know but yeah we fully

331
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,930
understand and if it's breaks its it

332
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,520
sucks and we would like to avoid it but

333
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,520
that's the reason and non offense taking

334
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,959
it I didn't think it was a complaint

335
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,180
so I was asked about DNS SEC 4 so the

336
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,680
inherent problem of what we're doing

337
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,650
with dns64 as I said we are lying to you

338
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,330
and if you have DNS SEC we break DNS SEC

339
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,100
because as I said we are lying to you

340
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,340
ask for something there is a a record in

341
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,140
there and we give you quite a so the

342
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,040
NSTIC and dns64 can not work together if

343
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,410
you need DNS SEC or if you have security

344
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,720
requirements which is totally fine if

345
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,480
that's your constraints use for some

346
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
ancient that's why we keep it there to

347
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,460
keep things like that working but there

348
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,910
is no way to make dns64 and DNS SEC work

349
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,460
because their their design goals are

350
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,390
directly orthogonal they cannot be cut

351
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,580
they can't come together it's by design

352
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,240
so I won't repeat everything but

353
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,610
basically I gots a suggestion how to fix

354
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,940
it I think I have one issue with this

355
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,890
which one which won't break things but I

356
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,190
suggest you you join for stemmed -

357
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,640
Network on freenode and repeat what you

358
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,000
said

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
because that's the better venue to

360
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,329
discuss this but I think this might

361
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,859
break because we are doing it on a

362
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:22,469
network level not on the host level but

363
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,020
okay if it's something I need to do in

364
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,000
every host we cannot do this for FOSDEM

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,550
because I can but again let's discuss

366
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,000
this later

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,360
yep

368
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,080
the question was if we have any stats of

369
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
usage of ancient versus current a it's

370
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,570
on the dashboard and B it will it should

371
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,850
be there should be v6 versus v4 usage

372
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,970
and B it will be part of the closing

373
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:08,030
talk which I still have to write sorry

374
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,540
the question was why there is no ipv4 in

375
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,330
the way into my file it's quite simple

376
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,280
so we were pretty much the first

377
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,760
conference so we were in first none is

378
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,620
the first public non networking

379
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,840
conference with only v6 or even we six

380
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,270
enabled on the on the main s society

381
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,910
most of the other ones had I P v6

382
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,620
enabled on on the secondary and

383
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,660
societies at that point we've had a very

384
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,350
first to do to do v6 only with dns64 and

385
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,680
that six four on the main one not even

386
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,420
ripe and dined here after that as far as

387
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm aware why are we doing is this is a

388
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,820
Developers Conference and we want your

389
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,620
things to break and for you to fix them

390
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,840
because you need to do this at some

391
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,730
point and there's a lot of people who

392
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,380
back when we first did it never ever

393
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,750
even once in their lives got exposed to

394
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,330
we to v6 this is different today but

395
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,220
still that was the main motivation to

396
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,410
see if it breaks and burns or if only

397
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,310
something burns it was it went well

398
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,670
enough so the first time we did this the

399
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,590
current you puntal have a desktop

400
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,840
version whatever it was had issues with

401
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,770
v6 only and by chance I knew the the old

402
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,010
main developer of network manager and I

403
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,130
saw him walking by on just summer and I

404
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,960
grabbed him put him in a NOC and gave

405
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,730
him a lap that was like okay this is

406
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,260
broken try and find out why this

407
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,430
business is broken

408
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,260
in the meantime we sent all the users

409
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,480
over to the Ubuntu stand to complain

410
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,810
about this not working because we

411
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,650
couldn't do anything and he found out

412
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,590
what what it was and we sent him over to

413
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,570
to talk to the people to actually get a

414
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,420
fix and I I think it took a day or two

415
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,360
and this is why we do it to force

416
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,940
people to acknowledge that v6s is there

417
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:10,700
and it will come speak up

418
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,860
so the question was about the portable

419
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,890
radios we are carrying yes you may ask

420
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,730
about them we rent them from someone go

421
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,950
to go to front desk and K and ask them I

422
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,809
have no idea they just appear they work

423
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:43,980
and they go away sorry now they're using

424
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,320
radio and we put up a repeater station

425
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,580
so we can reach aw

426
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,100
so the question was why I think the

427
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,660
question was again why we are moving

428
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,070
away from we for and force ish people to

429
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:31,560
to go to v6 correct so know whatever

430
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,020
there are no technical reasons as such

431
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,820
at least not scalability on our site

432
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,010
because we've got a slash 17 from from

433
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,760
ripe ncc which translates to 32,000

434
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,650
dresses if I'm if I remember correctly

435
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,960
so this is way more than enough and if

436
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,360
we needed more we could get more this is

437
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,150
not the issue it's really about forcing

438
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,520
people to to see that things break

439
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,190
especially as this is open source and we

440
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,150
are developers conference

441
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,310
so the question was what what heart were

442
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,930
we are using for Wi-Fi and if we would

443
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,680
recommend it basically yes it depends on

444
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,110
your scale if you've got large scale you

445
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,790
will probably want to go with Cisco or

446
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,880
Aruba they're quite expensive if you

447
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,130
have like 50 people in your office or

448
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,070
maybe even 100 you might want to look at

449
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,840
ubiquity because they're a lot cheaper

450
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,990
and they're good enough but it depends

451
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:55,330
on your use case anyone else

452
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,360
no just louder

453
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,670
so the question was why do we use

454
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,320
multiple laptops instead of a cloud

455
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,280
engine of some sort 8 because we were

456
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,410
able to get those laptops for quite

457
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:22,000
cheap so basically if we had if we had

458
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,920
had a few servers which are beefy enough

459
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,990
we could have done this ourselves but it

460
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,620
was just cheaper to do it this way and

461
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,480
also we don't want to rely on an outside

462
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,640
connection because as I said as of right

463
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,130
now we have one uplink if that breaks

464
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,350
and we lose anything local due to that

465
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,750
that's really bad

466
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,760
and also laptops have built-in UPS which

467
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:52,360
is quite nice the question was if we

468
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,400
have ups on everything else no we don't

469
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:03,300
and because for example it switches

470
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,120
there's no GPS in that place we do have

471
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,660
UPS in our main room which we are now

472
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,180
using because before someone cabled up

473
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,430
all the video laptops and then plug them

474
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,190
in that was the time when both the

475
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,330
server and throughout the went off

476
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,290
because the circuit breaker broke so

477
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:30,180
yeah but this is now on UPS anyone else

478
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,610
so the question was what CMDB are we

479
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,470
currently using and why are you looking

480
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,450
for alternatives we are currently using

481
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,040
Moin Moin wiki and we are looking for a

482
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
ton of speakers we're currently using

483
00:24:50,360 --> 00:25:01,520
1:1 wiki the question was how fast the

484
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,320
uplink is it's 10 gigs and it's way too

485
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,930
much for us because as we only have

486
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,570
Wi-Fi no one really can use it except

487
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:17,810
for for ourselves with the video the

488
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,280
question was if there is 10 gig network

489
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,490
cabling within the building our stuff no

490
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,010
because we don't have the switches which

491
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,470
are quick enough but this is only

492
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,030
whatever we get from the Cisco demo pool

493
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,270
basically so everything which is single

494
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,250
mode we could easily do 10 gig or 20 or

495
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,000
50 or doesn't care

496
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,210
the question was if there is any

497
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,550
upstream video equipment so you only

498
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,230
think we have upstream as we have a few

499
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,940
cloud servers to do the streaming setup

500
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,740
for us because we duplicate the streams

501
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,840
outside of of the building

502
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,970
I think we're done thank you

503
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:16,410
[Applause]
