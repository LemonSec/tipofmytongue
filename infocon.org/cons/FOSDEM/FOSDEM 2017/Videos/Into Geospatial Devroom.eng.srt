it is full please sit closer to each

34
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,850
other sometimes you see people standing

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,130
at the side it's not needed if there's a

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,770
sign on the door which is full that you

37
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,479
should not enter a room it's also for

38
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,969
security reasons if there are too many

39
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,999
people the security can close the event

40
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,369
which means of all the fulton so we

41
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,010
don't want that to happen then i have

42
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,989
some things for the present presenters

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,710

44
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,600
minutes break and I or somebody else

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,340
from the level managers but the I don't

46
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,790

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,530

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,640
and I will show science if I show five

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,090
minutes left it means that you still

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,190
have five minutes after that for

51
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,700
questions and and and everything and

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,470
then after that we have five minutes

53
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,540
break to switch presenters if you are

54
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,740
really in the discussion you can

55
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,050
continue but then expect your next

56
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,550
presenter to already put his laptop and

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,590
things like that so that you can come in

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,870
not worry if you're a presenter and

59
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,980
there are questions from the audience

60
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,390
please repeat them because we are using

61
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,270
video so I wear a microphone it's not

62
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,710
for you hearing me

63
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,680
it's because we are recording for the

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,220
sound quality so please repeat questions

65
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,330
and then final thing I would like to say

66
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,550
I want to promote a bit some activities

67
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,120

73
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,870
happening in March is VGO which is a

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,900

75
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,880
geospatial things and there are about

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,209
2,000 participants and oag oh so the

77
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,390
open source geospatial foundation of

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,010
Belgium we will have a track there and

79
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,350
if you would like to present you have to

80
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,510

tomorrow who will be in that track it's

82
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,160
a very nice thing because you can reach

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,670
both non well open-source developers and

84
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,340
non open-source people in the same place

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,860
then there are two more activities which

86
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,640
I want to promote

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,548
it's a phosphor G International which is

88
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,350
an international conference in Boston

89
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,700
this summer I think in August

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,350
phosphor G it's called it's a free and

91
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,130
open source for geospatial

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,100
that's a comfortable as you we have

93
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,710
another one at sort of July in Manoa

94
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,540
Valley in Paris actually which will be a

95
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,580
more European gathering and I forgot to

96
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,380
add the OpenStreetMap conference I don't

97
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,820
know if anyone knows where that will be

98
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,110

101
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,920
university of brussels but that's

102
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,890
another university in this one anyway so

103
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,150
