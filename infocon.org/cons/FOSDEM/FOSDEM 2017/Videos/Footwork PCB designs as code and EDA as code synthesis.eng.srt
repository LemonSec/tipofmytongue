1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,709
Kaspar I'm an electronic

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,299
engineer and software developer and I

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:12,260
use kicad if you want to grab these

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,089
slides there's a lot of hyperlinks in

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,160
here as well and you can anything I

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,750
reference you can look up the slides and

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,300
you be able to get to the thing I'm

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,529
talking about so I'm going to talk about

9
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,849
experiment of sorts it's probably not

10
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,439
hugely useful yet but it's quite

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,790
interesting I think and it's about

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,800
defining PCBs as code and using code

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,560
synthesis as an EDA tool so it's got it

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,350
kind of all started with KY CAD and the

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,700
file formatting click add the text

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,190
formats and like a lot of people they

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,200
use cockeyed I think I I dove in and

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,060
started editing things when the do I

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,970
wouldn't let me do what I wanted to do

20
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,670
and while I was doing that you know I'd

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,380
have my text editor on one side and KY

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,480
code on the other and and I thought

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,980
wouldn't it be nice if KY cut

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,710
immediately a refreshed the view when I

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,239
edited it and I could see what I was

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,920
doing in a more kind of interactive

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,630
fashion and kind of in parallel this is

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,340
I was interested in high school when I

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,289
was learning high school and I wrote

30
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,859
parser and a writer for for the piece

31
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,899
for the Chi card foot print format in

32
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,619
high school just because I heard the s

33
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,509
expressions are easy to pass and that

34
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,490
could be a good learning exercise so I

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,639
wrote this and then I went kind of way

36
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,709
overboard with the testing and I checked

37
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,329
it against every footprint I could find

38
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,549
and I used something called quick check

39
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,350
which is probably one of my favorite

40
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,630
things about Haskell it's a it's a

41
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,590
property testing tool where you it will

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,529
generate random test cases for you based

43
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,139
on and then check them against your

44
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,670
assertions so if you say something is

45
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,279
true about your program it will generate

46
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,039
random data and you know as long as you

47
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,159
tell it to do it like by default we'll

48
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,569
try a hundred times where you can tell

49
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,319
it to do thousands of randomly generated

50
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,999
for a randomly generated data at your

51
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,090
program to try and disprove your

52
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,069
property your assertion which in in the

53
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,900
case of the parser and the writer

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,329
because they're symmetrical is if I say

55
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,350
my if my chi

56
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,210
if I write out my cat expression and

57
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,980
pass that again I should have the same

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,160
expression so I do that with this tool

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,220
as well but kind of back to s

60
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,220
expressions because you know as I wrote

61
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,050
this path I learned more about them and

62
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,170
how they actually you know quite they're

63
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,760
not only easy to pass but actually a

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,890
representation of the past tree it's

65
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,320
quite a simple representation and I

66
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,270
learn more about Lisp and the schemes

67
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,610
and kind of other languages that make

68
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,780
use of this so I kind of I stumbled

69
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,190
across racket which is which is touted

70
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,020
as a programmable programming language

71
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,690
so what I found when I when I read up on

72
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,760
Lisp is it there's a lot of this quite

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
strong focus on macros and modifying the

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,710
language and your needs and defining new

75
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,260
languages within the language because of

76
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,480
the kind of ease that s-expressions

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,870
allowed within that escalations allowed

78
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,540
this you know for you to do this fairly

79
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,680
easily but so in racket you kind of it

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,110
has quite nice GYN bindings as well so

81
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,360
you know in the back of my mind I was

82
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,770
thinking about my editor and what kind

83
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,630
of editor I wanted to create so I was

84
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,270
quite pleased that there's nice gtk

85
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,420
bindings for racket and it has this IDE

86
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,000
which is where you can interactively

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
play with record code so when you self

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,710
with record the first thing to say is

89
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,030
I'm going to use the like record

90
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,640
language because that's not a pre given

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,830
thing if you're using racket so you can

92
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,180
there's also something called a

93
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,700
slideshow language I didn't use this for

94
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,960
my presentation but you can

95
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,740
interactively in the in the repple you

96
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,380
can you can it has graphical output and

97
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,270
other needs there's there's there's

98
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,050
quite a lot of different languages

99
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,370
there's even an implementation of Python

100
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,710
so racket kind of took this idea of

101
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,620
using macros and and modifying the

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,298
language to the extreme that you don't

103
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,980
even need as expressions in your

104
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,329
language anymore you can define other

105
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,250
languages that don't use ice exhibitions

106
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,790
so there's a there's an implementation

107
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,660
of Python in racket so I thought

108
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,180
wouldn't it be neat if not only

109
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,620
we have an editor where we can modify

110
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,100
the the file format but we can also kind

111
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,680
of mix in a programming language into

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
into the into the format so having a

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,980
language you're like a chi CAD language

114
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,580
in racket and this is kind of how far I

115
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,140
got with it I'd hope to make more

116
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,250
progress on this before I gave this

117
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,140
presentation but you know life kind of

118
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,760
co-op with me and I'm giving another

119
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,770
presentation next which is where I spend

120
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,690
most of my time about open source

121
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,060
hardware sharing platform but just about

122
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,830
this so this is how far I got with it so

123
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,470
you can mix in this this general-purpose

124
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,020
programming language into the clay card

125
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,330
format so if you look at FP line that's

126
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,760
that's that's what the footprint format

127
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,050
and Chi guide looks like and you can

128
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,400
here's a for loop that kind of it

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,390
outputs these FP line statements so you

130
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,160
can kind of recurse arbitrarily deep

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
into this and the end it will flatten it

132
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,600
out and give you your Chi CAD file back

133
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,360
so this is kind of what this is kind of

134
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,850
what the code looks that's kind of how

135
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,980
that works at the moment there's a

136
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,320
there's a syntax rule for the module

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,450
which is the high-level kind of this is

138
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,120
my add module my footprint which is

139
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,870
defined as a drawing of items and then

140
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,020
we define the drawing what what it means

141
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,440
to draw an item is to kind of execute

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,870
all the functions that that item is

143
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,750
defined as and flattening it completely

144
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,240
so that you only have this this kind of

145
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,660
flat Chi CAD file and there's a little

146
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,050
bit of just checking what layer this

147
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,570
this footprint is on and kind of

148
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,390
translating that to something within

149
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,760
within within the cat within the record

150
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,890
code here so this is to clarify this is

151
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,780
kind of what the source of what my

152
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,220
editor looks like at the moment so this

153
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,230
is kind of defining the kite study

154
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,610
starts of defining a chi cat language

155
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,200
so at the bottom I define an F P text

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,400
item with again it's that's the ad

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,740
footprint expression really

158
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,139
and I define it as a function that takes

159
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,139
in the DC which is a joint context and

160
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,300
then executes functions on that drawing

161
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,570
context so this is really I defined FP

162
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,580
text as a as a drawing function so I

163
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,410
mean kind of before you get too excited

164
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,449
about all of this is really early days

165
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,789
for this I already mentioned I hope to

166
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,650
make more progress on it and this is

167
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,090
kind of this screenshot really shows

168
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,410
what I've done in the best light

169
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,259
possible ways and this isn't I'm not

170
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,260
using the right units the the line style

171
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,539
isn't quite right yet you can't really

172
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:26,000
do anything useful with us yet but just

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,270
to jump ahead a bit I had some more

174
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,910
ideas or surrounding this and it would

175
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,760
be nice actually to if I managed to

176
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,330
develop this further to use the

177
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,310
graphical part used to do graphical

178
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,410
manipulation or you know traditional

179
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,979
Mouse base manipulation or direct

180
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,530
manipulation as well as the programming

181
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,150
side so kind of to be able to intermix

182
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,789
these two and I started thinking around

183
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,990
this problem and I came across the

184
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,970
project which is quite a similar thing

185
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,849
for SVG's and you kind of you have this

186
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,210
they have a special DSL for SVG's

187
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,340
and then they have their graphical PI

188
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,460
here and they've got done quite a lot of

189
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,139
this is called sketching sketch believe

190
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,930
it's by someone called Ravi Chung and

191
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,820
there it's in development as well and

192
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,590
they've done quite a lot made a lot of

193
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,030
progress and do some interesting things

194
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,360
way where you where the where the kind

195
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,770
of the graphical many because about

196
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,990
manipulation side it generates the code

197
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,740
for you that that that isn't just you

198
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,890
know isn't just is readable so is

199
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,630
readable so unusable and modifiable on

200
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,440
the code side again but what I didn't

201
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,790
find in sketching cat sketch it is some

202
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,520
way for you to generate loops like this

203
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,740
and when I say loops really this is a

204
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,050
kind of reversed map statement if you're

205
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,820
into functional program it returns

206
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,339
what's what it what what it the state

207
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,059
the

208
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,649
thing it defines it doesn't just you

209
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:07,999
know execute site and side-effects so I

210
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,949
was I was thinking about this problem on

211
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,649
how how can how can I get how would I

212
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:15,079
get my editor to generate this kind of

213
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,479
code for me and Ike and I came about and

214
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:21,219
I I heard of the rosette language and

215
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,569
I'd heard of like formal verification

216
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,859
before and I always thought you were

217
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:26,869
less something that you know you do when

218
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,819
you you're working on safety critical

219
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,959
systems but I'd never heard the term

220
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,689
program assists is kind of with this as

221
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:40,429
well which is what rosette advertisers

222
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,129
and rosette is also a language in racket

223
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,759
now what racket what rosette does is it

224
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,869
connects racket up to SMT solvers that's

225
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:54,859
satisfiability more giulio theory it

226
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,349
solvers which doesn't tell you much more

227
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:58,809
if you don't know anything about it but

228
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,489
what what it essentially means is kind

229
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:04,969
of similar to what I was doing with with

230
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,609
with the Haskell testing but instead of

231
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:11,419
just you know picking up random you know

232
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,669
generating random data it actually tries

233
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:18,349
to exhaustively go test every possible

234
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,029
every possibility it's like an

235
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,729
exhaustive testing tool now this doesn't

236
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,709
sound it really doesn't sound possible

237
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,469
and then you know you know if you ask me

238
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,299
how do they how does this work it's

239
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,249
really very complicated because it's

240
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,289
essentially an np-hard problem and

241
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,999
there's a lot of interesting algorithms

242
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,799
that go into that and that's kind of out

243
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,779
of the scope of this talk by which I

244
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,579
mean I don't know really but there's a

245
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:44,989
lot of SMT service in this it's an

246
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:47,929
active area research and the one that

247
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,029
that rosette uses is said 3 which is

248
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,519
actually written by Microsoft like

249
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,259
Microsoft Research and December IT

250
00:10:54,259 --> 00:11:00,069
licensed and so again rosette kind of

251
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,139
hooks up the confuse programmer which is

252
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:04,789
you right there with the question mark

253
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:11,329
and and gives you lets you use rosette

254
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,990
to generate

255
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,550
- gently to do programming synthesis and

256
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,800
as this is this is a this is kind of the

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,450
talk that got me into all of this and

258
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,400
it's a very good talk and I recommend it

259
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,870
for anyone interested in the subject and

260
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,810
the links are in the slide but there's a

261
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,210
bit of question if you maybe you've

262
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,950
understood now that it's an exhaustive

263
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,220
checking to the SMT solvers exhaustive

264
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,450
check into it but how can this be used

265
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,080
for simple synthesis and really the way

266
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,630
so far if I understand it correctly if

267
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,310
anyone knows more this feel free to

268
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,830
interrupt me if I'm you know speaking

269
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,380
nonsense but you pretty much give it a

270
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,120
template of your desired construct so

271
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,160
you could give it an empty for loop and

272
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
you leave kind of the holes and there

273
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,200
the question marks and then you then you

274
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,120
have left the oh you know it's next

275
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
slide and then you can give it an

276
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,540
assertion about your code so you would

277
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,980
say I want to synthesize something

278
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,960
that's the equivalent of if we go back

279
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,730
so this is trying to generate a pad at

280
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,800
at a particular location kind of

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,210
simplified chi-chi expression there and

282
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,470
you could say I want this to be the

283
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,410
equivalent of a pad at 0 1 and a padded

284
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,680
0 2 and then you could with rosette and

285
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,650
this assertion get a rosette and through

286
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,360
back through the SMC server to give you

287
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,490
the solution to that what kind of what

288
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,350
kind of for loop construct is required

289
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:53,870
to get this output here I mean you might

290
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,920
think that well that's a lot of

291
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,810
complicated stuff that you'd have to

292
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,230
learn to maybe make something that's not

293
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,060
necessarily useful I mean I find it

294
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,500
interesting I'm not I'm not sure

295
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,880
footprints are necessary the the best

296
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,920
application verse one of the most

297
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,480
exciting things about all of this

298
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,190
research is this is a feature in

299
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,800
Microsoft Excel which is called flash

300
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,140
fill and they use program as this and

301
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,620
it's from the same I believe the person

302
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,410
that came up with this has was was

303
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,390
studying with the same people that have

304
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,450
blinking in and this kind of from

305
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,430
examples if we go back to if it goes

306
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,320
when in loop specter so there you give

307
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,000
an a an example and you say flash fill

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,370
that and it tries to figure out what

309
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,500
kind of transformation you want it on on

310
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,840
that data so it writes a little tiny

311
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
program for you to do that

312
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,110
transformation and it might get it it

313
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,550
might say I don't know enough about what

314
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,770
you've told me there to synthesize all

315
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,330
that and if you give it another example

316
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,550
it will be able to figure out what you

317
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,100
wanted what kind of program you want it

318
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,780
to generate so that's my talk for now

319
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,650
it's a little bit short but so there's

320
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:10,240
quite a lot of time for comments yes

321
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,470
[Music]

322
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:53,880
[Music]

323
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,740
[Music]

324
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,129
[Music]

325
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,949
yeah I think I think then there might be

326
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,300
that might be there might be more into

327
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,170
it like I said they might be more

328
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,519
interesting areas than for editing

329
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,610
footprints I quite like using the

330
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,899
footprint format because it's quite

331
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,060
limited and I can I can it's kind of I

332
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,399
can get somewhere quickly but yeah I'm

333
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,750
sure there's more interesting

334
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:52,970
applications any other well the way I

335
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,620
envision it to work is that you write

336
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,589
your you write you can write arbitrary

337
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,410
code in here and actually if I ran this

338
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,350
you could you could go up here and say

339
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,720
on the module and say I kind of execute

340
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,310
all of that and then you get your normal

341
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,870
card PCB expression and then you can

342
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,120
save that and you can you I'm not quite

343
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,089
sure how how those two formats will will

344
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:29,779
work out and sorry what's that say neck

345
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,250
port are med parts yes I have I have

346
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,910
I've seen that yeah yeah yeah

347
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,920
yeah I mean cake had the the cock-eyed

348
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,629
weeds this is the cockeyed footprint

349
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,300
format I mean except for the for loop

350
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:14,098
[Music]

351
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:22,460
and even before that you have your PCBs

352
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,039
not maybe not going flat

353
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,419
flex and multi like month one use your

354
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,659
walls

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,549
[Applause]

356
00:18:55,239 --> 00:19:01,749
yeah I've got one yeah a little bit shot

357
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:20,179
allows people to move in and out I mean

358
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,730
really enjoyed your talk really good

359
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,950
I especially like the high level view it

360
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,330
was good it was gonna be good for me

361
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,600
okay Manny said I keep going up I like

362
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,119
getting the sauce compiling it looking

363
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,149
at it so it was good to get that high

364
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:47,539
level view powder with that so the the

365
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,710
the example - will that work for the

366
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,809
both canvases I'm fine

367
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,139
[Music]

368
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:11,119
but that's no in five is survival still

369
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,539
have legacy

370
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,850
yeah I know that vote but and was it

371
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,130
even on six get rid of legacy cameras

372
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,419
yeah probably six just a few things

373
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,170
[Music]

374
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,160
we're trying to think what I miss

375
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,730
sometimes I switch back I declare my boy

376
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,790
sometimes I think quick to me I'm a

377
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,850
shortcut I think my shortcut some of

378
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,450
chances and or something oh yeah

379
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,270
removing segments when you have it

380
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,580
enabled and then you cover over a trifle

381
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,530
easily which removes the whole

382
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,930
connection but it's a bit different than

383
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,270
the gasoline so there is such option

384
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,450
today

385
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,520
hey my turn again

386
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,040
yeah this is why I didn't wouldn't it be

387
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,310
useful if you had for instance databases

388
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:40,430
with if you have database that you can

389
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,450
extrapolate with the language those

390
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,840
footprints and not like at automatically

391
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,090
generate from a from a database given

392
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,330
from from a manufacturer yeah I'm not

393
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,470
sure this would help that much if you've

394
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,150
got the if you've got the drawing if you

395
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,530
if you've got the database and you've

396
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,390
got the footprint you wouldn't really

397
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,580
need this the only thing is if it if you

398
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,370
want to do two parametric thing the

399
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,110
other area is interesting if you if you

400
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,170
look at like 3d CAD is the did they do

401
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,390
constraint based CAD do you say I want

402
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,190
this to be here I want to spew here and

403
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,220
then I think the

404
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,350
is the code synthesis in the constraint

405
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,019
solving could be quite useful in like in

406
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,269
freecad for instance if you have a

407
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:30,379
flange and you put in ten holes you you

408
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,809
meant the diameter from from the flange

409
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:38,299
it's either will disperse the holes you

410
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,179
have ten volts over the wider diameter

411
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,919
yeah or it could be that if you fix the

412
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,940
diameter to the puts in two more holes

413
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:57,289
yeah so that's parametric I'm gonna

414
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:04,190
prepare my other presentation I'm so

415
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,149
glad the Internet's good with all the

416
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,149
noise

417
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:45,370
oh yeah oh yeah I think I'm I can't the

418
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,650
keyboards not working the keyboard

419
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,429
doesn't seem to be working

420
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,730
seems to be working

421
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm just you know just that okay maybe

422
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,710
in full screen mode

423
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,890
[Music]

424
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,529
what no clothes on the opener I've never

425
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,760
actually played with the screen

426
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:45,970
I go for 20 minutes of speech and then

427
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,320
five minutes for questions

428
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,590
yep
