1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
to the excel bedroom

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,759
Brandon the first talk about display

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,000
managers his sick with the flu

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,189
I asked Alice to sit healthy have sub

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,430
dog and he said to delight us with de

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:27,470
cádiz limbic you're ours yes we didn't

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:42,320
have closed soft so yes Powell told us

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,989
that there was some space to talk about

9
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,909
things we don't really have anything

10
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,089
prepared so said let's do a Q&A over the

11
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,100
KD Aslam Aslam book which means we're

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,010
here but we also need the Q part which

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,189
would come from you to make it a little

14
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:00,379
bit less awkward we can introduce the

15
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,170
project a little bit no I don't know

16
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,680
it's a bit less over so I'm gonna show

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,929
you the device you can open conky sleeve

18
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:17,539
not included it's great laptop featuring

19
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:22,670
a KD logo on top merged in the slim book

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,840
logo it's a brilliant clone of a MacBook

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,079
Air

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,790
it has a keyboard with all of the

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,810
letters and even some numbers a sticker

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,350
with with a penguin not really know what

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,460
it's coming from also also it has

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,190
penguin on a on a key say well yeah the

27
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,220
penguin is actually a sticker on the

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:01,009
previously penguin less key but we are

29
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,840
working on end so that's what the first

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,660
kill you get five points there

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,050
there's no raffle though so I would love

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,970
to have a raffle but that's not the case

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,340
also it has a touch pad it has a full HD

34
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,280
screen intel processors for all of us

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,630
who like processors and well that's the

36
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,190
idea as soon as the part is solid but

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,300
what's the building up okay I said the

38
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,220
most relevant parties this is running

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,739
plasma by default this device comes pre

40
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,049
shipped with KD neon so it always has

41
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,510
the latest plasma on it and you can just

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,150
start it up set up your user and you're

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,269
good to go so for us it was interesting

44
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,390
as asked ad like Herod and I have been

45
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,239
working on on KD together for really

46
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,250
really long long time and whenever

47
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,769
people came to us and said you're doing

48
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,840
really get great things how do we use

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,810
what you do it was like yeah you go to

50
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,090
store where they have laptops these

51
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,360
laptops will come with Windows on it

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,160
describes that and then you've format

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,140
your hard disk you partition it because

54
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,579
it's really important that your

55
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,280
partition it and then you insult Linux

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,310
on it and then you install plasma on it

57
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,680
because well that's what actually what

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,709
we do and then you will have a device

59
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,620
running the the wonderful free server we

60
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,140
make but well then a lot of people get

61
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,220
lost in Ind on the track and well now we

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,380
will be able to tell people if you

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,140
want to test what we do in candy just

64
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,450
buy this device or go to the store and

65
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,700
well do the whole process is if that's

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,610
what you liked and that's perfectly fine

67
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,970
as well

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,430
well now you have the opportunity I said

69
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,650
you can make the questions and we will

70
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,640
try to answer them yes

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,370
[Music]

72
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,550
book people have been selling laptops

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,370
with Linux for a while now and they

74
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,430
already had a wide range of of distros

75
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,240
available of course it won't be gnomes

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,210
Limburg I mean it will be enormous limbo

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,120
where you have installed Fedora or one

78
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,430
two or whatever you want on it and then

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,070
you can just get this device and well

80
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,410
form a change for or just to install

81
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,520
namsan desktop or something like that I

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,670
guess it will be in Ubuntu it's it neon

83
00:04:43,670 --> 00:05:01,250
is based on Ubuntu afterafter also cheap

84
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,549
copy

85
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:07,809
netbook we didn't work on the on the

86
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:14,019
design of the device I think that the

87
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:18,209
highway business is really complex and

88
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,269
Kady has tried to get into it in the

89
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:25,989
past and got really burnt so for us the

90
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:27,909
important part is to be able to have

91
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,429
devices to get into people hands and

92
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,249
that's the important part

93
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,529
surfing this this two points to this

94
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,499
first of all fascist KDE the device

95
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:41,439
itself the important bit is that it that

96
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,159
it works and that we have it right this

97
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,109
is basically getting our foot into the

98
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:50,559
door of getting into hardware ideally we

99
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,619
would have more devices right we have

100
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,709
done mobile projects in the past for for

101
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:59,199
mobile phones we've all sit on tablet

102
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,939
projects and one of the big problems is

103
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,399
we as the KT community we do not have

104
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,109
the experience in dealing with Hardware

105
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,559
right by partnering up with companies we

106
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,719
get them to contribute to the hardware

107
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,189
experience we contribute the software

108
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,539
experience and so can we can build

109
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,249
something something better together

110
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,399
right and the second point of view is I

111
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,509
think yeah there's clearly a point there

112
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,189
if it looks a lot like a MacBook then

113
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,749
yeah it does look like a cheap knockoff

114
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,659
on the other hand I would argue that the

115
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,399
MacBook is probably one of the better

116
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,169
devices and the better-looking devices

117
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,449
so if you're doing a knockoff at least

118
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,579
do it off something really good so

119
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,959
that's a way to look at it

120
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,300
the question is if there's gonna be a

121
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,820
model wave discrete video card the

122
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,260
answer is no I don't think we're even

123
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,020
looking into that so one of the things

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,810
about the project is that if another

125
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,630
manufacturer wanted to do laptop with

126
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,990
kiddie we could look into that right and

127
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,720
if that manufacturer decided that they

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,980
have discrete graphics card we could

129
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,620
even consider it but we haven't

130
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,030
considered it both because we don't have

131
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,360
another manufacturer and because what we

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,910
just are happy that to have this one out

133
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,820
at the moment also personally I don't

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,860
really think it's it's something very

135
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,000
important maybe it is any other

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,510
questions

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:54,040
well it's perfect on the last ten years

138
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,960
I've been using Intel drivers and I've

139
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,870
been super happy I mean it could be

140
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,710
better but for normal desktop usage

141
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,240
compiling doesn't go all that faster

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,190
when you're using a discrete graphics

143
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,780
card so that's I would say that it's

144
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,190
fast enough to run plasma that was

145
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,910
surprisingly fast all right little by

146
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:33,549
little sure or I can leave it here if

147
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:39,190
somebody wants to come just don't bite

148
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:46,780
on it it would be weird slim book the

149
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,230
your the URL is slim book that yes they

150
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,510
are based in Valencia Spain

151
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,490
okay

152
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,470
do you have any anecdotes we can talk

153
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:18,029
about not really there are two main

154
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,569
versions one with until I 5 which starts

155
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:29,309
at 700 euros with 128 gigabytes of disk

156
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:34,410
then 4 gigabytes from then it scales up

157
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,879
to 1000 and hundred something with high

158
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,199
seven and half a terabyte of disk and 60

159
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:48,300
gigabytes of RAM there's the possibility

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,389
to get it with a couple of different but

161
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,600
components I was thinking about keyboard

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,209
layouts I sorry different German friends

163
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,459
and so on which basically will be the

164
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,949
same disposition but with like the keys

165
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:14,339
differently arranged and components well

166
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,730
you can choose which Wi-Fi card you want

167
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,850
it's not that it matters well yeah both

168
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,899
for Wi-Fi and

169
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,110
well no that's not original one because

170
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,330
that one doesn't have KD in it well this

171
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,890
is not a kid an apple thing right

172
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,680
yeah the weird thing is for the ethernet

173
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,620
because they couldn't fit it so I have

174
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,250
the adapter there if you're curious yeah

175
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,620
there's a dongle no no it's not USB it's

176
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,459
their own weird thing actually I think

177
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:17,629
that you can purchase hub kind of kind

178
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,420
of thing that you can use for also

179
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,990
screen things and so on I don't have it

180
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,240
so I can't really tell you

181
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:31,150
oh sorry as I said from 700 yeah let

182
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,320
let's open the website down it's between

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,270
700 and 1,000 and something euros

184
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,740
that's the website where we explain why

185
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,990
we did it mostly I will show you the

186
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,329
gallery but you have the device or iPod

187
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:09,149
on so that you know I said high five

188
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,480
oh yeah right I forgot

189
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,850
and um as I said we have a bunch of

190
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,529
things you can configure it's a normal

191
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,940
page and of course what in practice how

192
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,100
it works is that you actually make the

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,529
purchase to slim book not to Katie

194
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,800
whatsoever there is a small donation

195
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,350
that will happen between slim book and

196
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,630
Han KD then we provided them with an I

197
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,570
so that that will be installed on those

198
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,839
devices

199
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,769
well it's not as guys who give the

200
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,370
guarantee it's Limburg but then it's a

201
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,000
normal European Union guarantee of two

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,480
years where you basically send them the

203
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,180
device they fix it and get it back to

204
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:31,790
you so in theory I mean I haven't tested

205
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,160
it but in theory if you use any Linux

206
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,500
it's just going to work because all the

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
drivers are open so there are no binary

208
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,240
flops the the Wi-Fi driver is into a

209
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,110
graphics is into touchpad definitely

210
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,510
runs through PS Mouse module so nothing

211
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,300
nothing proprietary about it

212
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:08,610
understandably understandably slim book

213
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,370
dust has plans for other devices we

214
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,560
haven't talked about any further

215
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,480
partners like extending the partnership

216
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,000
to other devices now that we have the

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,320
conversation going

218
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,970
it's something that could happen it's

219
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,850
not something we're pursuit just yet but

220
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,350
well our focus at the moment is to get

221
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,240
this one right it's not like to say and

222
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,100
now we're gonna do laptops forever

223
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,550
because actually it's coming more from

224
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,230
the frustration that we're doing the

225
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,940
laptop more than we think that we should

226
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,700
be doing laptop right I mean if the

227
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,730
market had been as good as we'd like

228
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,230
maybe we wouldn't have for it ten months

229
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,120
maybe we would and it's the right thing

230
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,720
to do right but um in any case we're not

231
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,910
going to get rich with it either so

232
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:22,970
my treasure I don't know you want me to

233
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,380
repeat the question you are doing so but

234
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,000
the question was if we if the devices

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,960
ship to America right and other

236
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,120
countries where they have buttons and

237
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,400
software patents I am not really aware

238
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,130
of any device having been shipped there

239
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,270
and well it's Slingbox decision to send

240
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,820
it there I think that their policy is

241
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,800
just you buy it and we're gonna ship it

242
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,810
to you and if it stopped at the customs

243
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,120
or anything it's more your problem than

244
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,140
theirs but yeah I don't really have all

245
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,619
of the information

246
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,398
so do you think it would be a big

247
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:59,100
problem to sell these devices in us but

248
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,269
we'll be aware of it anyhow

249
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:07,049
any other question maybe we can leave it

250
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,690
here we'll have a long break and then I

251
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,440
will start again I think more of you yes

252
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm sorry

253
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,720
you
