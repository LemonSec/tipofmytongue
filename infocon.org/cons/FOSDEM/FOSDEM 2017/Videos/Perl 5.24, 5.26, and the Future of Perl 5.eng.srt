1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,110
hi everyone

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,219
okay good we're starting good so I'm

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,740
gonna talk about pearl five I say the

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,600
word pearl often so whenever I say pearl

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,230
imagine I said profi okay I'm gonna talk

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,670
about five twenty four I'm gonna talk

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,130
about five twenty six 524 is already out

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,230
it's running a lot of people don't

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,369
really know what's in it so I'm gonna

10
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,140
talk about that and I'm gonna talk about

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,970
what we're going to have in five twenty

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,070
six which comes out very very soon as in

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,610
two months and and then I'm gonna talk

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,500
about what might happen in future

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,090
versions and I'm gonna mention a lot of

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,250
things that are history policy ideas and

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,960
hopefully give you kind of the tone that

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,660
we're trying to get in Pearl nowadays

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,250
and I think is very very crucially

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,300
important to hear the way we see it so

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
let's start with basics I was told they

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,519
always need to start with like who are

23
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:58,960
you because like a lot of you are not

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,820
don't know and that's I mean that's a

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,080
good thing but now you do so you can

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,960
call me Sawyer that's a easiest way and

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,510
I do a lot of pearl I enjoy very much I

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,280
write in various languages pearls my

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,930
favorite I have a lot of fun with it

30
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,360
luckily enough I work at a company it

31
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
actually pays me to do it and that's

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,330
even better and I'm currently the

33
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,370
profile punking which is the role of the

34
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,140
kind of like the project lead on the

35
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,660
language which is very odd

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,410
it's very heavy it's very scary but with

37
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,700
people like you it's a lot of fun too so

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,030
it's great I also am the project lead of

39
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,650
a small web framework in perl called

40
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,830
dancer too and I work at booking.com and

41
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,030
obviously we're hiring is anyone else

42
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,790
here hiring by any chance any hands I

43
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,430
got one and good yeah I think I saw like

44
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,080
seven people with we're hiring shirts

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,960
where was this nine in the room so there

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,840
are a few I mean one or two all right so

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,630
what I start what I'm gonna start with

48
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,190
is development once a month we work on a

49
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,930
release that collects all of the

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,128
development that we've done during that

51
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,260
month and then we bundle all that

52
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,819
together and we throw it out as a

53
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,099
development release we do this every

54
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,450
month and the reason is that we do this

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,740
in order to collect information

56
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,110
about those changes and to see how

57
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,120
stable they were what kind of changes

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
and impacts they've made and what kind

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,350
of alterations we want to this so it's

60
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,570
kind of like I guess nowadays we call

61
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,050
this agile so well it used to be like

62
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,600
your work on a workflow for waterfall

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,490
workflow for like I don't know six

64
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,900
months and then you have the product or

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,070
you work on for two years then you have

66
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,800
the product we just have it every month

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,810
the last one was released two weeks ago

68
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,080
by Abigail and it was five twenty five

69
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,110
nine which means that the next one will

70
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,170
be five twenty nine five twenty five ten

71
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,230
and that will eventually lead to a

72
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,920
stable release so every single month you

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,790
get a new set of changes that you can

74
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,200
install and you can run

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
you probably shouldn't but you can and

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,660
when we talk about development obviously

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,340
there's a difference there's development

78
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,810
they're stable we also do stable

79
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,100
releases which means every so often we

80
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,420
collect all of those development changes

81
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,130
we bundle all together and then we send

82
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,660
it off and that's a new stable release

83
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,840
so how do we get there well we start

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,790
with a lot of smoking now I come from

85
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,130
Amsterdam so this might mean more than

86
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,790
one thing but when we talk about smoking

87
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,440
in Prague we actually mean testing

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,810
that's what we mean so we do a lot of

89
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,330
testing and a lot of smoking and I guess

90
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,620
in Amsterdam a lot of people are also

91
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,080
doing a lot of smoking and one of the

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,230
things that we smoke is Sipan and let's

93
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,630
see here and smoking Sipan means not

94
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,220
just running our own tests but instead

95
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,670
taking all of Sipan like all of Sipan

96
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,800
which is huge its massive it's used with

97
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,920
a why right

98
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,900
it's a Trump huge and huge and we we run

99
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,810
all of Sipan all of its tests of every

100
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,450
distribution that we can against Pro

101
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,250
just to see what's going to happen like

102
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,720
maybe we broke something we broke a

103
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
module so then we collect that

104
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,260
information that we've decided on it and

105
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,430
maybe we need to change something maybe

106
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,019
they need to change something and that's

107
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,500
what we do as well and stable releases

108
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,000
come out every single year so once a

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,620
year we take all of these and we throw

110
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,449
it out that is now a new state

111
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,580
version of pearl you can download it you

112
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,439
can run it you can move your company to

113
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,719
it you can upgrade all of that there are

114
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:40,180
a lot of ways to install pearl no a lot

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,020
of ways to get it

116
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,509
if using one of these distribution goo

117
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:46,059
new Linux or BSD or Solaris or HP X or

118
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,639
z/os or heard they're all supported Pro

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,309
supports a massive amount of operating

120
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:54,159
systems I'm not sure why but we do and

121
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,830
it's great so you can do that you can

122
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,509
also download strawberry Perl you can

123
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,219
also get active state and has active

124
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,839
Perl you can download those and use them

125
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,610
and they're meant for Windows they're

126
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,919
very good and you can also download and

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,469
install whatever version you want

128
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,509
locally on your machine on your own no

129
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,099
need for distribution just go to pearl

130
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:14,740
brute appeal this is a domain that's why

131
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,050
it is it looks like that and if you go

132
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,969
there you can just download this program

133
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,409
you can curl it straight to your bash

134
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,749
install it you can run your own Perl you

135
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:24,099
can update to a new version of Perl you

136
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,300
can try a development version of Perl

137
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,800
what did I say they say something bad

138
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,389
curl to bash well that's one of the ways

139
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,529
to install yeah it's fine okay security

140
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:41,860
I mean maybe okay now we also do a lot

141
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,939
of backporting there are mainly two

142
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,080
releases a Perl that we support at a

143
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,039
given time

144
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,810
currently it would be five twenty four

145
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,020
and five 22 we have just released 524

146
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,149
one which means a new version of that

147
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,580
stable branch and five twenty two three

148
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,930
which is a new version of that stable

149
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,279
branch and these collect additional

150
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,560
changes that we've done after we've

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,520
released the sablone

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,830
and this includes various things like

153
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,539
maybe we found a new security issue or

154
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,740
maybe we found the new bug fix there's

155
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,689
actually very important and we'll put

156
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,819
all those in one release and they

157
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,490
usually come out one month after the

158
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,770
stable release so 524 one in five twenty

159
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,810
two three were an odd one due to a

160
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,550
security consideration it took us a bit

161
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,310
a bit more time to get it done the way

162
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,949
we want it and they usually come out

163
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,539
like a month after so have twenty-four

164
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,599
one should come out a month after five

165
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,240
24:05 24 two will come out a month after

166
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,089
in 522 four will come out which will be

167
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,740
the very interesting the most confusing

168
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,500
combination will be five 24 2 and 5 22

169
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,540
for ok

170
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,020
so as the first problem of changing my

171
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,970
slide soothe steam this we have a lot of

172
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,280
considerations when we work on purl and

173
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,140
when we develop it and we make changes

174
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,480
not everyone agrees with us that is fine

175
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,520
but I want you to know what those are

176
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,070
first we care about consistency there

177
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,420
are a lot of suggestions things that

178
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,070
people say oh you should add this to

179
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,600
profile which is that this to profile

180
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,310
and sometimes but yeah that's it that's

181
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,200
actually a cool thing but sometimes it's

182
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,510
like that doesn't actually stay

183
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,520
consistent with the way pearl thinks you

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,050
can solve in this way it would be faster

185
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,240
it makes more sense this syntax doesn't

186
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,800
make sense this feature actually exists

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,270
over here so we try to keep it

188
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,070
consistent one of the biggest things

189
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,770
that we try to keep it compatible

190
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,440
compatibility is very very very hard we

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,140
strive for it but sometimes we have to

192
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,700
break it there are some things that are

193
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,800
more important the compatibility like

194
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,660
security recently we made a change

195
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,760
having to do with security not everyone

196
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,050
likes it I do feel bad but this is much

197
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,860
more important to us because you may not

198
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,030
appreciate that

199
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,400
now a line you wrote 17 years ago

200
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,470
doesn't work but at least it might not

201
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,100
cost the company 400 million so it's

202
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,540
very important we try to limit the

203
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,550
breakage that we caused so to have it as

204
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,410
little as possible but that is actually

205
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,410
not our prime most goal our prime goal

206
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,440
is to move the target move the language

207
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,170
forward we want to improve we want to

208
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,910
fix we want to optimize we want to make

209
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,770
it a language you keep using in the

210
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,290
future not just one that once you had it

211
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,120
there it won't ever change so nothing

212
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,370
will break so we try to do this well we

213
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,080
limit breakage it doesn't mean it won't

214
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,560
happen but we will be there when it does

215
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,080
so I keep using the word changes what

216
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,430
does it actually mean okay let's talk

217
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,740
about some changes I wanted to talk

218
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,559
about 524 526 so there are a bunch of

219
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,539
stuff that happened up until 524 not

220
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,770
everyone knows about them I really

221
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,940
really like them I wish I could talk

222
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,799
about them and I can because this talk

223
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,770
is about 524 and about 526 so here here

224
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,210
are a list of things that I'm not going

225
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,820
to talk about first I'm not gonna talk

226
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,830
about Unicode strings and what Unicode

227
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,470
strings does is a new pragma new not

228
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,650
really because it's existed before 524

229
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,320
it was improved

230
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,790
over time but basically what it does is

231
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,130
add full support of the unicode

232
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,840
semantics to all the string operations

233
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,490
and regex operations which is very very

234
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,020
useful if you use unicode which is

235
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,230
nowadays almost everyone we have custom

236
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,700
ops I'm not gonna talk about custom ops

237
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,320
what they allow you to do which is a

238
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
shame I couldn't talk about them is to

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,790
actually introduce new operations into

240
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,050
the OP tree which is really really wild

241
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,230
and fast and interesting there are also

242
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,550
pluggable keywords that allow you to

243
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,280
introduce parsing into Perl that you

244
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,290
write in Perl which then Pro over parts

245
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,240
using your Perl code in order to run the

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,150
Perl program that's kind of cool right

247
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,180
okay we can do this there's current sub

248
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
I like her and sub Steven mentioned in

249
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,800
the previous talk this is an example of

250
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,330
a very simple tree printer goes over one

251
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,440
know then it goes over the other node

252
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,700
you can write in different ways but this

253
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,180
is the naive implementation simple what

254
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,070
if we want to make it a purely

255
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,990
functional we just play with functions

256
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,530
the the problem here well as a callback

257
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,510
is that you can clearly see does anyone

258
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,400
spot the problem I think

259
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,550
where's yeah I I had Paul Evans point

260
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,590
out the memory leaks lacks timing is

261
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,810
this yeah it it closes over a variable

262
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,310
that doesn't exist yet because still

263
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,290
defining it so that won't work okay so

264
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,760
what we can do is define that variable

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,790
and then we can close over it except

266
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,120
this creates a closure in a memory leak

267
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,530
so that that's probably not that good

268
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,150
either there are ways to avoid memory

269
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,890
leaks using ref counting so we can just

270
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,620
break the ref count not a problem we

271
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,210
start with this program what we do is we

272
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,860
have the very long top we use this

273
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,720
scaler util function called weekend

274
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,060
which weakens the link between those two

275
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,650
references to basically make sure it

276
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,450
doesn't recurse into itself no problem

277
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,760
we weaken it we have a new variable and

278
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,460
we use that new variable except that

279
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,140
variable doesn't have a value so that

280
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,330
won't work so that doesn't that's not

281
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,060
good either okay not good there are

282
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,100
other ways to do this the best way is

283
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,510
actually to have a function that

284
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,070
receives a function and returns a new

285
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,000
function to that function

286
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,820
that would work we get into stuff like Y

287
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,410
Combinator's things like that it's kind

288
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,120
of confusing there's a simple way in

289
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,220
Perl nowadays let's just clean off

290
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,620
that's gone this is gone this is gone if

291
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,810
we call use feature current sub we can

292
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,150
just use that variable the way was and

293
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,150
use underscore sub everywhere and that's

294
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,300
it it's nicer that's much nicer I'm a

295
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,530
simpler you don't have to think and it

296
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,820
will always be the current self whether

297
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,470
it is a callback or whether it's just

298
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,240
the sub with a name you don't even have

299
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,090
to care it's nice I love this thing I

300
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,940
wish I could talk about it okay folk

301
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,190
case because anyone actually who here

302
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,560
speaks a foreign language importantly I

303
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,000
mean anything that Americans consider

304
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,780
foreign not English pretty much everyone

305
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,400
including an American here so Judy code

306
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,650
is hard because characters don't act the

307
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,680
way we assume they act in English they

308
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,270
act in different ways and in other

309
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,520
languages for example in German if you

310
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,320
try to do something like this that won't

311
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,290
work because German has multiple

312
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,050
characters for the same thing and it's

313
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,590
tricky and this this that won't work you

314
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,240
can't just lowercase two ones assume

315
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,290
it's the same one you might have another

316
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,090
character that's that's false so you

317
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,680
couldn't uppercase it either there is a

318
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,070
correct way to do this in Pro pro/5 the

319
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,870
theoretical century is unicode aware we

320
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,760
say the fully understands the concept of

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
unicode so if you say this is a

322
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,340
character and this the gary actually

323
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,200
knows where there's the same one so you

324
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,380
could do that what we need to do is

325
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,390
first to quote it so this says quote and

326
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,950
this says end quote which basically

327
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,080
means if this has any regex characters

328
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,610
in them don't turn it into a compound

329
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,350
regex it's just a bunch of characters

330
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,110
just use them as is and then we also

331
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,670
have to anchor them and the anchors are

332
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,740
actually different so it's confusing and

333
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,600
at the end this is the trick the

334
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,970
case-insensitive so upper case lower

335
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,630
case I don't care but you can remove all

336
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,510
of these and instead you can use FC fc's

337
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,430
fault case and what full case does is

338
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,680
folded in a way that is Unicode

339
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,130
case-insensitive that's fantastic can't

340
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,440
talk about it okay surprisingly enough

341
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,160
it was written by a guy named FC

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,290
we stands for father for sustenance but

343
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,120
everyone calls him FC cuz no one really

344
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
has the the effort of saying

345
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,959
Chrysostomos

346
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,810
okay weduc set operations that's already

347
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,440
in Pearl that's before 524 you can do

348
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,220
stuff like that

349
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,430
this is asking for a digit of either a

350
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,660
tie or Lewisham script this Plus on

351
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,540
these ampersand there it works you can

352
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,040
do a lot of stuff like that take all the

353
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,839
word characters except the lowercase

354
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,889
ones that works it's already available

355
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,269
lexical subroutines 30 and I love

356
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,620
lexical subroutines because they do

357
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,120
something really interesting let's say

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,360
we have an app here new we have some

359
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,759
kind of information attribute or method

360
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,860
and we want to call that getting either

361
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,560
the value or if there is no value we

362
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,750
want to call it this is great we want to

363
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,269
call the initialized value and we won

364
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,769
the initial ends value also set the

365
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,720
value and to return the value so in the

366
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,740
future it will be cached

367
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,720
I love parole it's like one line that's

368
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,079
it so we have this and you can clearly

369
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,449
see that we put an underscore in front

370
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:19,680
of initialize value to make sure it's

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,959
private right now no one can actually

372
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,199
call it it's safe no will find it no one

373
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,860
can call it but now what we can do is

374
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,899
put a my in front of it it's a lexical

375
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,360
sub now no one can call it

376
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,089
that's very nice it's very cool people

377
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,589
wanted this for a very long time we have

378
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:40,970
it and a lot of you're like oh really

379
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,779
yeah so I can't talk about

380
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,399
it's everything signatures which would

381
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,230
always always talk about we have

382
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,180
subroutine signatures take this small

383
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,209
function let's put two variables in

384
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,040
there for first and left left and right

385
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,529
and then use them directly or maybe you

386
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,940
want to have a third and this one says

387
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,700
you know what have a placeholder there

388
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,630
so I don't actually want to give it a

389
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,070
name but there is something there so

390
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,709
just make a note of that or maybe even

391
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,440
give it a default value or maybe use

392
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,390
something that already exists and also

393
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,589
change it every time why not or use

394
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,270
something that actually exists earlier

395
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,880
on that will work it will do that it

396
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,380
will use the first name from there as a

397
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,950
default for the nickname and of course

398
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,870
Slurpee and maybe you want to change

399
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,240
that into a hash that will work too and

400
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,170
these nice nice stuff that's kind of

401
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,870
nice key value slices I use key value

402
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,279
slices a lot how many people use key

403
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,190
value slices okay this is really nice

404
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,440
you can use it now and it's even better

405
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,190
so let's take this this array of days

406
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,450
how many times did you call a function

407
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,709
gets a date and then it gives you the

408
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,930
days and it's like 0 1 2 3 4 and you

409
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,660
have to figure out so we can take the

410
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,730
first and last it's a simple slice which

411
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,020
you see here is an app that basically

412
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,660
means in Perl this sigil pro/5 decidual

413
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,910
doesn't refer to what variable it is it

414
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,640
refers to what you want to receive back

415
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,140
what are you accessing this is I'm

416
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,540
accessing multiple things and it will

417
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,760
find using the identifier and this

418
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,550
access 1 with variable it is and what we

419
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,370
say is I want to get from this array two

420
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,880
items so no problem you get them they'll

421
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,850
be putting those two you can also give a

422
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,370
range I use this all the time I use this

423
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,440
all the time which I go to a hash and I

424
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,480
want to retrieve again multiple values

425
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,910
you can see this over here and I'll give

426
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,399
two keys and it will that's it this is

427
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
not new this is not new at all what also

428
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
isn't new is this new thing

429
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,069
which has existed before or 524 so let

430
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,149
me show you let's say we have a hash and

431
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,660
we want to get this what if I want also

432
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,399
the keys not just the values usually

433
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,589
what we do is do a map on the keys and

434
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,319
then get the key plus the right but what

435
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:57,420
we can do is take this pad that means

436
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,339
multiple but instead put it into a

437
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,079
percent that says I want multiple but I

438
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,869
want it as a subset of a hash and then

439
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,730
when we give the keys what it will

440
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,669
return is an actual subset of food and

441
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:09,959
bar including their keys and their

442
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,429
values super useful but it's not new you

443
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,409
already have this this is one of the

444
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,270
things that I use a lot I use this a lot

445
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,279
when I work with time I always want to

446
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,510
get the time and then it gives you all

447
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,029
the time in like an array and then you

448
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:25,409
have to figure out which one and the

449
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,449
month is seven and is it starting from

450
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:28,950
zero is it starting from and then I

451
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,110
created an array or a hash and then get

452
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,640
the right one it's very annoying but

453
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,399
it's that you can do stuff like that if

454
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,919
you give it an array you actually get

455
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,529
the index as a key she's also very

456
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:46,490
useful all right what else do we have

457
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,710
Stephen talked about this not new not a

458
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,840
lot of people using it let me give you a

459
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,330
few examples if we have an array ref we

460
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,950
can be written this way I personally

461
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,200
prefer dereferencing instead of just two

462
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,029
sigils together it's very confusing I

463
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,580
prefer to put braces on it to basically

464
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,059
say the array that this points to and if

465
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,350
you have something bigger you always

466
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,880
have to have them anyway but when you

467
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,409
have something bigger you usually write

468
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,419
it out and then you go back and wrap it

469
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,190
again but the postfix do you ref does

470
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,100
something different you go forward and

471
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,110
you dereference it on the spot at the

472
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,460
end by using these two characters the at

473
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
is for what you want the start is always

474
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,950
a start let's take this example I'm

475
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,909
going to go in get item 1 index 1 and

476
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,580
then I got to go back and wrap it or I

477
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,279
could just move forward 1 and arrow and

478
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,169
at start this is great at first it looks

479
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,490
really weird but then you start using it

480
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,169
and you don't want to give it up so it's

481
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,840
great another example I like this I

482
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,909
always do this

483
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,639
I can just continue move forward it's

484
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,099
great okay

485
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,960
variable aliasing via reference so pearl

486
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,879
has so many different types of variables

487
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,080
even though it seems like it doesn't it

488
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,609
has a lot of containers and it has a lot

489
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,259
of understanding of different types and

490
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,349
Pro also supports different ways to have

491
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,729
your containers like different scopes

492
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,200
for them so you have mine you have

493
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,460
locally have our and you have all these

494
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,139
things one of the things that pearl has

495
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:15,330
is aliasing which means two variables

496
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,559
that actually affect the same thing and

497
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,599
this is different than a ref a ref is

498
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,059
the same address so if you dereference

499
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,950
it you reach the same thing but a

500
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,830
referent an alias means literally two

501
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,499
scalars that are the same place in

502
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,149
memory they don't point to the same

503
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,720
place they are the same place if we

504
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,330
don't create an alias you just put a

505
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,849
backslash in front of the mind that

506
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,789
basically says bar is foo so when you

507
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,700
change bar over here this changes this

508
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,529
one which changes this one which

509
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,940
actually goes all the way to here and

510
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,029
foo is actually now two because it is

511
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,399
the same variable she's really really

512
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,929
nice because you can do it in loops

513
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,129
stuff like that we have improved this to

514
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:01,259
also allow the backslash right before

515
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,129
bar but that's actually new so I all

516
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:05,429
right

517
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,929
some opt-ins issues that we did do we

518
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,460
did a lot of optimizations think it's

519
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,799
very worth noting the optimizations that

520
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,149
we do in Perl they're very important

521
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,529
because our code runs much much much

522
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,960
faster the Pearl of yesteryear

523
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,019
is not as fast the pearl today so

524
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,129
integer allocations they're all faster

525
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,369
they are all faster by about 13% the guy

526
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,599
who worked on is actually right over

527
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,039
there so way to go Eric

528
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,990
because I mean who uses integers right

529
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,180
Eric also wrote a great blog post about

530
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,690
it which talks a bit about balancing

531
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,040
considerations when you program and it's

532
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,530
available at blog booking comm so he

533
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,850
also works a book on he wrote a blog

534
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,130
post about it really recommended we have

535
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,550
a regex

536
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,810
optimizer and looks at your regex and

537
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,640
try to optimize it we have copy and

538
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,890
write strict regular expression syntax

539
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,800
it's kind of kind of cool the multi drf

540
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,330
app is one of my favorite things because

541
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,240
we often use structures that are they're

542
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,490
not flat they they have a lot of depth

543
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,560
in them and the multi DRF op actually

544
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,840
avoids a lot of the problems with this

545
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,130
when it comes to speed I'm gonna give

546
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,530
you an example let's say that we have a

547
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,440
seat variable and let's see at the

548
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,170
bottom of it we have a hole and the

549
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,900
bottom of the hole there's a log and

550
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,400
there's a branch on the log at the

551
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,020
bottom in the hole in the bottom of the

552
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,760
sea and the what is it

553
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,880
branch at the edge of a branch I don't

554
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,290
even remember the thing and there's a

555
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,750
frog there and the frog has a tail and

556
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,730
on the tail there's the spec and the

557
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,920
spec there's a fleck which goes back

558
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,330
through this poem of there's a flak on

559
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,710
the spec and the tail and the Frog and

560
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,720
the bump of the branch and the log in

561
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,190
the hole in the bottom of the sea in

562
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,620
Pearl if pearl has to actually compile

563
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,630
this and Perl does compile it it looks

564
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,690
like this now this is a lot and there is

565
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,130
some cruft in it so I'm gonna clean it

566
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,960
up this is clean thank you for noticing

567
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,590
is that starting stopping whatever and

568
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,170
what you see here actually is the h LM

569
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,570
is hash element so go to your hash

570
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,610
element then he says are v2h movie says

571
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,890
take this reference value I like I'm

572
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,880
getting 15 minutes

573
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,170
we're very a lot of optimism here we're

574
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,410
getting reference value to hash value

575
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,480
and then so dereference it and then go

576
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,560
to a hash and then the reference that

577
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,510
and all of these are the actual constant

578
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,420
strings that pro has in there in 5:22

579
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,960
which is a version old this is how it

580
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
looks like of course there's also croft

581
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,720
so let me just clean that up for you

582
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,040
there we go

583
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,680
all right so yeah that's pretty damn

584
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,970
fast okay

585
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,670
CGI gone still available in Sipan thank

586
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,900
you 5:24 okay now I can actually start a

587
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,380
talk in 15 minutes so let's talk about

588
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,720
524 we removed some stuff I want to talk

589
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,710
about some of this stuff they removed

590
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,460
the pose the auto gear if the author

591
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,050
there was this idea there like if we

592
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,640
have references you could just do work

593
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,110
on the references themselves instead of

594
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,340
having dereference that would be amazing

595
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,770
sup no it wasn't you was not was not

596
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,400
amazing

597
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,770
so we've deprecated and now it's gone

598
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,610
removed the lexical topical variable was

599
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,710
a really interesting idea that almost

600
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,460
everyone misused by accident and we

601
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,990
realize it's actually adding more

602
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,790
confusion not helping we did the right

603
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,940
thing we said and then we removed

604
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,070
it so that's gone to this one there was

605
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,390
discussion about this it's a very good

606
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,040
example of how people will argue over

607
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,770
things that might not matter who can

608
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,720
tell me what our under my ex does i

609
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,830
double-dare you i won't be able to

610
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,790
actually tell if you're right or wrong

611
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,420
because i don't know same goes for my

612
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,120
and am i on an hour on am i and at some

613
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,020
way we just removed it like why have it

614
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,380
explicit false seach deer or deer to

615
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,540
your local directory your home directory

616
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,540
if you do this it fails if you do this

617
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,060
it fails which is very very good this

618
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,220
value was that mean catania sha lights

619
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,170
are initialized now if you actually want

620
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,400
to CH dear to your home directory

621
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,770
instead of by accident calling one of

622
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,320
these sort of things you just call

623
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,700
here like teeth simplicity okay some

624
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,560
fixes that we've done some of them very

625
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,540
important line numbering almost no one

626
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,280
uses but when you did and if you had

627
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,680
something long we had an integer

628
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,530
overflow fixed explosive braces are gone

629
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,120
this is an example usually would give

630
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,530
with color and then people would know

631
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,810
because of the color so what does this

632
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,020
do

633
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,560
two digits good this was not a trick

634
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,100
question what does this do this is a

635
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,520
trick question

636
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,040
digit in two braces opening close is it

637
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,550
obvious

638
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,710
nope what does this do

639
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,360
just braces okay it's a bit simpler mice

640
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,070
insects Hyatt er actually got it right

641
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,660
so people look at this and go I know it

642
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,260
does it's like okay not the point

643
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,760
so they're gone now you can't do this

644
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,860
anymore if you want to have an actual

645
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,090
brace just put it back slash okay so

646
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,550
yeah sorry I can't hear I can barely

647
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,800
well some of those are actually slowly

648
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,750
we're going over all of those to be

649
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,560
completely fixed all right the search

650
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,350
and replace in place which basically

651
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,270
this is we refer to this as pro Pi and

652
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,020
in Pro Pi the P and I along with the eat

653
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,640
it just gives you a certian place code

654
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,590
we change the contents of this file and

655
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,810
save it as it is it's very very useful

656
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,880
and and the eye actually receives a

657
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,230
parameter right here if you want for a

658
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,090
backup it's great except if you didn't

659
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,540
have enough space on this to do this

660
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,990
whoops

661
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,720
so that's fixed which is actually useful

662
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,010
who can tell me what that does right

663
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,240
this is does that help okay so it's it

664
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
this is good so far you're with me

665
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,889
excellent what does it do now

666
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,519
if anyone can actually go all the way

667
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,989
through I would appreciate you know it's

668
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:20,690
like two hours so previously this was

669
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,109
SEC fault just crash instead now I'm

670
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:26,479
gonna use a phrase that Ricardo sickness

671
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,159
the previous monkey really liked instead

672
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,570
now pearl is just gonna use all of your

673
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,779
memory and die which is the right thing

674
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,629
to do if you don't have enough no no no

675
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:40,489
so long some optimizations with in fact

676
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:41,719
went for now all of these are actually

677
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,909
in all this is in you already have it

678
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,219
for like almost a year now so okay

679
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,960
simple arithmetic SAR faster we need

680
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,409
your addition subtraction multiplication

681
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,479
all these are they're much faster now

682
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,909
like much much faster which is great we

683
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:58,070
rework the into our context stack which

684
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,779
doesn't mean anything to you unless we

685
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,149
broke your stuff but what it means to

686
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,830
everyone else is what we refer to as

687
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,269
cheaper subroutine calls which actually

688
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,830
means faster subroutine calls which

689
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,019
means any do use subroutines wouldn't

690
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,719
you like them to be like 30% faster they

691
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:15,469
are so 30% faster is for her as I

692
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,080
remember if you do any string matching

693
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,669
and regular expression and they are

694
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:23,029
fixed then they're much faster nowadays

695
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:24,169
which apparently this is how I have to

696
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,570
write emails to get people to read them

697
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,389
this is a true example some features

698
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,039
that we already have post fix the ref

699
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,479
that you saw that's it it's saying it's

700
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,460
not experimental it's in you can use it

701
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,190
it's good we restored amigo I support

702
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,190
now you realize that when I said like no

703
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,840
seriously supporting a lot of platforms

704
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,549
you know what I mean and so I was like

705
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:53,779
this breaks now when we were like oh it

706
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,399
wasn't that big but we fixed it unicode

707
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:56,929
eight it's already in it's already used

708
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:59,480
unicode nine came out after we finished

709
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,669
with 524 and it takes a while until five

710
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,380
twenty six is out so first one six

711
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,789
already has Unicode now it's kind of a

712
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:07,250
surprise but eight is already in some

713
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,870
stuff that eight provided is a lot of

714
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,520
stuff to most of us this doesn't mean a

715
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,750
lot but there are various people who

716
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,700
either research these languages or speak

717
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,409
these languages and now they can all use

718
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:17,299
it natively properly and not just

719
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,070
pictures and images and stuff like that

720
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,659
it's very important I want to give you

721
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,399
an example of what you can do in Perl

722
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,140
with Unicode it's really really nice so

723
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,049
if we use five 24s and tar names we take

724
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,429
zero with joyner would allow us to

725
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:30,440
create emojis that are combined from

726
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,539
different symbols and what we can do is

727
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:35,029
this is a concatenation of a BLEVE

728
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:36,770
Blackheart was just the type of heart

729
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,600
with a variation selector sixteenth does

730
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,399
anyone know what variation selects 16 is

731
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,880
nice Paul it's a bunch of characters put

732
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
together in two words no it's a it's a

733
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,029
color red so this makes a red heart

734
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,580
right by just contending the color and

735
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,399
the red in the in the heart image and

736
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,049
then we can make characters and we can

737
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,700
take additional characters we can just

738
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,340
use well encode just to ask the terminal

739
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,679
to use utf-8 and then we can just

740
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,260
combine them with the gr0 with joiner

741
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,419
and to create this image and I would

742
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:12,740
have shown you from the terminal but

743
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,360
Perl is more up-to-date than my terminal

744
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,059
so don't work and then I tried to use my

745
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,399
browser and none of my browsers are as

746
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,270
up-to-date as this like dead language

747
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,770
it's like come on Firefox give with the

748
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,149
program okay so the diversity system in

749
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:31,159
Unicode is actually already in so the

750
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,390
kind of stuff that I showed with the

751
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,250
colors you can do this with skin tones

752
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,610
using the Fitzpatrick skin tone scheme

753
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,649
which allows you to represent people as

754
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:42,289
who they are in their own flesh so to

755
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,149
speak rather than like an ambiguous

756
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,070
color which is very very important it's

757
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,809
the same for gender and stuff like that

758
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:49,940
these are really actual things that that

759
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,770
impact people but for most of us we kind

760
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,120
of fit that so we don't really care but

761
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,070
for a lot of people it does fit

762
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,970
for most of us in programming I guess so

763
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,420
if we take those modifier colors

764
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,890
Fitzpatrick ones are recognized and we

765
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,870
can just connect them together this is

766
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,000
from a book on a relationship that could

767
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,160
not exist before at the time that these

768
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,580
women existed and we can just create

769
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,740
these nice really really really nice

770
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,060
things so ok stop in five twenty six I'm

771
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,140
sort of reaching the end not really

772
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,700
five twenty six is coming out very very

773
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,460
soon it's coming out in April so you

774
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,350
already have it very very soon

775
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,900
what kind of stuff do we have in it we

776
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,300
have a bunch of fixes here some POSIX

777
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,330
temp name gone if you want use file temp

778
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,670
which you should have if you're using

779
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,130
this variable for encoding don't it's

780
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,040
bad if you want to anyway don't but if

781
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,510
you really really want to you can use

782
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,640
either filter encoding or encoding PM

783
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,290
has a filter so use those or just don't

784
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,270
when you did a require with two leading

785
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,110
colons that worked for some reason for

786
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,470
some value have worked gone the explicit

787
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,150
curly braces I mentioned that the xx so

788
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,150
you could put two x's and that's gone

789
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,320
and this is in crash anymore

790
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,690
if you add in type blobs that worst are

791
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,140
calling : : : : : you're safe now

792
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,650
more stuff we accidentally broke this in

793
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,320
518 so it was fixed we're sorry

794
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,020
and we're also discussing the concept of

795
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,910
skirt ones is anyone familiar with the

796
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,430
concept of security attacks on script

797
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,740
runs in unicode so it's kind of like

798
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,600
this crazy thing where we're thinking of

799
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,730
actually changing this and fixing it and

800
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,330
allowing someone to have a unicode check

801
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,130
a regex

802
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,280
check for unicode characters from the

803
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,750
same script run which is really

804
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,970
interesting it's not a problem in a

805
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,500
language it's just a problem that you

806
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,090
could like mistakes you can make and

807
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,880
this tries to help you with it and we've

808
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,770
removed Usenet from the documentation

809
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,860
because it geez okay some optimization

810
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,779
we did

811
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,669
there were constant strings are now

812
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:11,200
constant folded doesn't mean a lot other

813
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,809
than it's faster signature subroutines

814
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,159
have been optimized there are now as

815
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,590
fast as not having them which is already

816
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,359
a good reason to use them in the future

817
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,799
version there will be even more

818
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,929
optimized in the future we're hoping

819
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,369
that sovereignty signatures would be

820
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,840
faster than not using subroutine

821
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,789
signatures which will be a very good

822
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,710
reason to tell your boss that I just

823
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,200
have to use this really sweet syntax

824
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,299
because it's faster not because I want

825
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:39,279
to it's just faster and some

826
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,289
optimizations for locales in fate if

827
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:42,999
possible some stuff in your code 9

828
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:48,219
avvocato okay there's whiskey it was

829
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:49,419
like oh my god there's whiskey I'm like

830
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,690
now avvocato some actual things in your

831
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,159
code 9 all these people can now

832
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,539
represent themselves the way they are

833
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,219
and speak their native tongue the way it

834
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:58,629
is she's really nice and we can

835
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,279
investigate these languages and research

836
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,690
them much better so it's it's very

837
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,749
important very good some additional

838
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,129
features are that you need to code 9

839
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:08,109
syntax improvement to referencing and

840
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:09,489
mentioned that the backslash goes after

841
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,559
the mine we recognized version control

842
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,979
markers GCC does why shouldn't we

843
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:17,049
unicode now use the script extensions by

844
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:19,589
default it's more accurate we have the

845
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:23,139
constabulary teens very useful /x x is

846
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:25,119
actually repurposed and it means

847
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,710
something new i wouldn't give an example

848
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,369
these are two examples of regular

849
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,349
expressions and we obviously it's perl

850
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,089
we don't have to write this thing we can

851
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,519
just use the X and this gets expanded

852
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,789
this way right much better but with the

853
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,259
double X you can actually spend in

854
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:42,999
between those which is really really

855
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,710
nice because this becomes this and this

856
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,669
becomes you know you can see d te g 2i +

857
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:51,940
3 - 7 and if you expand this it looks

858
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,889
like this it's just way better so that's

859
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:56,469
just 2 X's you can have that in April

860
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:59,409
and indented here dogs it's about time I

861
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:01,210
read this all the time I have a help I

862
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,279
have a message it's an optional one so

863
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,109
if I have it I print an error and then I

864
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,940
try to print like a message using some

865
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,770
kind of here dog and then I write it

866
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,809
where I think it should be and then I

867
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:12,609
realize now I have to move it so it's

868
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,109
okay that doesn't work and then I put

869
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:17,168
the Terminator that no that won't work

870
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,029
so I have to move that again and now we

871
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:21,739
have this thing here do you see the here

872
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,679
right here beginning you we can now use

873
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,219
a tilt there and that will allow you to

874
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,320
gether to actually indent the here dog

875
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,020
to wherever you want and suddenly looks

876
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,869
like this it's much nicer right such a

877
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:41,080
pain okay thank you

878
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,418
the capture variable this is the kind of

879
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,770
things that are right all the time to

880
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,210
try and get them and then try to realize

881
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,679
their to get all of them and no I didn't

882
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,969
get all of them and then croak and then

883
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,080
how many did I get

884
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,639
and what if it's a question mark so

885
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,929
maybe I don't have a buzz and then I

886
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,879
actually have to do maybe have a default

887
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,680
for that and then check for it what you

888
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,990
can do now is just use the capture this

889
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,400
variable right there and gives you all

890
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,690
of them and you can use it as the number

891
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,190
to check there's a hash for it there's a

892
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,770
bunch of stuff new new things I gotta

893
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,930
have to rush this a little bit sorry and

894
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,430
script extensions already mentioned this

895
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,220
I think security we're removing dot from

896
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,390
Inc sorry it's actually important sorry

897
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,359
okay some futuristic stuff is actually

898
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:21,890
for the short five twenty eight and

899
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,140
above we have some ideas we have bug

900
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,670
fixes already that we know we're gonna

901
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,060
do like a lot we'd be fussing a lot so

902
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,500
we have a lot of information on various

903
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,170
things that crash it various

904
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,510
optimizations like a ton there's a lot

905
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,980
of affinity optimizations right now it's

906
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,420
gonna be way faster like the suburbs and

907
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,700
signatures I mentioned which will no

908
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,450
longer be experimental by the way the

909
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,609
hashing or is is going to be faster

910
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:48,410
maybe we'll have even be table hashes

911
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,030
and maybe we're gonna have a mop you

912
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,820
know like who knows we do hackathons we

913
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,290
started a first hackathon for the core

914
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,210
it was very very successful and we will

915
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,640
probably do more these are my parting

916
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,280
notes to you we want to get closer to

917
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
the community and understand the

918
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,070
relationship between the core and what

919
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,510
the community writes and that includes

920
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,400
for example the tool chain to make sure

921
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,170
that we're much more in sync about how

922
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,690
the coding core effects real-life usages

923
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,359
of it with Sipan itself and we want to

924
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,520
emphasize that that communication which

925
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,410
is always kind of a problem for for tech

926
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,109
people I mean it's annoying we're gonna

927
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:22,880
introduce deprecation specifically we've

928
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
introduced that there are no more empty

929
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,609
deprecations you don't get a warning

930
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:27,080
that says this has been deprecated

931
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,369
instead it says this isn't even

932
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,349
deprecated and will be removed in this

933
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,960
version so you can coordinate your

934
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,609
efforts and people really don't

935
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,739
like deprecations and i know it's

936
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:37,910
upsetting but think about this for a

937
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,749
second

938
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:41,509
when did bro 4 came out in 1991 Pro 5

939
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:45,259
came out in 1994 that was 23 years ago 5

940
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,640
6 in 2005 8 that a lot of people talk

941
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,220
about I think yes 2002 is 15 years ago

942
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,369
we can't have those programs necessarily

943
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,499
always a hundred percent percent

944
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:59,299
continue working nowadays especially if

945
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,039
we want to move the language forward I

946
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,289
want to keep using Perl in 10 years and

947
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,880
that means I will want the feature there

948
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,769
will need in 10 years to handle my

949
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:08,809
company's scale or my code scale and my

950
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,980
requirements in the future it's very

951
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,710
very important that we adapt to this

952
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,299
someone recently said why did you break

953
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,829
this it's been working said pearl 4

954
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:18,559
that's not a good claim that's it

955
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,420
doesn't convince me yet although that

956
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,980
one we did under perk 8 because there

957
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,509
was no reason to break it this is a

958
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:26,180
quote that I think is very important

959
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,999
Ted from OpenBSD said opinions vary as

960
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,259
to the cost associated with keeping

961
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:32,660
legacy code at the low end there is a

962
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,769
argument that if it's not the way

963
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,720
there's no harm at the high end ninth

964
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,369
capital went bankrupt after losing four

965
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,769
hundred million dollars in 45 minutes

966
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:41,630
after eight year-old the activity code

967
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,940
was accidentally reactivated it doesn't

968
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,920
mean start the leading stuff what he

969
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,569
means is there is a balance to a pole

970
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:50,869
that means that our policy on what we

971
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,119
call B BC which is bleed Pearl breaks

972
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,039
Sipan meaning we make a change in core

973
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,049
in the development version and Sipan

974
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:58,279
breaks there's a module that breaks

975
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,989
sometimes it's more than one what we do

976
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,420
nowadays is actually open a ticket with

977
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,279
the module author we decide whether we

978
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,539
were wrong or maybe they should update

979
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,430
their code we give it a grace period we

980
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,470
help them by submitting a patch we do

981
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,749
all of this nowadays and it's something

982
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,220
we're gonna continue doing I hope we're

983
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,980
going to communicate that even more last

984
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,099
rules on behavior this is my rules of

985
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,480
behavior and this is the rules of

986
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,890
behavior that we want to enforce

987
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,559
anywhere within the Perl 5 core

988
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,630
development and i really suggest within

989
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,239
the entire community first diversity and

990
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:34,130
inclusiveness is crucial be welcoming be

991
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,390
friendly be cooperative

992
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,640
what it means to have more people to be

993
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,920
inclusive to be diverse it means that

994
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,050
you get more eyes on a problem more

995
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,270
hands involved in helping you get more

996
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,070
skills you have more abilities different

997
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,540
skills and different abilities it's very

998
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,820
crucial to have you have better code

999
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,200
eventually because more people see it

1000
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,700
more people can act on it people think

1001
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,290
differently and it means your code is

1002
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,730
stronger you can handle more things

1003
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,800
there's actually a very valuable code

1004
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,510
wise thing as well it's very practical

1005
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,010
to have and obviously better

1006
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,860
documentation and better testing which

1007
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,210
are all very very important if we

1008
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,860
actually want continuing of course just

1009
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,170
like a much bigger community because I

1010
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,030
am involved in versus communities just

1011
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,860
because I enjoy it and if I would enjoy

1012
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,430
I wouldn't be involved so if we want to

1013
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,260
have an even bigger one should be like

1014
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,050
the most fun community ever and we can

1015
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,490
be on the up side abuse is not helpful

1016
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,840
ever ever ever ever ever no one ever

1017
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,140
said man I'm happy I made that person

1018
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,080
feel really bad about themselves ever

1019
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,330
you have to be a vindictive horrible

1020
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,790
person to enjoy that that's the kind of

1021
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,980
behavior we don't accept anymore and we

1022
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,730
shouldn't ever Wendy just said why be

1023
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:53,320
nasty like why and bitterness begets

1024
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,230
bitterness so code as difficult as it is

1025
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,300
for me and code is sometimes very

1026
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,170
difficult for me

1027
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,020
bitterness is harder because I can deal

1028
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,360
with hard code it's like it's just hard

1029
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,100
if I get help I might be able to resolve

1030
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,080
it but if someone's bitter it attacks

1031
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,170
your very being just let it go a really

1032
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,430
good sentence the best way to predict

1033
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,520
the future is to create it go to pro/5

1034
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,490
porter's it's a mailing list you can

1035
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,900
join you can hear what's going on you

1036
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,150
can talk to us you can also read the

1037
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,790
summaries at all of these places I tried

1038
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,380
to summarize every single week what was

1039
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,120
going on what tickets we have new old

1040
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,440
fixed discussions we've had and I think

1041
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,960
this is the last sentence I have let's

1042
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,490
make each other proud someone said it

1043
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,050
somewhere to someone else probably or a

1044
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,900
better yet be excellent to each other by

1045
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,360
Abraham Lincoln of course from the Bill

1046
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,880
& Ted movie but you know

1047
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,240
still works right thank you very much

1048
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,790
you
