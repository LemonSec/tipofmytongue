1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,809
Forrester

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:22,070
French open source started with sip

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,619
communicator they grew into gypsy and

4
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,210
headed off into video created real cool

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,489
video server I think you want to speak

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,600
about yeah friend song

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:44,210
oh thanks Zoe well hi everyone

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,039
this first talk quick show of hands who

9
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,769
knows what deetzes is or stands for Wow

10
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:52,760
okay well then I can skip real quick for

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,280
the fear of you who don't know it's a

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,679
collection of software open-source

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,260
software that allows us to have scalable

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,749
and secure multi-party video conferences

15
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:06,260
so the hallmark of this collection of

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,050
project is called dizzy meet and this is

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,160
how it looks like this is our weekly our

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,350
daily stand-up story where we all

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,910
everyone in the clean connects and

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,310
shares what the hell we're doing so as

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,920
you can imagine connecting like 12v new

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
streams all together has a certain

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,330
degree of difficulty and the idea is

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,950
that we take care of that for you so you

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,230
don't have to worry about it and they're

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,600
gonna let you know how we achieve these

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,610
and we're going to see how you can also

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,800
do it for yourself without having to do

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,160
everything from scratch one important

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,680
thing that happened is my t-shirt which

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,650
is did c.join Glaceon roughly two years

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,670
ago in 2015 and it got integrated into

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,250
some of their proprietary products our

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,130
write our products now so one of which

35
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,710
for example is hip chest which is a

36
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,810
proprietary group chat application but

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,810
the video part is done we are the same

38
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,600
way we do our video conferencing so VR

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,110
DC meet we also have a company-wide

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,629
All Hands meeting where all the officers

41
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,030
connect together the founders gave us

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,190
some updates some presentations are

43
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,239
shared

44
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,870
so on and so forth so this integration

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,609
of jits into Atlas and actually

46
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,859
empowered us to basically go a little

47
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:28,040
bit further scale-up better and

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,650
basically build these things that maybe

49
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,109
before we either didn't have the idea to

50
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,500
do or necessarily all the tools now we

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,379
have these resources these needs we can

52
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,930
do that and we can do that actually

53
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,510
while being a fully open source project

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,939
which is a nice thing to keep everything

55
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,159
is available as open source in the

56
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,049
digital work website we host a bi-weekly

57
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,819
community conference call where we share

58
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,769
like what's the plan what we're working

59
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,840
on and actually I'm here today to

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,909
basically tell you a little bit more

61
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:05,329
about this but actually doesn't stop

62
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,950
there so there are other companies both

63
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,709
for-profit and not-for-profit that are

64
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,579
using our tools to build the products

65
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,889
one such company is high five they sell

66
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,500
these hardware and software based video

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,319
conferencing solution and they use one

68
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,900
of our pieces of software that a DC

69
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,669
video bridge the video bridge is the

70
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,040
entity responsible for routing the video

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,260
to all participants and being the smart

72
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,180
guy in the room which knows what kind of

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,489
video has to be arrived to what person

74
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,370
depending on its bandwidth needs and so

75
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,319
on another sort of instance of this is

76
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,129
mid GT is our publicly available

77
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,500
instance so this one you can use to hold

78
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,079
your meetings share your desktop it's

79
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,659
fully functional you can use it it's

80
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,750
hosted by us and more than that it has

81
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,030
an external API which can be used to

82
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,579
embed mid ditsy into your own

83
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,620
applications without necessarily needing

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,810
to post the instance yourself if you

85
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,159
don't want to do that one such case is

86
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,579
rocket chat which is an open source

87
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,639
group chat application which added video

88
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,039
support by embedding DEET in it so have

89
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,680
these high level API we call the iframe

90
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,409
API which allows you to customize how

91
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,740
you want to actually see these

92
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,860
multi-party video conferencing

93
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,020
you know the view the experience you can

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,060
change things around and maybe the kind

95
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,129
of application you have in mind doesn't

96
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,349
necessarily need a large view here and

97
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,659
you want to go with judge the thumbnails

98
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,879
or the filmstrip as we call it so you

99
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,099
can customize this when you use this

100
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,189
embedding API to make your application

101
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,379
be you know multi-party video

102
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,039
conferencing enabled so what is sort of

103
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,009
everything that this thing does which

104
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,719
you may be aware of some of the things

105
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:01,020
and not some others so we can do we can

106
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,840
of course the video but that video can

107
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,580
be your desktop so we can do this too

108
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,069
sharing your conferences can be recorded

109
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,319
or streamed to YouTube for instance this

110
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,840
is how we do the company-wide All Hands

111
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,210
we stream it to YouTube so that way you

112
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,210
can imagine that maybe in a different

113
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,919
scenario you like okay I need a million

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,139
people to join the room well that might

115
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,849
be a bit of hard on your chrome instance

116
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:27,449
so how about you stream it to YouTube

117
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:29,009
and then you can have as many viewers as

118
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,389
you want if they don't need to

119
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,610
participate for instance or you can

120
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,190
watch the recording later as well it's

121
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,080
fully anonymous as well if you want to

122
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,000
so you don't need to basically sign up

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,370
or put any data out you just go for it

124
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,529
use it and that's it there's an

125
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,560
integrated chat in it we can do

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,270
collaborative document editing with iPad

127
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,120
there's a calendar invitations plugin

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,319
which I'm going to show you this

129
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,819
basically allows you if you're using

130
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,520
Google Calendar for instance you can

131
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,069
schedule a meeting and really quickly

132
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,560
create a Aditi meeting room so that

133
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,150
that's where the meeting would kind of

134
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,060
virtually take place we can invite other

135
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,069
participants but just sharing the URL so

136
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,990
you can share it via email or whatever

137
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,060
other means and I love that kind of -

138
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,439
well two important ones for last let's

139
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,949
say so simulcast is the ability to

140
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,259
forward just the specifically relevant

141
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,360
video to its participant so in the image

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,610
we saw before with 12 people you can

143
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,400
imagine that we cannot handle like well

144
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,110
not cannot but your bandwidth cannot

145
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,029
handle 12 to 15 let's say Full HD video

146
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,069
streams so why do we do well turns out

147
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,600
that each participant will

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,510
and three or two or three different

149
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,370
resolutions and will this pick the

150
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,950
appropriate one to forward so if you are

151
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
on the large of you then of course we're

152
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,370
wondering full-hd but if you're in a

153
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,470
thumbnail we can do fine with a much

154
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,660
smaller resolution which takes a lot

155
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,240
less CPU less bandwidth and so on so we

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,840
use a combination of techniques here

157
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,480
simulcast a little bit of SVC also to

158
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,650
cut down on the frame rates in some

159
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,140
cases and also what we call the last end

160
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,630
which means you don't necessarily need

161
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,610
to receive all the participants

162
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,350
information because maybe they are not

163
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,000
active in the conference so you can

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
basically escape the non active

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,750
participants and only get the last end

166
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,180
active participants and this way you

167
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,740
also save again bandwidth CPU and mobile

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,960
apps so that's actually where one of the

169
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,650
things are actively working on right now

170
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,660
we haven't announced them yet but they

171
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,240
are in the Apple Store and the Play

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,610
Store you just have to put the right

173
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,060
name in did see me and you will get the

174
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,940
thing that way you can just enter the

175
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,530
conference room name here if you have

176
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,270
your own deployment you can enter a full

177
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,790
URL and it will also work and you just

178
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,980
join the conference and participate via

179
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,260
your mobile application now mobile

180
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,880
applications are also open source turns

181
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,870
out just like the other things so you

182
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,280
can go ahead and github actually that's

183
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,860
where we do all our work in the open for

184
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,830
request reviews and so on and you can

185
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,690
either build them yourself if you want

186
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,400
to get them from the store

187
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,130
code is out there now you're probably

188
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,680
thinking well cool story sold but that

189
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,820
one hosted myself so how do I so the

190
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,000
plan for now is I'm going to start with

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
my destroyed development virtual machine

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,090
and build it up again so that we have it

193
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,620
running and hopefully some of you guys

194
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,299
can join the meeting so this whole thing

195
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,310
requires a number of moving parts a

196
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,340
number of components to have our DC meet

197
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,530
infrastructure you mean webserver view

198
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,440
and XMPP service

199
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,030
anything about that sympathy well not

200
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,380
really but it turns out it's just

201
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,340
internally so we need a setup there but

202
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,380
the idea is that we should do these us

203
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,080
with as little configuration as possible

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,940
so it's more approachable for everyone

205
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,710
hopefully that's what I'm going to show

206
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:18,100
you me with any luck so let's see so

207
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,360
let's do a ring and the first thing you

208
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,510
need is double check that the thing

209
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,720
doesn't work all I have on my server is

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,630
nginx and some SSL certificates in a

211
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,630
folder this is my server there are many

212
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,500
but this one is mine

213
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,660
so I can just stop the installed you to

214
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,230
meet I know the this is a sorry this is

215
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,500
an Ubuntu system so we have packages for

216
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,320
Debian and Ubuntu so we have to enter

217
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,040
some information like on what domain

218
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,630
we're hosting this this will create the

219
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,600
necessary configuration is reachable via

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,829
nginx we can opt to create a self-signed

221
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,470
certificate but Danna gives us the

222
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,510
annoying warning in chrome so let's do

223
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,540
that I have my own cert so let's do that

224
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,470
instead is it going to ask for it right

225
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:31,209
now so because it dad I have the key and

226
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:34,349
the cert on the same place

227
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,440
we install it and we should off to the

228
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,270
races

229
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,450
well result we are so let's join the

230
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,100
room it's called fast and can anyone in

231
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,020
the room with a lot to join me here

232
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:02,570
akiko-san hello something went wrong but

233
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,460
they are trying to fix it so it's okay

234
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,760
whoever they are

235
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,510
okay so we got another fellow Jutes here

236
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,340
here which joined and I don't know

237
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,930
another guy doesn't want to show their

238
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,600
face so this is the main did see main

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,070
interface oh okay

240
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,690
no we're bored here let's see how how

241
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,270
the Wi-Fi holds so what can we do from

242
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,490
here well so if you're collaborating

243
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,470
with multiple people you may want to you

244
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,090
know take turns and like raise your hand

245
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,160
and stuff when you when you want to do

246
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,410
something here we can share it to

247
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,720
YouTube if we have an API key we have an

248
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,550
embedded chat like we can choose a

249
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:53,380
nickname here and say and then you know

250
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,240
my child real quick here so it's a

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,490
participant here alright so this is

252
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,040
basically all happening on serving

253
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,170
Ireland is the forwarding happening and

254
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,410
here for each participant we have we

255
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,970
have some information which we can cover

256
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,450
on we're not receiving him and you see

257
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,700
how we're just receiving in tiny little

258
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,760
thumbnail 180 P nothing really

259
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,530
so this is happening all in the WebRTC

260
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,670
domain but sometimes you just got up you

261
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,620
just gotta go for the PSTN you know good

262
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,850
old landlines and stuff so we also have

263
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,709
again past which is called the gossip it

264
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,839
stands for ditzy gateway percept and

265
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,579
that way we can actually join via set so

266
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,629
we need to configure sip address that is

267
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,369
the one which is going to receive

268
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:56,329
incoming calls so have like a sip

269
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,439
address from a French operator or third

270
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,779
one and let's see there's a default room

271
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,489
configured so I'm going to exit this

272
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:12,859
fosston thing and then enter my sick

273
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,059
best room so my microphone is bad

274
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,269
why

275
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,200
oh can you please not enter this one

276
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,140
because I'm going to enter with a phone

277
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,980
so in this room I can just take out my

278
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,880
mobile here and use the phone

279
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,700
application which is usually hidden

280
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,550
somewhere because you don't need it and

281
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,650
stuff and we then you like there we go

282
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,070
so we are in the mobile phone in this

283
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,100
web RTC multi-party conference if

284
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,170
somebody joins the audio is also a

285
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,600
so everybody basically what you guys

286
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,220
will do is receive all the earlier for

287
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,680
every participant makes it in so we have

288
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,710
it in here so this way we can really

289
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,410
easily branch out to either all sip

290
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,620
legacy sim devices even the PST and

291
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,730
whatever and you can use it it like that

292
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,000
old IBM ID said it connects anything to

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,840
everything so God work so what's next

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,450
then what are we working on we're

295
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,810
working on the perk with the perk ITF

296
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,940
working group to have fully end-to-end

297
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,720
encrypted conference calls so this is

298
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,000
quite tricky it requires that you use

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,420
SRTP twice like you double encrypt and

300
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,730
so far nobody has it as in we are

301
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,590
working with someone which is doing a

302
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,540
modified version of Chrome and hopefully

303
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,610
this makes it once the standards

304
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,320
stabilize the one can use it we're

305
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,510
providing this we're also working on

306
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,670
simulcast adaptivity so basically trying

307
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,220
to better adapt to changing network

308
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,550
conditions to dynamically change these

309
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,960
number four this means you get or

310
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,910
different resolutions try to be more

311
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,120
smart in this smarter in this department

312
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,620
we're also working on an optimization

313
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,620
for when you are calling one-on-one so

314
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,750
when you're just two participants we

315
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,460
will try to bypass the bridge and

316
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,230
basically have a direct connection

317
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,480
between us if we can do that without any

318
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,900
turn service

319
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,730
you heard a first talk by the Marquess

320
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,650
you'll see that well that's not always

321
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,050
possible but if it's possible we'll go

322
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,830
one-on-one

323
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,250
but then when a third person joy will go

324
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,220
to the bridge so that we work together

325
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,450
and then we're also doing some working

326
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,920
eyes mobility

327
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,710
basically if connection changes we need

328
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,010
to survive and and continue our call

329
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,810
without being disrupted by this

330
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,360
connection changes and of course our

331
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,760
mobile operations and applications

332
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,750
efforts are also in full swing

333
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,580
good that's all I got got any questions

334
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,550
I'm here now and tomorrow and that's the

335
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,280
pretty things as I said it's alright

336
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
yeah it's already there you go to the GT

337
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,880
meat repository and the code is there

338
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,950
because the website and the applications

339
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,340
share a lot of the code so justice' fun

340
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,190
trivia fact where the web application is

341
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,310
is now gearing towards rewrite in react

342
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,170
and the mobile is built with react

343
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,830
native so we're we're unifying all in a

344
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,920
single direction and there's also

345
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,330
document on how to build them if you

346
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,110
want to do it yourself

347
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:47,120
right so if you have just it for oh

348
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,330
sorry

349
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,420
okay I'll repeat the question which is

350
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,520
if we're doing releases because updating

351
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,620
manually can people even know what to

352
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,080
expect so I don't disagree with you

353
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,760
right now the thing is all of these

354
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,650
projects they are somewhat intertwined

355
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,050
together as in if you want to implement

356
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,760
something it's possible that it touches

357
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,350
multiple projects and you need them to

358
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,290
work in tandem so we have Jenkins test

359
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,330
everything together and tag each repo so

360
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,760
if you use the same tag across all the

361
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,030
repos that's the working set now that

362
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,580
said that you have followed along GT me

363
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,920
for a while you probably know that it

364
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,690
pretty much didn't change all that much

365
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,060
in how it works it basically keeps on

366
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,730
improving so that is the idea it's a

367
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,480
little bit of a rolling kind of thing so

368
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,370
if we think about doing stable releases

369
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,870
well what does a stable mean because we

370
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,130
have to change things all the time

371
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,420
because chrome changed things all the

372
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,040
time and Firefox changes things all the

373
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,280
time

374
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,440
they are moving targets so we try to

375
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,650
adjust and it's a little bit hard to set

376
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,720
the point where this thing is ready now

377
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,390
because the thing is ready right now but

378
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,580
if we look tomorrow it may not be

379
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,420
because some things have changed so it's

380
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,010
like we this perk thing is happening

381
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,960
right now and it's probably going to

382
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,420
involve a little bit more before it gets

383
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,840
there so if you look at for instance

384
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,540
browser releases and this has to be very

385
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,510
close to browsers because those are the

386
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,420
main end points here they move so damn

387
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,990
fast

388
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,840
that they don't make releases more like

389
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,820
if you're using five older versions of

390
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,200
Chrome it's like what are you in

391
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,500
prehistoric times so it's a little bit I

392
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,050
understand your pain point that's why we

393
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,679
have these packages that basically do it

394
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,500
for you you have to do it by source all

395
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,690
I can tell you at the moment because I

396
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,580
don't have a better answer is that you

397
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,169
have to see all the tags together

398
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,359
[Music]

399
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,100
we have regression tests and everything

400
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,990
runs on Jenkins so what mark we said

401
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,020
actually it testing is not built into

402
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,540
web RTC but you can do it and we do it

403
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,280
so we don't release something that is

404
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,110
broken like if it's not green on our

405
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,970
screen they're hanging from the office

406
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,460
it doesn't go out now of course there's

407
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,800
always things that are unexpected that

408
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,960
we can't test for the unexpected we're

409
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:41,440
not perfect yes we do and it's it should

410
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
be coming up soon so I haven't

411
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,370
personally working a little bit on that

412
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,810
on one part of this I'm hoping to give a

413
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,970
talk on these things later in the year

414
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,790
once it's a little bit more ready but we

415
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,730
do have a plan and a working prototype

416
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,730
on how to do this for legacy depend

417
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,860
points that can only do a one to one

418
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,750
video call to have everybody join

419
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,260
Congress

420
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,679
