1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,970
[Music]

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,399
yeah I do it to sex it up walking

3
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,970
no tons of data better better better

4
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,210
better

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,170
okay

6
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,290
[Applause]

7
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,710
it looks like fill up again this time so

8
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,180
if there are any seats in the middle

9
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,080
please

10
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,740
[Music]

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,709
[Applause]

12
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:44,670
good morning to that so that's an

13
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,160
Ethernet switch basically initially

14
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,010
which was no more than what was called a

15
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,530
 something to for friends between

16
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,600
Leslie to wires

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,130
you can't just connect two wires

18
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,840
together so you had something like

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,140
there's something called a bridge which

20
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,269
was initiated you still feel like I

21
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,160
weigh Peter something like that to

22
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,299
stretch the length of any to run but of

23
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,230
course that was very limited you can you

24
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,390
know you can only connect to two lines

25
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,200
to a page

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,480
so therefore multiple bridges I have

27
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,430
started coming in that's we're talking

28
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,870
about like thirty four years ago by the

29
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,930
way so multiple bridge formerly known as

30
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,390
you get a packet in a whimper and it

31
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,980
just gives it up to all the other parts

32
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,510
so and I just became very very fast

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,840
because obviously they tended to just

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,880
generate a lot of traffic we didn't need

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,730
to go so in Kim switches but our

36
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,790
switches for me as different as

37
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,569
[Music]

38
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,550
essentially they haven't actually be

39
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,310
affording database it does learning and

40
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,239
aging of max that means it's either

41
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,730
pocket come in on one port and you

42
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,760
thought packet a frame so it remembers

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,000
that the source McIver's came on that

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,459
put and therefore if it ever gets that

45
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,918
thing destined for that MAC address we

46
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,720
will send that out to that portal yeah

47
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,478
it'll do that by showing that entry and

48
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,690
fdv just MAC address port that's best of

49
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,330
the essentials investor the least of LF

50
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:34,139
DVD and keep a timer and if if it hasn't

51
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,419
seen a packet from two five minutes or

52
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,060
okay you said like five minutes left

53
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:59,960
you see a packet come in but generate

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,790
any traffic you should age it out

55
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:10,570
because and therefore you should

56
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,670
[Music]

57
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,900
afterwards was very important it's about

58
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,480
to segment your switches lots of ways to

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,290
do VLANs

60
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,680
that you can you can do the v/line

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,250
priority tagging as verified in a or 201

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,920
queue the standard or you can just do a

63
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,410
partition switch where you don't have

64
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,080
any extra tags on your ethernet frames

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,650
but basically you configure your switch

66
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,150
to be like the two difference which is

67
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,820
three different switches and if you want

68
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,710
to have for a traffic between those

69
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,300
partitions you actually have to connect

70
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,840
the wire so that's the basics of an

71
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,540
Ethernet switch right now a new switch

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,150
or an emulation of it you might say and

73
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,060
in the kernel for a long time

74
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,150
the bad was of course a software thing

75
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,720
and you use a bunch of next basically

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,970
you put a bunch of cards you put like

77
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,790
four or whatever

78
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,770
cards in your in your server and you can

79
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,590
configure a bridge a software bridge and

80
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,140
then you know it's kind of FTB all and

81
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,130
put mountain in the kernel and you can

82
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,800
you know frames between them things like

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,620
that and and wrap them out to a P&O

84
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,450
Ferries systems account as needed

85
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,030
but of course there are some limitations

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,880
that first off everything is done by CPU

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,920
so you need need the actual general

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,250
purpose CPU to do a bunch of comparing

89
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,690
of friends than MAC addresses looking up

90
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,170
in dftb and it's not super efficient

91
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,790
switches tend to be a lot more

92
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,670
specialized specialized memory typically

93
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,550
for implementing an FTB that just makes

94
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,390
it faster to do lookups another thing of

95
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,150
course is these things tend to be i/o

96
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,430
bound initially in Linux getting a frame

97
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,430
on an hour neck meant getting an

98
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,480
interrupt on your CPU to interact with

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,560
them cause the curl to receive the frame

100
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
from the neck but of course too many

101
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,940
trucks kind of kind of ruins you

102
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,370
performance anyway that was solved a

103
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,950
long time ago where I forget what that's

104
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,780
called what was that that system called

105
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,559
that's it

106
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:01,999
they're basically just having more than

107
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,929
one frame per interrupt but of course

108
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,449
you've still got the same problem as

109
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,649
long as the coil is is doing all this

110
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,019
manual work on a you know general

111
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,979
purpose CPU it's not going to be super

112
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:24,549
super performant right now so then

113
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:28,419
something interesting started happening

114
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,889
and switches started coming out starting

115
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,629
with the venerable wrt54g and of course

116
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:42,458
threatened WT project came and now these

117
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,040
really kind of very specialized small

118
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,000
CPUs better have a built-in switch chip

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,069
that means typically something like five

120
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,649
Ethernet ports and you can configure

121
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,170
those switch chips to actually do

122
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,670
switching between them in other words

123
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,910
you program their FDB you program the

124
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,279
switches RTB so that if it gets a frame

125
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,750
from one court it could actually no sir

126
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,689
I don't need to send that to the CPU

127
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:20,860
there's much more much more interesting

128
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,110
where the CPU really isn't that strong

129
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,230
it really you can't really do CPU

130
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,930
switching on last time so there may be a

131
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,139
key project needed a way to configure

132
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,350
those chips in there the problem of

133
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,959
course was that you can't just use

134
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,500
defender

135
00:09:45,490 --> 00:11:10,730
because but it was just you know random

136
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,660
stuff that's supported by chips some

137
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,029
great features sometimes I'm not sure W

138
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,830
config really supports them all but you

139
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,700
know the problem with that was that SW

140
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,080
conflict was never up streamed to the

141
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,779
mainline kernel I'm not entirely sure if

142
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,180
an open WT product tried to upstream it

143
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,010
was refused or if they didn't bother

144
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,800
maybe somebody here knows somebody's on

145
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,470
the

146
00:11:37,470 --> 00:12:03,660
no didn't you tried I said how could

147
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,899
says that it was try to submit upstream

148
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,910
to the mainline kernel but it was my

149
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,010
last refused because there was the car

150
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,680
was starting to get something similar

151
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,950
and that was the DSA subsystem the DSM

152
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,670
system stands for distributed switch

153
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,680
architecture really kind of comes from

154
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,290
future present involve several switch

155
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,220
steps the MV 8 80 series chips which I

156
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,130
think we originally there at L switch

157
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,080
subdivision I think the more tougher

158
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:47,680
more gorgeous product actually I was

159
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,899
pretty generic you could do lots of

160
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:58,060
other things with it and welcome drivers

161
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,220
were submitted for p53 series and the

162
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,190
Starfighter to which I've many of these

163
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,399
small chips we found several others I

164
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,959
see there's a clock and address switch

165
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,410
supporters well eight five five three a

166
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,029
believe they present series anyway so

167
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:25,230
there's two sorts of Aryan

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:50,760
this is it that means if you have to

169
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,990
[Applause]

170
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:26,560
that's really important switching if you

171
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:46,510
can fix in your system and just behind

172
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,850
the scenes actual switching happens in

173
00:14:48,850 --> 00:15:02,520
hardware that's really important but

174
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,800
there's lots of other ways to connect

175
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,870
you know if they'll switch is to your

176
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,010
system as many as there are message that

177
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,350
and there's enough presses so don't to

178
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,580
switch to a system kimmm

179
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,080
the system is a process to subsystem

180
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,720
that means if you can invoke it from any

181
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,520
present on a PC I bus PCI Express bus

182
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,220
that makes it of course more interesting

183
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,860
to the higher end type of switch ships

184
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,170
that need the kind of bandwidth that PCI

185
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:48,940
Express uses it's a very generic system

186
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,150
right it's more generic than ESA that

187
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,060
means that DSA was essentially changed

188
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,220
to DSA substance and essentially changed

189
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,970
in the car to be a switch deaf driver

190
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,829
right to DSS so there there are still

191
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,050
BSA drivers could BSA the framework

192
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,360
itself is essentially a switch that

193
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,730
driver if you want to do support

194
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:22,980
switching support for supported switch

195
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,170
switch side and the correct now right

196
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,500
that's kind of its kind of emulate or

197
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,820
switched up you might see it that way

198
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,530
right now it's kind of the easiest way

199
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,839
right but switch Levin general is super

200
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,430
generic it's got standard operations to

201
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,280
work on your f DB so odd entries each

202
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,890
entry set aging time and value several

203
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,779
parameters

204
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,910
as well support so mid to cast caching

205
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,149
caching and things like that announces

206
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:58,569
well

207
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:05,069
setting up VLANs let's switch that and

208
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,020
this happened last year is that switch

209
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,250
I've got merged before anything DSA was

210
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,740
supported but at some point last year a

211
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,619
Mellanox vendor very high-end Swift

212
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,520
ships submitted Jarvis further switch x2

213
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,280
and then their spectrum switch chips IV

214
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,190
they're super super high-end right the

215
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,880
spectrum has 48 of 6.4 terabit per

216
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,820
second to give you some idea that's

217
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,370
that's basically you can have a 32 perks

218
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,020
which report 100 gigabit doing full

219
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,980
duplex on every port constantly and this

220
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,309
thing can handle it right you can use a

221
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,700
switch

222
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,710
with the spectrum chip in it or the

223
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,850
switch excuse chip in it right now in

224
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:10,210
the mainland corner doing a just on the

225
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,150
main line curl standard driver using the

226
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,450
standard tools up here to bridge all

227
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,270
that stuff that's magic right so with

228
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,670
more likes that is very much it's very

229
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:33,040
much a pioneering thing I think you nice

230
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,200
if code would follow take a small

231
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,960
miracle but sort of on the fence about

232
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,990
this you might say between somewhere in

233
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,790
the spectrum between Mellanox are

234
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,070
welcome there are a lot of elements

235
00:18:50,070 --> 00:19:10,179
caveum seems kind of interesting include

236
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,850
net switch technology that's the entire

237
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,490
API it's super simple

238
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,440
because just so generic I encourage you

239
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
to take a look at it so that's all about

240
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,649
any questions

241
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,370
that's just a treble switching capacity

242
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,529
of the spectrum chip the Mohawks

243

spectrum chopper system for turbot I

244
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,610
don't know from bowel marks or anything

245
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,580
I don't mean to have you know but I'm

246
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,500
just saying that's a real hardship it

247
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,960
has a total switching capacity of 16

248
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:05,399
footer better marketing literature I

249
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:10,860
assume it's correct any other questions

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,420
have questions okay thank you

yes

maybe it's the simplest blinking that's

my battery

259

yeah keep it sir

260
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,960
my sense

261
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,840
Aradia endorphin switching in the past

262
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,310
we were starting

263
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,780
for Intel so they decided to do

264
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,900
something like Search tab

265
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:08,240
the cream stuff so you're using your own

266
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,619
now this is a little bit there probably

267
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,908
might think I'd ever make

268
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,840
they are left to cure the LinkedIn

profiles talking as I went to DC you so

270
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,640
I kind of I kind of assumed

271
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,870
ucg assumptions make an assay to you

272

there are these prints

you know it's nothing

277
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,960
I know but that's not picking a flower

278
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,060
it's not extending to explode

279
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,910
yeah

280
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:40,340
oh just with the

281
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,130
yeah

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,980
going to ask people please we can't have

293
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,510
anybody in the stairwells so if there's

294
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,270
fair seats to the inside of you please

295
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,310
move in so that we get as many people in

296
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,940
the room as possible if you can do that

297
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,180
before he starts that will be great come

298
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,310
choose one particularly I see five seats

299
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,630
in the middle and they're set that would

300
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,310
be really nice if you could block those

301
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,460
up

302
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,919
so excuse me

303
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,340
you've got me thank you

304
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,739
thank you very much next up breaking a

305
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:48,499
tcp/ip switch me put you up
