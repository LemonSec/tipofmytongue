1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,200
problems with the technical stuff not

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,900
really we kind of got that sauce we can

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,029
build pretty much anything so a game

4
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,380
we're done half a million lines and

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,390
actually quite simple what you shoot be

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,270
easy for us but it's not so disciplines

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,880
design art no right encoding there are

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
others but I'm sort of moved for a very

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,760
high low here the main thing to look at

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,309
is is it polished every time look at the

11
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,410
game there's something that jars is

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,030
something that you can do to improve it

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,040
so on the design is it UNIX and do you

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,420
know this I'm sure everyone's seen

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,089
direct part by now odd hub in genetic

16
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,460
park you've got this fantastic world

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,500
they've managed to recreate dinosaur

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,650
from their DNA moving around every

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:19,810
single out if we find that happens you

20
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:30,729
have to fix your bone it's just right

21
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,219
it's like not tasty not too hard my

22
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,960
general rule this is always the third

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,479
lower game should be so easy even I can

24
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,729
win it yeah I guess I understand this I

25
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,200
like buying this then you've got a

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,979
second level make a little bit harder

27
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,450
lots of design questions put the hangman

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,280
up there as a very interesting face of

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,369
design how many lines should there be in

30
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,920
aimed hangman how many wives do you get

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,299
or how many two things you before it

32
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:05,049
ends number hangman you just gets

33
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,780
letters to try and count the word the

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,310
most commonly used letters of ink

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,600
language for English words is ETA o n

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,120
IRS in that order

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
will return letters if I just went

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,370
through each of those letters in turn

39
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,709
after templum I have got a TSN of most

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,640
common words spelt having 10 more

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,110
hangman is not a good game design

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,319
feature what can I do to improve that 9

43
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,720
you say we'll know valves for first

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,620
three turns

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,569
how do you improve what can you change

46
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,099
to make that game worth playing art

47
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,280
stuff no such thing your image is not

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,940
your collision later you should be very

49
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,110
generous with you let the play again

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:56,099
away with and you should the player -

51
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,220
yes I just miss it if they technically

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:26,329
hit it sometimes it's too too accurate I

53
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,139
type in literation as I could find the

54
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,419
less interface you can have in your game

55
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,319
the better does not have a HUD but every

56
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,870
game seems to want one if you can move

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,879
it by putting into the game itself

58
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
making it something in search that's

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,370
more natural this years ago is you know

60
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,079
you'd have health but actually there's a

61
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,150
picture of the mean guy with blood

62
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,459
coming out and more blood there was the

63
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,650
less health you had it was a very nice

64
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,230
way of representing a value in game

65
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,349
which wasn't the heart if you're playing

66
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,989
a game person you're shooting everything

67
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,760
in sight if you do not have the time to

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,910
school or look at weed the number pause

69
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,910
it and walk out I'm ugly damage can I go

70
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,859
to this fire fight it's worth it you

71
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,780
just want to be able to look at Kingo

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,820
yep I see that the health bars right

73
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,410
down I can see lots of blood on the

74
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,440
characters he's going to be dangerous so

75
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,389
if possible needed to face into the game

76
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,780
self

77
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,610
so you can see them on the gun for

78
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,310
example if you can't move it somewhere

79
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,020
where it's as intrusive this is my

80
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,130
favorite things but it's not actually

81
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,420
real Newton Foley is partly named Isaac

82
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,880
Newton every action there is an equal

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,310
and opposite reaction and for a guy

84
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,570
called for me back in 1923 30s in

85
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,220
Hollywood came up the idea that

86
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,040
everything you see on film has to have

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,180
sound now even those in the cheap seats

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,169
come here my footsteps

89
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,620
my feet would be making footstep sounds

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,180
there's another noise that means you

91
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,180
can't but if you see a film you accept

92
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,890
as a human to hear the noise even though

93
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,680
it's magical so you've got to have those

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,570
sound effects in there it just feels

95
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,490
natural you're used to it because

96
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,300
Hollywood is what you happen this way if

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,950
you think about how many sound there are

98
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,770
you might surprise take my example of

99
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,810
the first-person shooter again how many

100
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,810
sounds are there for a gun well there's

101
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,740
just a gun sound that's it but there's

102
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,930
also the reload sound there may be a

103
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,280
separate sound for the safety catch

104
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,710
cocking of the gun you might have

105
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,290
additional sounds for the bullet as it

106
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,940
hits the wall it'll be a rich a sound

107
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,520
every different type of Superior in your

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,950
world has a different ricochet sound you

109
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,390
might have a bullet casing stopping into

110
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,190
the floor again every different type of

111
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,810
for surface needs are different types

112
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,310
ound

113
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,020
this is seven types of sound effect for

114
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,340
one gun for guns you're looking at 20 or

115
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,669
30 cent effects every time they all just

116
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:15,880
add one little sound to make better in

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,350
creating an onset of sounds that you

118
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,080
need any other gun polish begats punch

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,270
every time you add something because it

120
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,400
makes it good you realize you've got to

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,130
then make everything else just as good

122
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,180
[Music]

123
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,139
probably enough we don't pay enough

124
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,449
attention to icing its kind of thing we

125
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,169
should everyone sings the word processor

126
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,850
on their pewter and as a cog once

127
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,820
everyone thinks they're writer it's not

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,449
that easy

129
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,840
getting good dialogue is hard people

130
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,780
shootings have a backstory even if it's

131
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,840
like demon quake it's something simple

132
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,310
marine you have to go and shoot stuff

133
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,800
that is enough of a backstory to go okay

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,370
I get it

135
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,130
we can still create that story so we

136
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,229
have reason there are you running toward

137
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,490
something are you running away from

138
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,800
something even those two different

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,740
simple ideas actually changes way you as

140
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,110
a player think about that game how your

141
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,229
interact with it creates a phenomenal

142
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,039
picture if you'll send the able don't

143
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,080
some switch it to touch lay button

144
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,810
switch the terminology to a missile

145
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,340
halfway available maimings as well only

146
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,659
three things hard do you know cache

147
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,479
invalidation and naming things one else

148
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,409
so keep the same names everywhere and

149
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,810
try and use context an emotional

150
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,900
language at all possible the poet game

151
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,210
example is academic and you have the

152
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,050
health in this game maybe how about

153
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,630
having health mangez where it's made as

154
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,990
rabid infested like that really point

155
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,330
out that you are a pirate our life of a

156
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,060
part is not nice so create those words

157
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,289
which really matched into that

158
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,900
environment and with pirate thing it's

159
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,220
very easy because you can say well even

160
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,039
100 percent health level is cool rabid

161
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,080
which shows the life as a pirate in

162
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,030
never nice even you at maximum health

163
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,809
you're still a bit sure be related if

164
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,360
you're doing games on Indonesia

165
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
crossover between English and American

166
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,370
then words like leads are kind of the

167
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,260
same thing but if you're you know

168
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,940
if the game is sitting America you have

169
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,920
to use American words it might seem

170
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,720
obvious it's the obvious things that you

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,670
miss I'm gonna translate one of my game

172
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,980
from English into American once it was

173
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,550
quite surreal the technical side of

174
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,960
missing handle translations have a

175
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,060
separate file to again use the developer

176
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,620
don't have to go through the NASA

177
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,690
missions when someone updates the text

178
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,370
it might seem like the easy bit at the

179
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,900
end I'll just write the instructions

180
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,200
later or like the website copy or it's

181
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
still a lot of work needs doing to write

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,130
all of that stuff make sure you test

183
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,640
everything

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,610
the length is a really fun example there

185
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,380
was a big way but way back where you

186
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,090
could go into a store and you could buy

187
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,780
- one Bullis this actually meant you're

188
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,700
given money because the computer just

189
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,160
says number portent applied by cost and

190
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,470
add this on it's a really nice way of

191
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,540
getting through the game you've gotta

192
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,010
check this stuff everyone knows that but

193
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,260
it's unfortunate because it must testing

194
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,010
new york word sometimes so i'm going to

195
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,780
a space bouncer so this is a simple game

196
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,960
it's just a few more five thing i play

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,680
through it we play for it and see how

198
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,440
many bits that you can spot that Wi-Fi

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,920
if not this

200
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:23,200
okay loading and I'm aware with the fade

201
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,480
is slow its I perhaps don't think you

202
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,750
can't hear here actually is there's a 3d

203
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,440
called motif it's just to say you know

204
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,110
it's a title screen there is an identity

205
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,930
associated with it again it's no big

206
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,460
support in but it's something you should

207
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,810
always remember to put on the title the

208
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,190
in the area of space are slightly

209
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,750
different to the known form last it's

210
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,420
giving an identity doesn't take a lot to

211
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,520
do but again it's a nother thing little

212
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,890
thing here just takes one hour to write

213
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,770
to put in as a hundred things that you

214
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,690
need to do that already a hundred hours

215
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:15,640
so he's he's going down this shirt if I

216
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,060
press the button he'll jump across does

217
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,490
so he's collecting leaves my lithium

218
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,260
crystals here which helped power

219
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,270
spaceship so that you can escape from

220
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:36,420
the planet to do get to the bottom

221
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,459
here we go

222
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,120
success level which is slightly faster

223
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
so what's actually going on in that game

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,330
most of the extra bits up in there give

225
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,920
yourself a point everyone you spot it's

226
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:04,130
a stylized or something like that has

227
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,680
obstacles faster so every single when

228
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,390
you go into a new level something

229
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,370
changes there's a little bit extra bring

230
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,850
on some ice officials in there this guy

231
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,400
is a gradient the moon attack did anyone

232
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,700
spot the moon on the game nope the

233
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,640
moon's up left and they do is I actually

234
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,130
look at the time and date from the

235
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,200
Pewter and I put the moon in the

236
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,360
astronomical position which is to say if

237
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
it's a full moon out that me on the

238
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,290
screen will be and if it's a quiz in

239
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,750
your life that will be present you say

240
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,870
they spotted that I enjoy doing and when

241
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,600
the planes will see that you've done

242
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,970
that they suddenly are they paid

243
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,740
attention they care about this game

244
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,110
enough to waste time I don't think what

245
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,170
seems so useless but actually you some

246
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,790
look at ya waiting that gave much as I

247
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,640
left playing and there's animations on

248
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,200
everything the screen effects it's a

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,070
pulsating thing so I'm going to open to

250
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,740
questions the book I've written long

251
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,170
beams but I get soul in world tease it's

252
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,850
not worth you buying them just buy me a

253
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,220
beer and I do everything that's in them

254
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,020
and anyone else good questions I have a

255
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,250
couple of copies here which I can throw

256
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,430
out so that's me I'll update my school

257
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,160
come now so there we go

258
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:14,770
6:10 so questions oh because it's our

259
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:22,990
moon and it's like the planet that is

260
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,780
incorrect but I think people are gonna

261
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,190
be more interested on the fact that it

262
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,530
is absolutely correct then they're gonna

263
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,990
start querying that you know nygma what

264
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,430
I said earlier about making sure the

265
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,209
oldest cohesive

266
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,540
so is it better to have a simple game

267
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,070
but it's nicely posting the answer is

268
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,850
yes you know if you're going for a job

269
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,870
you're gonna do this stuff

270
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,550
remotely having one thing that really

271
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,040
nicely polish is better than having 200

272
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,020
things that were half done maybe a

273
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,300
broken ear and now just get one thing

274
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,850
it's so she to start something it's so

275
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,890
little to finish if you can fill it with

276
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,630
all the polishing you get a lot more

277
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,880
awesome credit and everything else by

278
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:28,510
doing that definitely the way so first

279
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,470
spend your time watching the intro

280
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:53,079
screen so the question is if you polish

281
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,909
the title screen everything else did not

282
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,209
raise the expectations yes it does as it

283
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,479
should you should set player up to

284
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,479
really want to get into this game

285
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:07,689
there's a tea show in England mastermind

286
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:10,539
which is very simple quiz show you get

287
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,669
asked questions on especially subject

288
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,579
and then on general knowledge

289
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,609
the show starts with deep booming music

290
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,589
the studio is black or you see as a

291
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:21,639
chair in the middle

292
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,039
it's like interrogation that sets up

293
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,449
your expectation for the rest of the

294
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,099
show which is firing questions at you

295
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,409
one after another it's good to up those

296
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:35,309
expectation it really draws you in the

297
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,690
[Music]

298
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:55,559
question is with early lease games

299
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,149
better if they waited and actually

300
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,369
finished release to finish distortion

301
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,750
and yes they really should unfortunately

302
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,240
commercials such as they are require you

303
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,490
to get something out because the game

304
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,809
that has been most will make more money

305
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,480
than gates it's on someone's hard life

306
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,439
so there is that commercial that's often

307
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,059
above the integrity of the game

308
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,509
developers broken they knew it shouldn't

309
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,949
have been shipped but it wasn't no

310
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,740
decision make some management somewhere

311
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,049
that said no we have to release this or

312
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,629
there's no company there are so much in

313
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,519
so many game companies where if you

314
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,200
didn't get the

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,110
now that Italy would be no come left but

316
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,889
the margins were that smooth this

317
00:17:43,889 --> 00:18:03,029
question meaning even if it's just beat

318
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:09,389
so so question is this goes against the

319
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,340
open source mentor who's early release

320
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,799
often unfortunately it does and this is

321
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,299
one of those dichotomies between

322
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,309
outsource and games you don't want to

323
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,010
release early you do want to be able to

324
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,370
say this is this is finished again then

325
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,450
what the other commercial reasons

326
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,820
weren't brought to ship it out but if

327
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,070
you are able to just say no it's it's

328
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,110
you know you will get some people go oh

329
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,000
I kind of like this I'm getting into it

330
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,380
now I'm gonna start helping on this

331
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,080
project a lot the time ago looks awful

332
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,519
what I want to spend time on this but it

333
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,760
looks awful or it plays badly it's very

334
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,799
difficult within the same kind of

335
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,169
environment with gained for you to look

336
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,519
past that something's a bit shot

337
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,310
people start a game with w1 because it

338
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,690
will always start with one it's very

339
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,370
difficult to have an idea with someone

340
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,130
might be great to do a game you're

341
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,900
falling down a mineshaft you then talk

342
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,430
with some about that they go yeah this

343
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,190
how about that and from that point it

344
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,940
starts growing

345
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,190
most people have to be multiple

346
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,380
disciplined in name arena because we

347
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,330
would get it from that idea your head to

348
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,950
something you can tell someone what

349
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,200
about you have to at least do either a

350
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,000
bit of coding or a little bit of artwork

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,370
it's not great it says and she's my idea

352
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,740
and then print it that way you can you

353
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,600
know you always start one then maybe two

354
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,970
generally NR on a coach side and you

355
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,640
work on the design bits together and it

356
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
can just go up to as many people as you

357
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,690
could possibly fit in there was

358
00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:12,700
something over this side yes so if you

359
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,110
make a question if you make the game

360
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,270
easier game at that point I do kind of

361
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,690
agree with it is the player doesn't know

362
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,140
that the game gonna be that easy and

363
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,400
when you start the game you will

364
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,080
essentially give him a training level

365
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,760
you need to get them used to the

366
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,250
controls they need to learn how to jump

367
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,260
then they need to learn how to run and

368
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,000
jump at the same time

369
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,700
introducing these things progressive him

370
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,740
after the other allows them to

371
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,990
experience the controls get used to it

372
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,220
so when it really does matter

373
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,630
and they're going to die if they don't

374
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,190
jump at the right point they don't feel

375
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,190
cheated if they do die it's like well

376
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,900
I've had enough chances of this

377
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,580
I've got through level one I've done all

378
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,740
my lumps before it's in their fault from

379
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,180
what I learnt the control system

380
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,870
okay

381
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,779
