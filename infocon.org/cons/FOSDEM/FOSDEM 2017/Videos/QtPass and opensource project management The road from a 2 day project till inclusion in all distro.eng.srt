1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,180
okay so next on the young are so widely

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,900
known as the jinx from Amsterdam

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,750
hackerspace we'll talk about QT paths

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,500
and the project which started as a short

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,840
two-day project and go into something

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:30,140
very exciting indeed thank you allowed

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,238
to see how this remote work probably

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,149
doesn't well spacebar works

9
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:38,570
my name is Lani I'm Brower I'm developer

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,890
and hacker I work at a company called

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,130
Bob protocol and I found that our

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,620
co-founded one Amsterdam hacker

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,540
collective called I hack and I started

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,960
cutie Pass which currently is at version

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,640
1.1 0.6 and we're working on a 1.2

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,390
release but QT pass is pretty

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,490
interesting compared to pass bolt we

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,400
started around the same time we have one

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,190
tenth of the developers or contributors

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,330
one tenth of the commits of pause bolt

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,100
but yeah that's pretty understandable

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,020
since it's in C++ instead of PHP but

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,430
let's start at the beginning I was

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,710
working at a full-service company that

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,049
had lots of clients different clients

26
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,799
different projects and many secrets /

27
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,220
projects to share and to use internally

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,110
which was a big problem because how do

29
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,240
you keep those things well in their case

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,310
a big Samba share with / projects a lot

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,409
of files a lot of folders and a

32
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,000
passwords dot txt file that's not a way

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,710
to do it and especially if you have

34
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,200
external people working and have

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,720
customers coming to your office

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,210
connecting to the Wi-Fi it was a public

37
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,258
share so yeah we needed something else

38
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,120
we needed a way to store passwords

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,620
securely to share with coworkers with

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,340
external people prefer

41
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,319
the open standards preferably

42
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,980
open-source and this to be easy to use

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,050
so we got someone working on a project

44
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,330
to find that into in our company and he

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,010
found it imposters UNIX password manager

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,230
which is found that password store the

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,500
dark it's a collection of bash scripts

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,060
basically it uses open GDG it uses get

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,060
optionally it uses tree to display a

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,519
list of passwords and it uses PWM for

51
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,720
password generation optionally this is

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,630
what it looks like or might look like if

53
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,829
you have some tests going on it was

54
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,730
really nice the developers all loved it

55
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,220
instantly it's very easy to use it's

56
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,049
automatable you can just do tap

57
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:13,370
completion on the tree structure it

58
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,819
directly feels right you can also use

59
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,650
token-based authentication with the GPG

60
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,160
so you be key or something which you can

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,040
then take from a person when he leaves

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,639
the company so that's an added layer of

63
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,010
safety in there but then we ran into a

64
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,250
problem management managers really don't

65
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,630
like the command line and for no good

66
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,079
reason

67
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,709
not all managers of course but with no

68
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,420
good reason so yeah we had to find the

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,519
solution to get management team on board

70
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,630
and that's why I thought well I know

71
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,040
some QT let's whip up a simple QT GUI

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,090
application tree view place for showing

73
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,639
the contents of the password file update

74
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,989
button to do a get pool and well that's

75
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,120
very doable so yeah I wrote that

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,919
proof-of-concept in two nights waiting

77
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,920
for night buses in Amsterdam

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,680
laptop keeping me warm was pretty nice

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,589
and it just used his puffs in the

80
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,480
backend and get it was a simple wrapper

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,830
written in cute it was read only I put

82
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,220
it on github and did a small hackathon

83
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,560
with a couple of friends to add

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,870
translations and then I send a mail to

85
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,640
the password stored with org mailing

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,250
list on August 1st 2014 with node to

87
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,290
notify them yes well I've written this

88
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,410
simple read-only GUI thing have a look

89
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,940
at it if you find it interesting and

90
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,330
well that was it's a bit oh yeah I added

91
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,610
native mode so you don't need pass for

92
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,650
example in Windows you can't run best

93
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,320
scripts properly but you can use gate

94
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,910
and GPG and so I added a native mode I

95
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,880
put it on github which by then didn't

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,390
look as busy as now but I thought well

97
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,880
that's that's about it

98
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,840
just made a nice thing that's it but

99
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,630
then all of a sudden Easter 2015 I get a

100
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,510
lot of pull requests from Robert the

101
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,640
finger will later Matt's in Amsterdam

102
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,470
for a beer and he added adding an

103
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,900
editing of passwords in those pull

104
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,030
requests he added basic user management

105
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,750
because passwords store our pass in the

106
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,750
file tree you can add a dot GPG ID file

107
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,630
in which you list the people for whom it

108
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,540
should be encrypted to and that is

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,320
pretty obtuse it's just a dot file in a

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,450
dot folder and it has only the hashes or

111
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,580
emails of the peoples GPG IDs so it's

112
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,220
bit obtuse you've made very basic user

113
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,100
management to make it simple and edit

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
fixes for the windows a built that it

115
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,620
would actually build on Windows this is

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,169
what the user management look like after

117
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,050
I started hacking on it a bit added the

118
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,380
search feature and color coding system

119
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,570
to see which keys are usable and I

120
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,419
really got enthusiastic again about

121
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,340
developing on it because yeah some other

122
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,050
people

123
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,360
just joining in and started coding so we

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,139
added many many extra options this is

125
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,500
from version 1.0 and then in August 2015

126
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,449
August 1st exactly a year later I

127
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,560
decided yeah let's have a release party

128
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,750
because why not everybody should do that

129
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,759
if you have an open source project and

130
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,099
you don't have 1.0 released yet just

131
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,960
pick an arbitrary date pick an arbitrary

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,830
go have a release party

133
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:05,930
so in Amsterdam we did this in Amsterdam

134
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,599
and a cafe batavia 2019-20 which is

135
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,129
straight across from central stations

136
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,620
did a little translation hackathon I

137
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,690
told everybody I'd buy him a beer if

138
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,830
they would translate it to their

139
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,379
language so he got Hungarian simplified

140
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,789
Chinese we also we also did a soldering

141
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,949
workshop it was a very nice festive day

142
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,169
and we had a lot of beers of course so

143
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,770
the qt+ like this which was a lot more

144
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,960
interesting we added different profiles

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,199
so you can use different password stores

146
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,440
on your system a private one a company

147
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
one whatever and we added something else

148
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,469
which you might have seen here which is

149
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,039
the splash screen which has very clearly

150
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,289
stating please report any issues you

151
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,849
might have with this software and that

152
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,669
really helps because every time you

153
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,500
started you get this notification and if

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,449
you think something is broken something

155
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,940
sucks it takes away all the boundaries

156
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,500
for someone to just click the issues

157
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,539
link go to the github and add a new

158
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,599
issue to the tree so five days later

159
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,509
August 5th I got a message I'm waiting

160
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,460
for the ferry in Amsterdam I get a

161
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,400
message I looked into it and I would

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,500
like to hide the contents we only had a

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,289
height password feature at that point so

164
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm looking at it and yeah that's

165
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,029
interesting

166
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,969
someone who has dumb C++ in the past

167
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,949
would like to give it a shot so I'm

168
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,630
standing there waiting for my ferry to

169
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,849
come step on the ferry and write a very

170
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,659
simple summary of where to look what to

171
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,220
add what to do

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,490
and the next day I got a pull request

173
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,980
who hit the feature I mean that's yeah

174
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,830
that makes you an theistic about doing

175
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,950
more and more adding more stuff so then

176
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,840
I thought what else would be nice

177
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,230
password store our path uses a preferred

178
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,650
system of naming fields which is just

179
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,780
colon separated very simple it's also

180
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,900
used by the Firefox plugin I think for

181
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,880
login name and password and that kind of

182
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,590
well password is always the first line

183
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,010
so I'm for login URL that kind of stuff

184
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,430
so I added that feature which was pretty

185
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,970
fun nice but adding all those features

186
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,840
has a downside it gets clunky and

187
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,530
cluttery

188
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,680
so I thought I need to do something with

189
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,970
that and looked into stuff so I set up

190
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,630
Travis to do Linux and Windows and OS X

191
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,410
built and also pushing to Coverity which

192
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,560
is a static code analysis sites for open

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,660
source projects is free to use up to a

194
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,390
certain amount of times a day I can't

195
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,270
exactly remember but static code

196
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,190
analysis really helps it finds bugs

197
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,530
before they become bugs and initialize

198
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,190
variables that kind of stuff and it well

199
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,530
if you just run it it's always there you

200
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,680
don't have to think about it so the

201
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,740
Travis file if if anybody hasn't done

202
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,990
travellish yet and is doing something

203
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,970
with c c++ or any other language

204
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,520
actually please set it up it's very

205
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,370
simple it's a service that's free for

206
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,980
open source projects etc and this is a

207
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,290
bit simplified I took out some of the

208
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,800
crap but it just runs the cutes make and

209
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,190
it notifies unsuccess only if there is a

210
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,480
change or on failure always so whenever

211
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,820
there's something that doesn't compile

212
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,940
from either Linux or OSX in either GCC

213
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,490
or clang so for build I get a

214
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,000
notification on both IRC and mill but

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,020
yeah then windows cute is very nice in

216
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,550
that it's a completely cross-platform

217
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,279
I wanted to add next to the OS X builds

218
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,050
which were now being done by Travis by

219
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,160
the way I wanted to do Windows builds so

220
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,290
how do I do that I download a VM from

221
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,420
modern both ie because I don't own any

222
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,380
Windows computers I set up cute creator

223
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,029
the ISS install creator studio etc have

224
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,329
to do that every month because the VM

225
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,990
license expires it's really obnoxious

226
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,640
luckily I found that there's also up

227
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
there which is exactly the same as

228
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,990
Travis only for Windows

229
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,200
unfortunately the syntax is a bit more

230
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,550
clunky because windows but actually

231
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,029
every build I get an installer is made

232
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:42,510
with the is CC the Installer builder and

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,720
whenever I do a tagged release it's

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,820
automatically uploaded to get up so I

235
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,100
don't have to touch Windows VMs anymore

236
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,250
happy happy if you need any help with

237
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,079
this kind of set up with your own

238
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,589
project feel free to contact me no

239
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,959
worries there so yeah we got more and

240
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,779
more people contributing doing a lot of

241
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,950
you exchanges making it nicer and

242
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,870
starting to use iconography we had a

243
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,360
long discussion on github issue queue

244
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,170
about this freedesktop.org has a nice

245
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,029
system of setting up icons for stuff

246
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,760
which is standardized and works on

247
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,279
everything unfortunately not on Mac OS

248
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,959
or Windows so I changed two SPG's for

249
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,890
that but yeah adding a lot of new

250
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,829
features for example double click to

251
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,449
edit that kind of stuff and we thought

252
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,260
yeah time for another release 1.1 which

253
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,750
looks on a dark KDE theme looks like

254
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,600
this oh no looks like this so it takes

255
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,380
on your standard preferred setup of look

256
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,140
and feel really nice currently we're

257
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,079
working on a new release new big release

258
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,260
1.2 release Oh what did I push

259
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,050
working on a 1.2 release we have

260
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,930
currently five active contributors who

261
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,590
are doing week near weekly commits and

262
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,360
and who requests

263
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,160
we're doing a lot of refactoring and

264
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,230
finally doing unit tests although I have

265
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,510
to admit I only added one unit test

266
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,250
which is for a static helper function

267
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,420
function to always add a slash to a off

268
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,570
but there is now a possibility to run

269
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,330
unit tests which are also run by Travis

270
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,720
etc and again we're doing a lot of UI

271
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,570
and UX changes so this is what the

272
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,780
current master version of QT path looks

273
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,130
like we added copying buttons for the

274
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,450
different fields and a lot more stuff

275
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,780
also you can now do ASCII art hence the

276
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,240
indentation in your password files

277
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,330
always nice we're thinking about adding

278
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,110
a possibility of doing binary

279
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,590
attachments but not not standardized and

280
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,070
how yet because it's running on GPG

281
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,230
behind the scenes that shouldn't be a

282
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,800
problem

283
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,640
GPG can do binary attachments no problem

284
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,210
that was about it

285
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,530
any questions

286
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:42,410
somewhat as a question no question we

287
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:56,510
have a question yeah hello

288
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,320
I see that you are saving passwords but

289
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,870
only one password can you save or is it

290
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,170
plan to have multiple field for example

291
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,430
I comments what pass what is it or maybe

292
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,970
look in the password another thing the

293
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,000
passwords currently have that option

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,980
that's the field down below where it

295
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,870
currently says testing indentation and

296
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,870
more indentation in this example that's

297
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,640
a completely free form field where it

298
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,090
can add whatever comments you'd like

299
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,340
also you can in the configuration set

300
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,950
the fields you would like for example in

301
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,880
this case password login URL test but

302
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,330
you can also click a button that allows

303
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,240
any colon separated key value pair to be

304
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,410
a field like that with the copy button

305
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,020
okay it helps yes now can you will you

306
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,600
have it some kind of template for

307
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,470
example you I want to add I don't know

308
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,440
what could it a credit card number it

309
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,730
has a fixed fields yeah I haven't

310
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,100
thought about that but that sounds like

311
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,940
like an interesting feature yeah that

312
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,420
should be do

313
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,180
one thing else I forgot in 1.2 upcoming

314
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,230
1.2 release

315
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,910
there's also dragging and dropping of

316
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,880
files and folders and because you can

317
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,540
set for every folder to whom it should

318
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,010
be encrypted for whom it should be

319
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,470
decrypted

320
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,180
everything gets re encrypted as soon as

321
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,280
you do a drag and drop operation which

322
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,550
might pop up your GPG phosphorous or

323
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,310
something which is a bit interesting

324
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,030
having passwords doesn't require any

325
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,230
keys because GPG encrypting to someone

326
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,920
to a public key is it's a non privileged

327
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,220
operation but decrypting you get asked

328
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,830
for your GPG decryption key unless you

329
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,300
have no password boss phrase on your GPG

330
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,140
and we have a last question at the end

331
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,800
hello I I was asking if there is

332
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,459
something - is the creation of GPG keys

333
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,490
for people that don't for managers and

334
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:27,199
people that not tippity QT pastors have

335
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,510
a nice key generator if you start it up

336
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,310
and you don't have a private key in your

337
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,740
user or there's no private key available

338
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,940
to GPG you get presented with a to field

339
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,880
option for name and email address and a

340
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,260
checkbox to enable complete editing of

341
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,630
the GPG key generation file but well we

342
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,000
made it a simple two step process for

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
example take a clean Windows machine

344
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,850
install QT pause first thing it pops up

345
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,960
is a link to the wind GPG GPG for win

346
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,930
something like that for you to download

347
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,570
GPG soon as you've done that you get

348
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,880
presented with a two field option name

349
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,790
and email and your key is generated you

350
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,280
can get going and if you set up Outlook

351
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,360
or for example Mac OS mail with GG tools

352
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,060
you automatically get get the added

353
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,580
benefit of sending encrypted emails or

354
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,970
we signed and that's in our company when

355
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,920
we started with cutie paws that was a

356
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,840
nice added bonus because all of a sudden

357
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,130
all the managers started sending

358
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,420
encrypted emails does that help

359
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,330
does that answer your question yes thank

360
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,210
you thank you and thanks for it that's

361
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,960
uploading
