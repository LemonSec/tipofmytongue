ashika and I hope I don't disappoint you

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,020
but my profession is not computer

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,210
science I study psychology and I will

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,900
talk about tabla Kia the app for

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,699
children is dyslexia from the

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,689
perspective of my position I'm some kind

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,180
of coordinator of this project from the

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,089
very beginning and yeah I will tell you

11
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,199
more about it but I firstly should tell

12
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:45,350
that we develop table science is ethnic

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,879
which is actually Association nonprofit

14
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,799
Association which takes care I am sorry

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,930
for my language but I don't understand

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,570
that so much but takes care of the seeds

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,069
see that domain registry so I work in

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,010
the in the Department of research and

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,000
development which salt labs and we do a

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,170
lot of open source development there and

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,049
you may know for example to omnia which

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,189
is our new router which is open source

23
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,179
base and we also develop not ens and

24
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,630
Bert

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,789
but I will tell you about ablixa which

26
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:37,210
is app for Android and iOS and it is

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,189
cognitive training for children with

28
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,799
dyslexia and we are based but we are

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,670
specialized on all our children because

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,399
the reason why we realized that we want

31
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,979
to develop this game was because there

32
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,020
was a lot of teachers and psychologists

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,840
who told us well it's fine we can do a

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,299
lot of education with the children but

35
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,459
they are not motivated and especially

36
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,189
all the children are motivated to do

37
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,780
anything for them and to to being better

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,758
so we are realized we want to make a

39
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,590
game to for them to to have fun and at

40
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,590
the same time to force them a bit to do

41
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,799
something for them so that is now

42
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,430
available in Czech Slovak and German

43
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,129
language we started with the Czech

44
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,910
version but then our colleague from

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,220
Slovak told us that they would like to

46
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,709
have to death as well and then we

47
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,299
realised that could be fun to do with it

48
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,590
also in German and now table contents 8

49
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,769
games which are connected in detective

50
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:50,590
topic so there is young detective who is

51
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,970
trying to become better detective and

52
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,670
learn how to how to do that top likes

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,190
yeah it's already available for free on

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,790
on Android and iOS and it's used already

55
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,709
in many schools and counseling

56
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,340
facilities in Czech Republic and also in

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,829
in Slovakia and domain but we try to

58
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,139
convince children to use it although on

59
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,139
their own without being forced from

60
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,470
schools and other facilities

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,530
I would like to tell a bit about

62
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,330
dyslexia actually is because I'm not

63
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,300
sure if it's clear what I mean with when

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,570
I say bit less dyslexia so it's one of

65
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,790
the specific learning disabilities which

66
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,410
means that people who have dyslexia our

67
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,480
problems have problems with reading and

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,390
writing but the problems with reading

69
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,350
and writing our cost because of some

70
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,690
deficit in cognitive functions it means

71
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,550
that firstly those people have some

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,250
problems with attention or working

73
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,190
memory which caused the problems with

74
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,670
reading and writing and we also used to

75
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,660
say a lot that people dyslexia using a

76
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,760
lot of different strategies how to learn

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,730
so when they have problems with in some

78
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,298
part of this cognitive functions they

79
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,640
are trying to avoid that and in using

80
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,630
different learning strategies so Alexia

81
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,650
should help them to find the way how to

82
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,400
getting better and how to find the

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
things that work for them and where are

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,850
their weaknesses

85
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,890
we are not doing that alone and she's

86
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,380
ethnic we are cooperating with some

87
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,620
different universities especially

88
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,270
Charles University in Prague the

89
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,520
Department of Psychology where I study

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,530
and we we consult all the work we do on

91
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,850
the app with a blanket hor with

92
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,950
specialists on special educational

93
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,840
problems and who helps us to to make the

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,710
app really working and we also worked

95
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,780
with constant in the first offer

96
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,800
University in Nitra where some people

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,080
helped us with developing the Slav

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,830
aggression and also University Indiana

99
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,690
where we developed the German version

100
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,390
and now we are doing a bit of research

101
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,650
on Hamlet University of Technology

102
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,150
speaking about technology I would say

103
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,720
just a few words about about the

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,270
technological part of the app we firstly

105
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,730
roll up just for Androids

106
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,820
because it's used

107
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,000
like yeah I think in 80% of cases where

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,389
we want people to use tablets

109
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,430
they'd be use smartphones or tablets

110
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,789
with other wait so we decided to to do

111
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,639
that in and enjoin but then there was a

112
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,289
lot of people who told us that it would

113
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,650
like to use it also for iOS so we

114
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,270
decided for some cross-platform

115
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,940
development and because the app is

116
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,419
already written in China we decided to

117
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,490
use libgdx which allowed us to make the

118
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,770
app in for iOS and Android

119
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,530
at the same time and there's also option

120
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,229
to make it on desktop which we are going

121
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,470
to to train this year if it works and it

122
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,820
really works the same same way as on on

123
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,900
tablets and all the app with all the

124
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,139
content or sounds and pictures it's been

125
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,380
source under the license GPL and you can

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,400
find the project on github

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,530
we also do a lot of testing with the

128
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,510
apps because from the very beginning we

129
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,930
tried to to really use children with

130
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,440
dyslexia as the people who should tell

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,840
us if it works as it should and and if

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,850
they like it if they understand what

133
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,389
they should do but yeah every time with

134
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,639
some new game which we develop we

135
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,610
firstly try that on our own if we able

136
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,090
even to play that and if we think that

137
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,150
it's okay we are going to schools and we

138
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,010
are asking children what they think

139
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,370
about it and we also are trying to make

140
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,250
the game so difficult that the children

141
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,889
are really learning something new but at

142
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,310
the same time what's so difficult - yeah

143
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,220
help them to really have fun not just be

144
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,460
designed it and frustrated and now we

145
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,680
are also trying to focus more about the

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,470
effectivity of the app because it's it's

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,930
really interesting question if it really

148
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,300
helps if it really if we let people to

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,910
play home games if it helps them to be

150
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,190
better in reading and writing so we try

151
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,610
to make them pretty post-test design to

152
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,539
find out if if it's true but we honest

153
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,460
it's quite difficult because we need to

154
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,580
find a lot of children with dyslexia it

155
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,360
means I should have to diagnose and

156
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,700
crack them together and let them play

157
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,849
the game for some time so I don't know

158
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,169
like 6 or 7 weeks at least three times a

159
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,339
week but we are trying to cooperate that

160
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,490
with schools but we found out that two

161
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,860
are not going to school so much how it's

162
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,500
possible but I'm missing all the chance

163
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,100
of it it's really hard to catch them and

164
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,820
we are still working on the air so we

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,000
planned to make 10 games so there is two

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,070
two left which we want to develop this

167
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,339
year and we also try to focus on the

168
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,130
desktop version

169
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,649
and it was also a lot of questions about

170
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,399
our languages because the first question

171
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,860
you may be half is why is it not in

172
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,089
English but it's quite difficult because

173
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,750
as we wanted to make an app which would

174
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,970
work for Czech children we focused on on

175
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,709
tech language dyslexia is based on the

176
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,560
specific of each language so people with

177
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,589
dyslexia struggle with something L in

178
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,220
Czech and in English so it's not so easy

179
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,829
to make games to be so yet transform

180
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,230
able to to other languages I will show

181
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,970
you some slides for the game so you will

182
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,100
seem to be more about what I'm talking

183
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,389
enough and we also from the from the

184
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,850
data we have from the app we found out

185
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,639
that we already have some problems with

186
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,610
German version because in some parts of

187
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,009
the app where there is a lot of reading

188
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:11,290
texts the German version is much harder

189
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,709
for the tolerant than the Czech version

190
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,839
because there is a lot of like huge

191
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,839
German words which isn't so easy to read

192
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,930
so so that's what we are going to try to

193
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,220
fix here this is the first game we

194
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,070
who understands the German can read that

195
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,970
it's it says rather or in the case in

196
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,070
German it's it's quite complicated

197
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,280
because there is a lot of like gender

198
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,400
correctness and for example in Czech

199
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,100
language we don't have a word or woman

200
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,340
detective or women no detectives but not

201
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,280
a woman rubber yeah whatever but in

202
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,710
German we have to ride that all the time

203
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,640
both so that is the beginning of the

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,530
game start to be more complicated in

205
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,120
German language because they need to

206
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,610
read two words instead one at the

207
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,150
beginning and then you can see there is

208
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:22,670
robbery has some yellow whatever

209
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,130
something on him and and some some

210
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:33,560
bosses and the task is to read this this

211
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,460
information and then you will see some

212
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,040
people coming into a shop and you have

213
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,930
to find out who was the robber

214
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,350
so in this case it was the picker is not

215
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,020
belonging to the text before but it

216
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,300
would be quite easy because you can just

217
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,810
say ok this one has this but then there

218
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,570
are more complicated instructions for

219
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,750
example the robber a person who has the

220
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,080
same trousers a person who comes for him

221
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,930
so the people have to really focus more

222
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,650
on the on the content and use their

223
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,710
working memory this is another game

224
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,890
which is spatial orientation so in the

225
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,030
tasks to have to put the map together to

226
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,750
find out where the robbers are hidden

227
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,430
and there are different math and and

228
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,130
they each game has three different

229
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,270
levels of difficulty so this is the the

230
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,800
easiest one and then you have four to

231
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,330
four times four and five times five

232
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,700
Maps this game is on for logical

233
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,270
recognition and analyzes and you hear

234
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,550
some voices and you have to find out

235
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,160
which one is the right one so firstly

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,760
you see some some word and then you have

237
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
to find from these three options you can

238
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,770
see what the signs are which one was

239
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,310
right and in the more difficult version

240
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,780
there is some slider missing in the

241
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,270
middle of the word so it's even more

242
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,670
difficult to to find out and there was

243
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,030
also one of the games which was quite

244
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,340
complicated to make in German because

245
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,810
the German works some kind of different

246
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,170
in pronunciation pronouncing see aiding

247
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,080
words than the English then check and

248
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
even in English when we were thinking

249
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,740
about it it was yeah it seemed given

250
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,630
even worse this is a game for training

251
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,830
visual memory where the detective see

252
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,010
some some windows and at the same time

253
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,750
he sees watch where some some time

254
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,000
appears and they have to then

255
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,800
press the right in dough's and put at

256
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,520
the right time when it appeared this

257
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,140
game it's shooting range it's when we

258
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,390
started to to test it that with children

259
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,690
we asked them what are the game they

260
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,550
would like to have there and they all

261
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:28,260
told us okay we want to shoot someone so

262
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,410
we try to put them the shooting in the

263
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,010
game but not on the people so yeah they

264
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,990
don't like that much right so this game

265
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,070
is training of attending you can see the

266
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,900
flower there on a mmm right corner so

267
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,260
the flower is randomly changing and they

268
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,710
have to shoot the the right flowers on

269
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,420
the screen this one game is it's called

270
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,550
in the darkness but it's not really in

271
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,210
the dark but imagine that you are here

272
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,270
you are this small person and are trying

273
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,720
to go there to the safe and you have to

274
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,630
plan your way to the safe through this

275
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,630
labyrinth or building so you have these

276
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,480
kind of blocks to ask what you can do

277
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,450
you can walk one step or you can turn or

278
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,510
you can dump across the the dog or you

279
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,930
can open door so you plan that and if

280
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,900
you are finished then you can go and you

281
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,560
will see if you did that right then we

282
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,610
have a visual recognition so you can see

283
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,550
some symbols here and you can smell so

284
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,370
the same symbol stairs to the task and

285
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,260
this is the e level it's to just find

286
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,700
the the right symbol but in the more

287
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,280
complicated version the symbol are

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,890
reversed so they have to map late the

289
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,420
symbol and mine before and then there is

290
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,460
also a version where there is more

291
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,940
symbols on the same place that they have

292
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,740
to find it in the middle of them

293
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,890
and this is for now the last name which

294
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:25,150
is on the phonological memory so here at

295
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,840
the beginning some kind of sounds there

296
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,540
is for example three sounds and in the

297
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,780
beginning and they see this room they

298
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,600
have to find out what was the sounds and

299
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,750
in which order they they were so they

300
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,930
put them the subjects which made the

301
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,900
sound in this order here and there's

302
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,830
also some other parts of the app which

303
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,250
is this Hall of Fame where you can see

304
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,070
that when you are good and are really

305
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,610
getting better

306
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,780
you are also gaining some trophies and

307
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,980
special special prizes and here you can

308
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,079
also see there are some some badges

309
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,430
which show how good detective you are

310
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,720
there's also some part which is called

311
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,280
statistics which shows how are you doing

312
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,520
in the app and if you are getting better

313
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,710
or not or if there is something what you

314
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,120
should train more or something what you

315
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,230
shouldn't do it well and this is also a

316
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,150
part which called encyclopedia it's

317
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,640
slide is from a webpage because the app

318
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
is obvious not in in English but this is

319
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,180
how it looks like so you have here some

320
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,880
kind of things which are explained to

321
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,220
the to the children what that actually

322
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,600
means that they have some kind of

323
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,850
dyslexia or so because they are

324
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,250
sometimes really interested in that but

325
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,280
yeah we realized that there is like for

326
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,590
example there and sometimes even don't

327
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,500
know what that means we try to make that

328
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,870
easier for them to understand and there

329
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,620
is at the end some tip what they can do

330
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,690
to learn better and all the texts are

331
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,660
also with Swiss according so they can

332
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,060
hear that at the same time you read it

333
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,610
helps them to do understand it better

334
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,030
and that's it for me I thank you for our

335
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:52,270
attention yeah the question was such a

336
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,880
kind of people we are looking forward to

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,740
translate the app in on languages

338
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,780
yeah the translation is easy but it's

339
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,900
it's complicated in the meaning of

340
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,550
dyslexia so we need some kind of expert

341
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,950
as we did that in for example with the

342
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,290
term immersion we asked a person on the

343
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,480
University of Vienna who understands

344
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,250
dyslexia in German context and yeah so

345
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,680
that's basically what would we need that

346
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,980
the the biggest problem we have because

347
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,960
we have people who are programming that

348
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,590
and yeah then we of course need some

349
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,590
native speaker to record all the text

350
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,560
but that's also not such a big deal

351
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:48,820
and it doesn't work okay we ask the

352
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,790
people who are really working with AB

353
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,190
who are doing that to children on the

354
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,640
daily basis and they told us we think it

355
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,300
works

356
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,730
we saw some kind of evidence we see that

357
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,280
if they do this task then they are

358
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,040
getting better in this real-life task

359
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,400
[Music]

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,540
[Laughter]

361
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,840
I'm sorry that was a question so these

362
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,200
games are to help kids with senior gains

363
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,340
to diagnose it

364
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,690
the question was if we can use the and

365
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,600
also to diagnose dyslexia well we can't

366
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,530
it's it's quite completed but we can say

367
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,960
in which particular cognitive functions

368
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,480
are some deficits so we can say yeah

369
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
okay it spatial orientation it's a bit

370
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,890
problem but you are really good in

371
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,410
working memory I can say okay you are

372
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:04,860
dyslexic that that was four years yeah

373
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,060
the question was how long it took to be

374
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,210
here yeah

375
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm sorry I'm not sure if I understand

376
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:38,460
it we already started with that and the

377
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,480
question sorry the question was what are

378
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,900
how we are if we already did some kind

379
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,400
of effectiveness research or we thing we

380
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,970
started in the in last year we did some

381
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,420
kind of POD testing but the thing is

382
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,830
that it's even hard to tell what should

383
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,590
be the tests we use to find out if it

384
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,170
really will works so we have some kind

385
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,200
of cognitive tests but is that really

386
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,480
what we want to measure and then we have

387
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,630
some kind of reading and writing tests

388
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,670
but the problem is that for these older

389
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,850
children 11 to 15 there is for example

390
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,770
in Czech Republic that's not so much as

391
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,630
we can use and they already know the

392
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,450
tests because those are the tests they

393
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,930
were measured with to be diagnosed with

394
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,290
dyslexia so they the tests are all read

395
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,740
biased

396
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,870
it's not transferable yeah the question

397
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,080
was if we try to measure that against

398
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,500
the test results or school results it's

399
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,050
not where we can actually I don't think

400
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:14,320
it's good idea at all because usually

401
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,870
they are in normal schools because the

402
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,990
the the deficit is usually not so huge

403
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,450
to make them being in in some special

404
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,630
schools but there are in in in the

405
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,870
schools sometimes some classes where all

406
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,690
the children with just like Lea are be

407
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,850
from different classes but for this one

408
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,429
lesson where they are doing some kind of

409
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:39,220
reg ocation so they are doing this like

410
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,640
cognitive trainings and also some some

411
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,720
kind of like reading writing trainings -

412
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,600
yeah and there is also a lot of like

413
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,470
facilities are people with dyslexia are

414
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,450
attending some kind of free education

415
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,570
with without the Disco context so it's

416
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,100
in their free time let's say

417
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,150
as a kind of remedial teaching

418
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,900
yeah if you make the doctor

419
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,820
yeah we already

420
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,020
yeah we were already in contact with

421
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,100
some people from from Netherlands and

422
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,640
Belgium but it didn't work it's quite

423
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,710
complicated process to put that all

424
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,870
together and we are now focused on

425
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,870
finishing 10 games and then we can maybe

426
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:00,459
easily transfer these memories yeah

427
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:10,560
[Applause]
