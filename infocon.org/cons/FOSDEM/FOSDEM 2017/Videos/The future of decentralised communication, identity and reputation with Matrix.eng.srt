1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,359
hi

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,939
oh hello everybody good morning thank

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,400
you for curing or whatever it's to come

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,620
in here can everybody hear me

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,320
can everybody understand me okay I

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,329
apologize because there's a lot of stuff

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,680
to go through here and I've got twenty

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,090
minutes so it's going to be quite first

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,419
to grab your coffee and kind of hold on

10
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,369
for good luck first of all who knows

11
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,110
what matrix is already Wow that's

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,840
petrifying honestly okay well the good

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,370
news is that we can probably skip very

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,960
quickly through the first bit which is a

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,760
kind of generic hey everybody this is

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,910
what matrix is the matrix today is the

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,710
bunch of this talk is to compare where

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,020
we are today and crazy sci-fi for the

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,870
future is obviously matrix for a

20
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,730
non-profit open standard it's all about

21
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,220
defragmenting communication the idea is

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,110
that we build some kind of meta network

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,210
which goes and links together all of the

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,220
silos out there today whether they're

25
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,640
slack or whatsapp or IRC or whatever

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,890
sort of bubble of communication we have

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,809
today I mean link them all together live

28
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,060
a lowest-common-denominator

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,140
decentralized fabric that liberates

30
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,380
communication to be controlled by us so

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,179
in practice you have a whole bunch of

32
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,219
siloed bubbly things and it could be a

33
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,719
community on Gesser it could be a

34
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,780
community on slack and IRC XMPP skype

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,700
whatever could even be an application

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,799
like github which needs to be integrated

37
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,039
into this with some kinds of bots and

38
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,359
you're going slap matrix in the middle

39
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,749
as a whole bunch of servers where you

40
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,639
have conversation history that is

41
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,439
decentralized across all of the

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,779
different battles so suddenly they're no

43
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,850
longer trapped inside say slack

44
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,090
instead it kind of functions like a bit

45
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,029
like gates but for chats history or

46
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:47,499
communication conversation history

47
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,310
itself

48
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,770
so you have bridges that go through to

49
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,990
various different silos and then the

50
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,899
core network is a full mesh service

51
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,579
which store the conversation you can

52
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,529
have native matrix clients that connect

53
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,479
to that and that's basically matrix in a

54
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,289
picture point is that no single party

55
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,969
owns the conversations the thing

56
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,068
agressively decentralizes the

57
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,230
conversation so that if I'm talking to

58
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,700
somebody on a different matrix server

59
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,069
that conversation has to be replicated

60
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,959
over both so that if my server goes down

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,770
they

62
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,290
continue communicating and that's kind

63
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,000
of the main core unique thing about

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
matrix that it literally subversively

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,700
aggressively stops the ability for you

66
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,760
to form a wall garden or a silo and

67
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,590
obviously the conversations end up

68
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,360
they're replicated over all the

69
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,850
participants you can use it for group

70
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,950
chats you can use a for VoIP signalling

71
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,260
bridging any kind of silo and it's kind

72
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,750
of fun for IOT dater because it acts in

73
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,300
the end as a great big open JSON

74
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,160
database basically where you can publish

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,290
any old object out onto the web and

76
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,600
people can subscribe to it it gets

77
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,940
persisted and replicated around the

78
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,700
place and in some ways we like to think

79
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,440
of it a bit like an evolution of the web

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,330
itself kind of a step towards the

81
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,910
readwrite kind of dynamics to the web

82
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,950
the Tim berners-lee was originally kind

83
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,440
of aiming for so in the end in the

84
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,910
simplest case if I want to send you a

85
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,430
message I do an HTTP put them to my

86
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,470
server it fans that out to the other

87
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,570
servers and their new on your service

88
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,370
will do an HTTP GET to get the object

89
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,140
and it's as simple as that

90
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,720
it doesn't have to be HTTP but that's

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,980
the baseline kind of

92
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,490
lowest-common-denominator stupid simple

93
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,840
transport that we use because everybody

94
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,840
knows what HTTP is some people are

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,459
probably thinking why are you inventing

96
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,340
XMPP is anybody thinking that or can I

97
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,050
skip the next few slides okay we've got

98
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,930
one two three four five six seven eight

99
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,390
okay we've got about ten people saying

100
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,480
why are they reinventing XMPP our take

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,730
is that we're really not as in they are

102
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,680
very very very different things

103
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,870
I mean critically I'm probably the

104
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,070
single biggest difference is the

105
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,870
difference in philosophy in architecture

106
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,959
that in matrix you have one speck there

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
currently is a non point-to-point oh and

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,310
we're way over June or point 3.0 release

109
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,850
and if you implement that you get matrix

110
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,620
now bits a bits are optional so if

111
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540
you're implementing it on an IOT device

112
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,880
and obviously don't want to do video

113
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,380
calling or you might want to you don't

114
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,450
want typing notifications so there are

115
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,709
different bits of the spec which are

116
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,540
optional for different use cases but in

117
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,500
the end it is a single consistent spec

118
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,130
so that's probably the biggest

119
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,720
difference then are the architectural

120
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,490
level the primitives are also completely

121
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,620
different matrix is not message passing

122
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,420
I'm not checking an XML

123
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,750
to user and going and taking my

124
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,830
eventually consistent history of the

125
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,020
room and replicating it over to you it's

126
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,880
the difference between doing a get push

127
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,020
and sending an email if I makes any

128
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,970
sense also everything is great

129
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,520
conversation so you have rooms and you

130
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,960
have people in the rooms if there are

131
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,610
two people in the room then it's a kind

132
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,140
of direct conversation but that's very

133
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,950
much a subset of the general idea of

134
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,410
great conversations and also almost

135
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,170
end-to-end encryption is in there as a

136
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,700
first-class citizen in the whole

137
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,460
protocol obviously differences that we

138
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,550
using HTTP and Jason but it's not XMPP

139
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,010
with Jason as I said it's got very big

140
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,540
other differences and finally gets a big

141
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,000
sort of philosophical difference is that

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,210
we're not trying to be kind of the xkcd

143
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,070
fifteenth standard that it solves

144
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,530
everybody's problems instead we're going

145
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,070
and focusing on bridging together all of

146
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,290
the other silos so if you want to keep

147
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,300
using XMPP please do if you want to use

148
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,790
IRC like I do please do the only point

149
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,130
here is to just have a protocol really

150
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,020
optimized in some ways for bridging now

151
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,610
if you want to use it as natively that's

152
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,410
cool too

153
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,270
so actually architecture that kind of

154
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,650
already touched on a full measure of

155
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,800
servers clients connect to servers

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,960
application servers are a bit like

157
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,420
clients but on steroids it rips off the

158
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,180
IRC structure where you have an hour CED

159
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,790
and then you have IRC services like next

160
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,500
serve which basically our users but they

161
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,840
have superpowers same architecture here

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,360
their application services that allow

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,010
you to build arbitrary functionality and

164
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,450
bridge to other things and they they

165
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,070
kind of hang off a server like a big

166
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,080
client and then finally the interesting

167
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
one for this to look at last I'd be

168
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,530
wanting to do this talk for ages these

169
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,930
slightly suggestive looking identity

170
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,580
servers going and sitting in the corner

171
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,740
and they honestly are an embarrassment

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,330
and so identity servers I'll talk about

173
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,270
in a minute but basically they map

174
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,500
third-party identifiers like email

175
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,110
addresses and phone numbers and Facebook

176
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,680
IDs whatever into matrixes internal IDs

177
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
and at the moment these are logically

178
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,750
centralized and this

179
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,880
his matrix dog and that one's running on

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,100
vector dot I am but it's basically a

181
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,220
single database that maps identity the

182
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,600
one thing you need to know is that it's

183
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,090
only mapping identity it's not where

184
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,590
your accounts live it's not where your

185
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,790
passwords or anything live it's

186
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,460
literally just a naming service that

187
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,010
says hello this email address maps to

188
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,920
this personal matrix and this is one of

189
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,540
the big embarrassments of matrix and one

190
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,010
of the things in the future that we're

191
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,520
hoping to fix ecosystem as a whole main

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,830
deliverable is the spec we provide a

193
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,470
bunch of server implementations synapse

194
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,030
is the only one that you can really use

195
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,580
today it's Python and twisted hit naught

196
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,740
point 19 yesterday and it actually

197
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,300
doesn't suck anymore

198
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
I mean it's honestly it's taken as two

199
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,980
years to get to this point it started

200
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,170
off as a proof of concept that was very

201
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,740
inefficient very organically grown and

202
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,390
is then growing even more and the last

203
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,919
couple of six months we've kind of been

204
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,110
collapsing it back down to be a sensible

205
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,750
size and certainly as of not nineteen

206
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,520
that now uses an almost reasonable

207
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,970
amount of RAM and is almost efficient so

208
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,130
for instance on the matrix dot log

209
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,320
server we're taking in about ten

210
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
messages a second and pushing out about

211
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,800
two thousand messages a second because

212
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,840
the rooms are so big and that's taking

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,380
about 40 percent CPU fairly flat and

214
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,760
admittedly quite a lot of RAM there but

215
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,200
my personal ones now running it's about

216
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,729
three hundred and fifty megabytes of RAM

217
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,950
which you might think is Wow relative to

218
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,710
a little XMPP server is huge but it's

219
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,840
doing a lot more we also cashed a lot

220
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,580
more it's not perfect and more

221
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,930
excitingly and I'm not going to talk

222
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,570
about it much is dendrite which is the

223
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,910
code name of our next-gen home server

224
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,860
which were writing and golang which were

225
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,050
aiming to be at least a couple of orders

226
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,540
of magnitude right literally an order or

227
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,520
two is magnitude faster than the Python

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,559
one and then we've got bridges that

229
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,570
connect through to IRC and everything

230
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,150
orange stuff is from the community so

231
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,309
we've got lots of very servers like

232
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,809
rumor in rust

233
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,420
being written by the community in lots

234
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,520
of gateways and bridges and services

235
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,470
then on the client side we provide the

236
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,450
JavaScript sterically iOS stack and the

237
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,490
android stack and this is split into

238
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,310
three layers in theory the HTTP wrapper

239
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,660
then the cut of UI components and

240
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,199
the app itself at the top and we have

241
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,329
very ugly kind of reference apps and

242
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,880
then you have riot which is a flagship

243
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,680
kind of really glossy hopefully really

244
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,389
glossy app built on top of those and

245
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,889
then meanwhile the community you have

246
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,029
lots of different clients of different

247
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,720
languages if you don't like any of those

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,829
so what do you get

249
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:18,660
very quickly conversation - history

250
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,149
group messaging end-to-end encryption is

251
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:22,680
is the big new one throughout the whole

252
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,850
thing currently implemented in they're

253
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,009
there and they're there for anything on

254
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,199
top of that gets it we're looking at how

255
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,540
to roll it out so everybody else as well

256
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,040
VoIP circulating push notifications yet

257
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,259
the other and you get the idea it's sort

258
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,300
of parity with everything you'd expect

259
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,279
from the communication system so what

260
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,009
does it look like very quickly let's go

261
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,459
and look it right so here's right mmm

262
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,959
having loaded a totally random room

263
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,310
let's get some matrix that falls down

264
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,250
and that's our internal room people

265
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,380
comparing they and their praises are and

266
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,149
this is the dark skin by the way if

267
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,130
anybody has ever got upset the ride was

268
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,779
very very bright before this is now what

269
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,220
it looks like if you turn on the dark

270
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,050
skin and it makes your eyes hurt less if

271
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,880
it go to a big room like matrix HQ then

272
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,500
this has got six thousand people in it

273
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,360
and they're spread over about 600

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,699
servers you can see that matrix IDs here

275
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,660
are of the form username : domain so

276
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,399
it's a bit like an email address but it

277
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,870
deliberately isn't to avoid it being

278
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,759
confused with an email address or jabber

279
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,089
ID you can see people chatting about the

280
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,920
thing read for see it's coming down the

281
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,839
right-hand side doing a funky Tetris

282
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,670
thing why does slack still not have read

283
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,230
receipts if you want a chance system

284
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,079
that has read receipts come to riot on

285
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
the left-hand side I'm in about 400 one

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,240
to one from about 400 rooms and so we're

287
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,889
kind of pushing the limits a little bit

288
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,470
there but some practice it works

289
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,269
relatively and we're all the same

290
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,250
if I can expand out the list you can see

291
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,680
I'm not even lying if all of my wanted

292
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,680
ones hanging around there and we have it

293
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,389
obviously on Android it's on the f-droid

294
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,040
store from a foster perspective and it's

295
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,889
all great okay let me stop talking about

296
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,149
right and so from the interesting stuff

297
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,269
Oh quick stats basically we started two

298
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,380
years ago

299
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,500
we're up to about 750,000 accounts on

300
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,650
the matrix dog mode now we've got 1,500

301
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,080
servers that we can see out there which

302
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,510
take about 50% to the rest of the

303
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,890
traffic so at the moment is a bit

304
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,710
centralized to the original matrix dog

305
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,780
node but the community and the ecosystem

306
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,150
itself is growing out much better graph

307
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,380
is this one which is showing the

308
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,960
messages per day going through matrix

309
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,790
org and we've filtered out all of the

310
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,710
bridged ones going through to IRC and X

311
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,180
and P P so this is the pure native

312
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,010
traffic and you can see we have the

313
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,420
slightly scary exponential whoosh

314
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,000
happening which is why we spend a lot of

315
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,950
our lives doing ops and optimization

316
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,840
work on synapse at the moment to support

317
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,810
that so let's get to the future halfway

318
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,810
through the talk what are the big limits

319
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,300
today identity service already touched

320
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,150
on briefly centralized accounts and then

321
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,730
the big ones spam and reputation and

322
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,160
also metadata protection but that's I

323
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,420
think we're gonna punt that to this

324
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,740
afternoon's talk if people want to come

325
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,560
in here about it so identity service as

326
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,140
we said we have matrix IDs today these

327
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,540
are opaque it's a at user name colon

328
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,730
domain dot org the whole point of these

329
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,440
is they're not meant to be human visible

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
we don't want people to put matrix IDs

331
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,100
on their business cards ironically I

332
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,060
have one on mine but that's a

333
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,460
bootstrapping step so instead the idea

334
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,780
is that you're meant to invite people by

335
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,940
third-party IDs so you take your address

336
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,070
book on your phone and you look at the

337
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,630
email addresses if you want your phone

338
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,760
numbers if you want we'll Skype IDs face

339
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,290
spirit held that user names whatever the

340
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,360
hell it is we don't care we just want to

341
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,280
aggregate all of the other ones out

342
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,310
there and they just map as I said at the

343
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,660
beginning from third party our DS 2

344
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,730
matrix IDs and the current solution is

345
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,980
terrible it's like a thousand lines of

346
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,990
Python running in a little HTTP server

347
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,970
called sident and it's logically

348
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,370
centralized so this is a disaster really

349
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,750
because you shouldn't be having to trust

350
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,300
a centralized ID mapping server also

351
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,560
we've got the problem that the data is

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,700
very sensitive because there's

353
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
everybody's email addresses or a hash of

354
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,970
everybody's email addresses or phone

355
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,100
numbers which is still quite innumerable

356
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,530
and there's also got sort of seed

357
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,660
anonymous and properties we want to

358
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,390
protect identity mappings themselves

359
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,410
have to be trustworthy

360
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,120
so we needs of some of the asserts that

361
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,980
I own my email address we don't want to

362
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,210
get it wrong otherwise they're going to

363
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,650
be hijacking my account

364
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,870
and we also have a problem if somehow

365
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,910
needing to trust the reputation then of

366
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,670
the validators so if I am trusting some

367
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,710
random third party like Facebook to

368
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,350
claim that my Facebook ID Maps my matrix

369
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,820
ID I want to know whether I'd trust

370
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,590
Facebook to manage Facebook IDs or not

371
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,010
if I make sense so possible solutions

372
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,570
this talk is not about telling you what

373
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,370
the solution is it's giving you some

374
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,140
science fiction to muse on about the

375
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,310
things that we're looking at at the

376
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,760
moment

377
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,230
key base is so close to this it's untrue

378
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,720
except it's still basically centralized

379
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,470
even if they published the root of the

380
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,330
mapping database so they maintain and

381
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,000
please by the way contradict me or if I

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,530
get any of this wrong because half of

383
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,210
the points is hoping that somebody's

384
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,410
going to come up to me after this and

385
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,120
say yeah well what you want to do is

386
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,480
this so please do tell me

387
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,400
it also doesn't handle email and doesn't

388
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,900
handle phone numbers which is a bit of a

389
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,160
shame because those are the two main

390
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,290
identifies that people use for human

391
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,560
communication something like block stack

392
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,800
which is obviously blockchain based way

393
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,720
of broadcasting and identities but they

394
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
have the problem as far as I can tell

395
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,310
that they basically blindly trust the

396
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,960
identity validator that if they let you

397
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,650
on the network and you start asserting

398
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,810
email things and they basically say okay

399
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,790
then we let you on the network and if

400
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,990
you say that email address goes there

401
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,540
then we believe you which is fine if

402
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,920
it's a relatively closed network but not

403
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,990
if you're making it completely open then

404
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,730
you have something like web fist anybody

405
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,220
know web fist

406
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,330
nobody knows web fist and I don't know

407
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,620
why so this was written by Brad

408
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,660
Fitzpatrick it's a hackathon a few years

409
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,430
ago and an indie web thing I think

410
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,050
importance and it's specifically for

411
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,990
email uses and domain keys to assert

412
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,430
ownership on email it's basically

413
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,750
decentralized webfinger

414
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,970
hence the name at first and it looks and

415
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,040
promising but it's never taken off that

416
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,550
even even works today persona had some

417
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,380
characteristics of this for email and as

418
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,850
I'm sure everybody knows poor ol persona

419
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,070
rest in peace

420
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,720
then you've got other decentralized

421
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,430
Ledger's there's sovereign from guys

422
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,140
forever name you've got you port built

423
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,880
and sovereign uses its own ledger you've

424
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,410
got you port built on a theory and we've

425
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,290
got Stella which is a its own sort of

426
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,769
ledger system you got name core

427
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,829
as a fork of the Bitcoin thing these are

428
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:40,509
promises for distributing the mapping

429
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,009
data but they still don't really solve

430
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,319
the validated trust problem of who the

431
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,790
hell do I actually trust to start making

432
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,429
assertions on to this database you can

433
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,829
go down the DNS route like good old enum

434
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,019
back-in-the-day onto the classic DNS and

435
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,079
there's the new naming service as a sort

436
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,389
of decentralized alternative to DNS and

437
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:59,860
then in the last couple of days in fact

438
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,660
we've seen the community getting pissed

439
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,459
off with us and saying hang on guys con

440
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,259
this sucks there must be a better

441
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:07,449
identity server than this and somebody

442
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:09,160
just contributes as a Java

443
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,779
alternative implementation at the same

444
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,869
API as could MX is D which allows that

445
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:14,949
leads fall through and it looks a bit

446
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,660
like DNS for this sort of thing and I'm

447
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,799
really running out of time

448
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,170
so the moral of the story here though is

449
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,579
that this isn't anything about matrix

450
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,230
everybody in this room

451
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,360
especially this room needs it I mean

452
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,249
it's basically the problem is saying

453
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,689
hello I've got an email address how do I

454
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,939
map that to a Bitcoin ID or any

455
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,559
decentralized thing could be an XMPP

456
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,559
address it could be ipfs hash I don't

457
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:35,949
care

458
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,350
and yet we still haven't solved it and

459
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,899
this is a huge stumbling block to the

460
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,410
evolution of the decentralized web

461
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,149
decentralized accounts quickly at moment

462
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,709
the rooms are decentralized the matrix

463
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,749
the accounts are not made math your

464
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,549
matrix for alga stuck on a drugstore org

465
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,290
means that we're bound to D and our

466
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,819
Spencer it can't have backup home

467
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,769
service we can't even do secondary MX's

468
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,490
we can't migrate which is a pretty crap

469
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,470
possible futures well and we can use the

470
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,169
identity server to treat em X IDs as a

471
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,789
kind of indirection layer and basically

472
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,648
just say that hey math your matrix talk

473
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,029
should map through to these secondary

474
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,859
ones kind of low-tech that would

475
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,970
probably work quite well and it's

476
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,220
probably what we'll do alternatively we

477
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,349
could go the whole hog ditch DNS use

478
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,449
public fingerprints for use of public

479
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,609
keys and then you have mappings where

480
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,138
you keep the MX IDs but now they're a

481
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:25,209
form of three per third party ID so

482
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,369
you're going to take your MX ID epoch

483
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,830
through to the public key and then use

484
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,510
something like a DHT possibly to

485
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,789
discover which servers are actually

486
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:37,059
hosting that ID third what I had was

487
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,520
spam unfortunately spam is here today

488
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,789
and much of it is bridge four by RC I'm

489
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,049
sure some people here have had the

490
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,840
unpleasant experience of receiving 2500

491
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,390
room invites into their matrix

492
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,490
overnight because I'm script KD on Ma's

493
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,410
net went and enumerated a room and went

494
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,390
and did p.m. spam to everybody and the

495
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,980
bridge usefully bridged it all through

496
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,590
its matrix on the flip side we also have

497
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,470
a potential disaster for messages going

498
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,700
the other way because having gone

499
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,350
unbound everything into one network and

500
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,600
but a simple HTTP API on it unless we

501
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,429
have very good reputation in anti-spam

502
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,049
stuff it just becomes the world's

503
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,360
easiest way to ever spam people short of

504
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
SMTP so it comes in two different

505
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,490
flavors invite spam and public room spam

506
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,770
we can mitigate this has many because we

507
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,570
force an invite handshake for one two

508
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,130
ones but that still means you can end up

509
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,929
with two thousand invite spam and we're

510
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,880
still starting to see idiots coming into

511
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,470
public rooms and saying oh come and buy

512
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,120
viagra or whatever and they do that both

513
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,679
natively at big bridge did from over

514
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,780
systems we also heard the complication

515
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,799
that we then to end encryption

516
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,450
everywhere we county the spam assassin

517
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,950
trick of just going and filtering

518
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,100
everything out so somehow we need Serbia

519
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,900
signing possibly one solution is to

520
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,080
assign reputation to users so obviously

521
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,120
let's talk about reputation quickly

522
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,850
users needs to be able to filter out low

523
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,980
quality content now that can be anything

524
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,960
it can be obvious spam it could be

525
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,429
offensive stuff it stuff they don't

526
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,799
believe in who knows it's somebody they

527
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,179
don't like it's their ex-girlfriend

528
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,450
whatever in a global neutral system this

529
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,000
has to be morally relative we are not in

530
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,429
the business of doing DNS Platt lists

531
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,140
which say this person is a spammer

532
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,910
please never receive anything from them

533
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,010
and said we need to let people curate

534
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,020
their own black lists or their own grey

535
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,970
lists because you know you've got one

536
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,470
guy's terrorist there's another guy's

537
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,330
freedom fight serve on guys sparing miss

538
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,710
enough guys start marketing and

539
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,450
obviously just because I want to filter

540
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,640
out certain political yabbering doesn't

541
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,590
mean that you want to do the same but we

542
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,299
have to do this as I hope everybody

543
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,370
agrees by not creating a filter bubble

544
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,820
which goes and transparently filters

545
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,990
things out based on what your friends

546
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,150
say otherwise you end up in the dystopia

547
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,740
of Facebook that we have today if

548
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,360
everybody's prejudice is being

549
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,890
reinforced because they can't see the

550
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,799
other side of the the view so we have to

551
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,940
do this in a way that users can

552
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,590
visualize and curate the algorithmic

553
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,020
filtering that's going on so possible

554
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,480
solutions well the thing that I've been

555
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,890
thinking about the most is basically

556
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,870
letting every message and matrix be

557
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,040
ratable in a

558
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,870
very freeform way so you can have up

559
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,760
vote and down vote buttons on a message

560
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,500
or you can go a little bit further and

561
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,480
do Facebook or slack style

562
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,040
reactions to them it could be tags so

563
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,300
literally just say well I'm going to

564
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,740
take this as family and it's tagged this

565
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,120
is genius and I'm going to tag this is

566
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,040
stupid and you can obviously see that

567
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,720
the richer the rating the more risk that

568
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,340
the rating itself needs some kind of

569
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,500
moderation system so you want to keep it

570
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,450
probably as simple as possible so we're

571
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,920
floating the even simple up and down

572
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,200
vote voting can go wrong so if somebody

573
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,790
does something embarrassing you can even

574
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,380
abuse that person by deliberately

575
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,940
uploading it so everybody can see the

576
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,310
embarrassing thing they did so very

577
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,530
quickly last loads reputation solutions

578
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,890
a possible solution is that you take all

579
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,270
the up vote down votes that you've seen

580
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,640
and it forms an implicit social graph so

581
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,930
we're not forcing people to say I'm

582
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,490
friends with this person but just the

583
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,810
fact that you've gone and repeatedly

584
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,370
downloaded them probably means you have

585
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,410
some kinds of implicit relationship to

586
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,510
them you can then detect Sibyl attacks

587
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,160
and possible voting rings by doing

588
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,860
cluster analysis on that graph you can

589
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,480
correlate them with the content in the

590
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,830
public messages not the end-to-end

591
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,080
encrypted ones and help visualize

592
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,060
reputation and that could be presented

593
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,130
as something like 95% of users who like

594
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,060
this message also like whatever then you

595
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,610
can also look at transitive trust so oh

596
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,290
by the way ninety percent of your

597
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,880
friends like this too which is a useful

598
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,170
data point even if you choose to ignore

599
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,650
it

600
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,350
and critically you have this huge UX

601
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,300
challenge if letting the user curate and

602
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,830
visualize so it some people don't like

603
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,960
it 90% paid to it you want to do it

604
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,250
anonymously because you don't want to be

605
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,260
gathering metadata to on who likes who

606
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,690
on a global basis so it's at least got

607
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,700
to be sued in most and you can also have

608
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,440
other indicators like I P address is

609
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,070
berating bla bla bla in there so spam

610
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,050
can be done the same way you can make

611
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,400
people spend money to talk and that's

612
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,040
hard and might be over engineered we

613
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,410
don't know yet everybody needs it it's

614
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,880
not just matrix we're talking about

615
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,770
basically having a flexible identity

616
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,730
reputation for the web in general the

617
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,930
talk this afternoon at 3 if you want to

618
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,520
hear about crypto and metadata privacy

619
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,630
what's next

620
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,310
lots of cool stuff which I just said we

621
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,900
need help please run servers

622
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,650
thank you very much

623
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,210
thank you any questions if we have any

624
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:32,909
time sir yes yeah publish them on the

625
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:34,799
blog afterwards the slides will be

626
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:48,259
available on the blog mcfist sorry which

627
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,590
okay yes so the interweb community and D

628
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,590
off of looking also solutions along this

629
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,990
lines and so I've spoken a bunch of some

630
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,759
of the indie web guys nobody is there

631
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,350
sort of said well clearly you just need

632
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,090
to use this we solve this already but

633
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,350
somebody must be it's kind of

634
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,879
everybody's trying to work towards the

635
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:13,169
same thing we must be in anything right

636
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:15,019
so I mean this ain't like webfinger

637
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,570
basically yeah

638
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,610
so the w3c has a working group looking

639
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,019
at basically solving this sort of thing

640
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,100
so you'd hope that we're going to get

641
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,600
there eventually and repeating the

642
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,519
question it was whether there is a
