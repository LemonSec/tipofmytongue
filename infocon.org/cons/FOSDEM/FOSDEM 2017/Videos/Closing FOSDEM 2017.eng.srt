1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,869

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,950
almost over this is a closing session

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,299
these slides are not really finished and

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:19,720
it's mostly my fault excuse me

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,340

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,230
please give feedback there's a feedback

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,119

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,830
feedback section on the internet there's

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,920

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,610
what's got worse please give your

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,180
feedback thank you there is something

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,850
rather important to say about what

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,220
internet service we provide so basically

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,879
we do provide 2 SS IDs on the premise

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,570
nowhere else and these are false demand

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,750
fosston ancient we do not and did not at

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,119
any point provide any Internet I said

21
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,830
after when you or with a different name

22
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,200
we have been informed and confirmed that

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,909
there were several attempts to steal

24
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,689
usernames and passwords of people one

25
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,179
example would be the usage of fosston

26
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:20,420
free Wi-Fi by Google as the SSID it

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,460
showed a login page this was not us this

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,789
was not Google this was someone else we

29
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,359
are taking action with whoever's

30
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,530

36
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,009
been or might have been affected by this

37
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,719
or anyone you know might have been

38
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,950
affected anything also if you want to

this matter

41

security at FOSDEM org use this GPT

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,869
fingerprint again we will be publishing

43

this on our web site we will be putting

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,570
up the slides that's all to be said

45
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,510
about this

46
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,400
so this is a lot shorter than usually is

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,249
we had four keynotes we had six 644 650

48
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:30,769
50 40 thank you

49
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:40,489
45 we even have one more room for next

50
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,400
year which is totally awesome so we get

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,719
in more tracks more deference and all

52
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,950
the other stats will probably be

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,500
uploaded later some ipv6 or it some

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,040
interest ATS these are the number of

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,599
addresses we have on the different days

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,939
for link-local on ipv6 on globally

57
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,879
routable people who manually configured

58
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,000
ipv4 and D configured v6 you are bad

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,519
people please stop and if things break

60
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,430
file box with your vendors or your

61
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,569
developers or whoever found you that and

62
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,519
also as of this afternoon

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,009
we had a total of eleven thousand six

64
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,709
hundred ish MAC addresses this is

65
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,870
probably quite a bit more by now

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,060
and we didn't have weird people claiming

67
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,949
tons of MAC address so this is actually

68
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,759
about the number for devices for video

69
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,729
we had 600 megabit in peak if you want

70
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,439
more details you can also look at -

71
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,799
portavoz de morgue something which I did

72
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,159
not manage to put into the slides most

73
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,659
of the videos are a lot of the videos

74
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,180
are already cut and should be available

75
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,879
shortly if you're a speaker if you're a

76
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,040
deaf room manager you will have got an

77
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,229
email for review links please do this

78
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,359
this makes it unlocked quicker for

79
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,129
everyone to get your content and also a

80
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,469
lot less work for us so that's nice

81
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,389
something just to show and fill fill

82
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,279
space basically this is our new video

83
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,709
dashboard at the NOC or at the walk we

84
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,300
can see the stream the input the output

85
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,729
and the life updates of what's happening

86
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,580
in braking you can also have a look at

87
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,770
our one server and router this

88
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,990
a lot better than last year because it's

89
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,690
not balancing on chairs we have an

90
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,830
actual rack which is really nice and if

91
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,080
you want to see a really

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,229
state-of-the-art render farm which is

93
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,349
modern tuned like if it was done like

94
00:04:52,349 --> 00:05:06,539
five years ago that's that okay

95
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,380
and also we solved those off at coast to

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,900
attendees and will most likely do the

97
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,159
next the same thing next year

98
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,030
because this is cheaper than renting

99
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,280
which is kind of perverse but that's the

100
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,360
way it is so to go to this thank yous

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,819
there should be logos up here and that's

102
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,580
entirely my fault so any sponsors please

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,550
come yell at me and not force them as

104
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,520
general this was a time issue next year

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,680
it'll be better so first of all for the

106
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
venue you'll be

107

161
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,920
say all right also it goes back way way

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,280
way back to the traditional fossum which

163
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,740
has been taking over and which is really

164
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,810
great so it's very nice to see for some

165
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,060
live on this way the story goes back

166
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,980
even to people before us who were in a

167
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,260
hurry and and they were explaining how

168
