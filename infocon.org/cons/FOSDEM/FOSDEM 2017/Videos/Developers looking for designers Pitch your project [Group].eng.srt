and so we have been doing this since the

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,869
since the first since the first open

5
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,060

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,039
basically just a as you could see on the

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,689
schedule just a session to pitch your

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,749
own project and to ask for design help

9
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:26,939
so if you have an open source project

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,619
where you need any design help

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,409
whatsoever like a logo or some

12
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,150
interaction design or just a design

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,579
review or something like that yeah this

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,440
is your your chance now to put your

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,460
project we've it's just yeah voluntarily

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,150
anyone who comes up I know some people

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,520
who already show their project right you

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,130
for example and and so you just have

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,920
three minutes and just quickly explain

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,760
what yeah it's hardcore so we don't have

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,190
a lot of time so just quickly be concise

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,050
describe what you project as you can

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,470
come up here and just open your website

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,729
or your github or any repository or

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,950
whatever just quickly explain what your

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,950
project does how you need design hub and

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,320
how to contact you and your three

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,140
minutes that we call and also if you

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,560
come up here and present your project we

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,659
also ask you to if you didn't do that

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,749
already afterwards I go to our jobs page

32
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,810
and submit that what you presented as a

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,789
job posting so it's also there for

34
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,819
anyone who doesn't attend right now okay

35

great I'll hold it for you okay so this

42
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,160
is about Carla Carla is like a metal

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,069
inter so you may know winters there's

44
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,950
like usually one to doing one specific

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,580
kind of

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,520
on one language so you usually need more

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,250
of those and you don't want to use multi

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,570
lots of those tools

49
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,690
koalas like a metal enter and it

50
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,060
basically uses those tools for you is

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,390
one unified user interface 466

52
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,210
programming languages and usually more

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,610
than one analysis available for every

54
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,110
language we need design help in terms of

55
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,480
usability and what we basically want to

56
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
do is a usability test so all that you

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,850
get from me right now is koala that I oh

58
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,870
that's our website and I want you to set

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,420
that up for a project to do something

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,660
reasonable with it and figure out if it

61
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,570
works for you or not especially if it

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,030
doesn't work for you you can fill in the

63
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,650
results at qualify there was slash

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,980
usability or you could just file as an

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,500
issue so it's very simple go to column

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,900
value and later to koala video slash

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,910
usability thank you thank you remember

68
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,550
to put that in the jobs Fort Eustis

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,870
usability there will be like a

70
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,709
questionnaire ok cool I mean it's not

71
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:54,510
cool that it's a Google Form so whoever

72
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,090
wants to come just come up like I don't

73
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,530
pay attention who raise their hands just

74
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:19,560
just come on maybe don't open this ten

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,640
euros I don't know where I'm just

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,850
[Music]

77
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,210
all right so you got a rough idea of

78
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,620
koala no and so you haven't seen

79
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,750
anything

80
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,560
thank you so you got a rough idea with

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,940
koala there's something you want to do

82
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,280
like we want to integrate it into github

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,460
so it's actually usable it's very so it

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,290
can have a seamless integration to get

85
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,270
up and you know I can see the comments

86
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,010
which are the butter Lynch has produced

87
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,860
by koala am i right and github so the

88
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,220
idea said it would look like something

89
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,320
like that so that's the product what I

90
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,240
do when I got you can't see it at all

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,500
yes so that's the eventual outcome so

92
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,990
not much design work to be done there

93
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,300
because it's get up basically but what

94
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
we are thinking about the cell to do a

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,200
nice configuration and so that's our

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
approach for the configuration so far

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,630
yeah we're not designers it's basically

98
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,780
not pretty nice we just try just try it

99
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,360
something but we really need some

100
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,710
feedback on that um how to make that how

101
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,300
to make a good experience for users on

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,640
that point so there will be a

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:48,230
questionnaire yet and if you have any

104
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,640
people on there if you would like to

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,920
contribute to this summer would be very

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,710
happy to see it call that I admit or

107
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,320
visit us that get made up I oh thank you

108
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,540
very much

109
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,709
[Applause]

110
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,020
yep I'm Michael from frontier car 20 car

111
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,480
is a decentralized social network we are

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,270
here we exist for several years you

113
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,480
might know the s4 are we are you can

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,060
talk to them as well we are open source

115
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,600
based on PHP and coal and we really

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,220
desperately need help for designers for

117
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,220
example this homepage here is kind of

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,770
ugly it's totally old and we try to

119
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:02,870
do a new homepage that we really rewrote

120
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,750
everything and it looks even uglier

121
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,950
because it's just yeah like and so we

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,370
really need people who are willingly to

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,650
help us just these yeah just for from

124
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,270
you users for people who are interested

125
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,370
in it so that they don't sees this mess

126
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,720
and say hey what the yeah so that

127
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,460
they can do the first set can see oh

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,120
yeah that's looking nice and yeah and

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,700
this is one of the things other things

130
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
would be maybe if there are people who

131
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,230
are good and user experience stuff and

132
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,400
so could have a look as well at our

133
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,630
system could try like any one of the

134
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,650
other talks were people well this one

135
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,500
could ask people for testing why people

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,690
are creating an account but never come

137
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,420
back and this whole stuff would be and

138
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:16,340
totally appreciate it so these are all

139
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,430
some weird ugly things I don't know

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,670
where the email addresses point to so

141
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,570
best would be on github the keyboard is

142
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,900
really

143
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,500
so this is the address such 20/20 car

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,980
and we could be reached over of course

145
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,020
contacting here with issues and so on

146
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,990
and of course I will try to at a job

147
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:15,570
entry as well yet disregard my history

148
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:22,320
or whatever I hope you didn't see

149
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,920
anything incriminating

150
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,910
[Laughter]

151
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:43,140
hello project difference we built our

152
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,570
about free software is nice because we

153
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,490
can modify the sources share resources

154
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,190
edit the sources and pass them on but

155
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,140
with nobody uses sources we use binaries

156
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,060
and we need to believe that the binary

157
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,670
comes from a given source and the way to

158
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,740
overcome this belief is enable everybody

159
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,800
to rewrite this exact same binary so

160
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
this is reponsible builds as a technical

161
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,529
project and we are looking for

162
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,540
Louisville and

163
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,660
[Music]

164
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,290
so I'm harder from Debian but involved

165
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,200
is actually not space for Bitcoin who

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,440
Abu Dhabi and f-droid free VST if you

167
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,620
don't need to net PSD Nick Salvati

168
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,140
details so we are looking at yoga for

169
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,940
this purpose of its project for

170
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,190
everybody and we have a page describing

171
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,820
the logo

172
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,270
matching the Debian wiki just search for

173
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,940
reproducible Louisville which is not the

174
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:19,830
right page oh yeah so there is there are

175
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,110
16 ideas for a possible slow boss

176
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,790
some are usable as low but some are not

177
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:39,170
I like this this is also nice

178
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,920
or this of the rabbit producing I don't

179
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,490
know you can make me my name is saga

180
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,800
from Debian thank you thank you

181
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,410
and just one question how long are you

182
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,090
looking for because you have all these

183
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:15,180
ideas no I mean how long it wouldn't be

184
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,880
so bad but all the keys have the symbols

185
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,560
rubbed off so you can't see what you're

186
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,530
typing what is this that I need to show

187
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,340
off whatever that's not helpful at all

188
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,850
okay so this is me Daniel Quinn and

189
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,900
anyone here played with a game called

190
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,870
Gowalla do you remember it was a while

191
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,350
ago

192
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,050
no it was a great game I fell in love

193
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,330
with it and then they sold out to

194
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,710
Facebook and Facebook was like screw you

195
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,270
guys and they just closed all company

196
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,740
stole the staff and imported them so

197
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,410
when it died my friend and I got very

198
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,210
upset and we wanted to bring the game

199
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,500
back and we were gonna make it better

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,480
and my friend she had this brilliant

201
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,620
idea she was gonna come up with this

202
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,020
really cool game that basically years

203
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,970
later some other company came along he

204
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,320
came up with something you may have

205
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,610
heard of it pokemon gold between the

206
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,170
time that she had the idea and the time

207
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,760
that they came out with it I started

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,310
writing it and I swear to God like four

209
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,820
years ago I had a fully functional

210
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,590
it was the coolest game ever if you

211
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,520
really liked talking to JSON API but it

212
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,110
was this cool game where you could walk

213
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,280
down to the water and it would know that

214
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,530
you're near water and it would check the

215
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,420
position of the stars and change the

216
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,310
monsters near you based on that there

217
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,140
was leveling there was upgrades all

218
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,700
kinds of stuff it's still there it's all

219
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,220
on github you can play with it feel like

220
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,620
but it's just an API it's really ugly I

221
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,020
need it to be sexy I need pictures I

222
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,450
need illustrations and I get anything

223
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,790
that's prettier than an API so you're

224
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,870
raising your handle good no not at all

225
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,440
because you know copyright yeah well

226
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,410
that's the other thing but the thing is

227
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,790
Pokemon is kind of a problem because the

228
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,920
the creatures themselves are limited and

229
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,500
the way the game is designed for us is

230
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,900
they're designed to just be we can add

231
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,660
new breeds of creatures based on other

232
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,550
aspects that we can get so for example

233
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,740
right now with your Lawton longitude I

234
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,960
can get the position of the stars in the

235
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
cosmos I can get the current weather

236
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,320
where you are I can get the historical

237
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,550
web you also figure out whether or not

238
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,720
it's colder than it used to be and

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,220
generate a different cold monster or not

240
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,730
and the region you are nationally so the

241
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,980
monsters all have regions because

242
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
there's also like one in a hundred

243
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,220
chance that you may pick up a tourist so

244
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,960
you're in the UK and you're collecting

245
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,250
monsters and they all have little UK

246
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,540
flags on them but every once in a while

247
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,280
ones from Japan and now you get this

248
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,660
idea you want to go all around the world

249
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,770
and collect monsters from all around the

250
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,950
world so look all of this stuff is it

251
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,660
was fun for people like me who like to

252
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,970
collect things so I want to just make

253
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,430
the game so I can play the game but if

254
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,810
any of you guys would also like to play

255
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,550
the game we're perhaps making into some

256
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,900
money if we can actually make it into a

257
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,300
functional object it'll be awesome but

258
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
yeah come and get a hold of me my

259
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,500
contact info is hidden by that totally

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,540
useless thing at the bottom so just look

261
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,420
at me I'm Daniel Quinn org go to my

262
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,220
website there and you can contact me

263
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,360
through that thanks

264
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,970
[Applause]

265
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:39,020
let me know if you need help hi

266
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,630
Christine prison means shiver in English

267
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,540
Philistine and German anyway I'm a

268
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,240
researcher in human-computer interaction

269
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,260
at in really ill and I'm developing a

270
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,900
tool to help us researchers and HCI

271
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,290
researchers to observe how people use

272
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,620
their own apps so I'm going to introduce

273
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,780
it by to use cases some time ago I was

274
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,070
working on a project consisting in

275
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,890
observing now some designers fine sounds

276
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,560
explore sounds if it was like ingredient

277
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,970
lists but if the tools that are

278
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,850
available to record this are like a

279
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,060
QuickTime Player or other tools but you

280
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,080
cannot get the click and like input from

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,620
the keyboard

282
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,960
you cannot extract it as a separate file

283
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,390
for analysis so it's not convenient to

284
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,010
annotate everything by hand and so we

285
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:49,050
wanted to develop another solution like

286
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,410
it's going to be really small but it's a

287
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,670
browser that combines similarity of

288
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,430
sound based on tags and based on the

289
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,109
sound itself so to evaluate it like for

290
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,349
usability we wanted to do quantitative

291
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,959
analysis and then we had to compare this

292
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,849
application with another one that they

293
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,030
used and maybe some of you might have

294
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,109
recognized

295
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,209
I guess that is too small this is pro

296
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,569
tools from Digidesign avid there are no

297
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,130
user

298
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,380
available so we had to reverse engineer

299
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,660
engineer some so at last this is the app

300
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm working on

301
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,530
it's called inspector widget like there

302
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,030
is a reference to a famous animated

303
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,590
series again back in the days so the

304
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,840
idea is this is the recording of the

305
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,580
desktop of anybody's computer and by

306
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,370
using a scratch like language we can

307
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,040
program annotation annotations and then

308
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,090
browse the video in synchrony

309
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,320
synchronize to these annotations for

310
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,500
instance this is the file browser of

311
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,710
ProTools how can we see when people are

312
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,410
like browsing for sounds making some

313
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,500
cries to find sounds playing back so if

314
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,690
we don't have access to the like the Dom

315
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,940
for web applications or well the

316
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,560
structure of widgets how can we do that

317
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,590
so we select regions and we extract them

318
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:25,550
from the video so we need people that we

319
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,210
would have the design of the application

320
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,260
but more so users that are designers

321
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,180
themselves that might use this tool for

322
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,520
contextual inquiries or usability

323
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,760
testing I would want them to try it for

324
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
now I mean almost the only developer of

325
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,430
it so it's only available for Mac sorry

326
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,870
as well and the time is up Thanks and if

327
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,840
you want to reach me while the project

328
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,490
is on github and if you this website my

329
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,650
contact is going to be visible somehow

330
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:18,829
[Applause]

331
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,289
hi everybody my name is Rio and I'm from

332
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,269
the dayz program basically we try to

333
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,480
build the Internet's of energy and make

334
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,450
energy as a common basically we are team

335
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,200
F for something like today 10 10 people

336
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,909
it's a weapon design program for people

337
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,190
who consider energy as a rather common

338
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,580
and what we're trying to do basically is

339
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,580
to work on levels you can monitor the

340
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,200
conception and the production of energy

341
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,649
and make it sensible or has a

342
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:14,109
representation for it for their users

343
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:17,950
and for the people who are directly in

344
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,710
touch with energy let's say this is a

345
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,960
first level the second level is the

346
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,070
software level so we worked with kind of

347
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,929
block chain technology called FM

348
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:31,179
basically and what we what we're trying

349
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:35,129
to do is basically how you let's say

350
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:38,019
designing an infrastructure for people

351
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,830
to share to directly share or sell

352
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,220
energy to each other instead of let's

353
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,009
say selling the energy to the grid or to

354
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,590
another producer so this is basically

355
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,850
the project which were working on we are

356
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,059
looking for help from designers first of

357
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,830
all for the design of the contributions

358
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,950
because we'd like well this project is

359
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,799
open source so we like people to get

360
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,080
involved in both the design of the

361
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,789
interaction between the people and the

362
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,009
energy actually this is the first thing

363
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,830
the second the second thing is that we

364
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,369
made design help to basically design the

365
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:21,399
governance of the energy what we are

366
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,109
trying to do is basically to build a

367
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,610
micro scale or micro grid energy

368
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,330
I'll educate and one of the thing that

369
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,550
is quite complicated is how you deal

370
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,679
with the local marketplace actually and

371
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,250
this local marketplace has to be let's

372
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,820
say design as to you have governance

373
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,059
that is rightly designed for interaction

374
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,520
between the peers that is you say the

375
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,770
producers the mill operators the

376
00:21:48,770 --> 00:22:18,290
citizens etc etc thank you so we are

377
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,540
working on the new project which is a

378
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,090
project for implementing a payment

379
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,600
system that allows anonymous payments

380
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,670
but receiving the money is not anonymous

381
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:39,140
so we have this website talonnet you can

382
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:48,230
find the developers page and yeah let's

383
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,580
hear it so just very briefly the system

384
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,500
looks like the way you would use it you

385
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,059
have a bank account with for instance

386
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:04,340
euros you Vidro coins into your wallet

387
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,170
which runs in your browser or mobile

388
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,420
phone that these are anonymous coins

389
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,179
that each represent euro but it can be

390
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,270
tied to dollars or whatever else as well

391
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,050
so this system is not a currency but

392
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,750
just a payment system so it is intended

393
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,970
to replace credit cards and paper and

394
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,059
similar systems so what happens in the

395
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,700
system is that you you have to your bank

396
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,160
and exchange exchange is the your

397
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,530
currency to Animus coins and you pay

398
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,480
with your anonymous coins to merchants

399
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,580
and the merchants can

400
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,440
go back to the exchange and get back the

401
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,100
euros or whatever currency you have and

402
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,980
so what we started doing we we have

403
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,540
started implementing the whole system

404
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,679
and we have a browser extension using

405
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,020
the web extensions API and what we need

406
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,340
healthy is designing the layout and the

407
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,590
design of the extensions pages we have

408
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,380
these browser pop-ups in the corner

409
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,559
usually so we have value need we need to

410
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:12,080
display the the current balance and

411
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,990
confirmation pages for payments things

412
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,360
that is so all the layout so it's HTML

413
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,390
CSS basically design work that we need

414
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,120
help with and so if you go to Tara

415
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,390
dotnet on the developers page you can

416
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,150
find the contact information we have a

417
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:34,429
mailing list so yeah discussion so we

418
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,350
have this mailing list you can send a

419
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,220
message there and if you would like to

420
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,120
have with the design of the graphics

421
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,470
engines

422
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:52,730
that's what it mainly and thanks okay so

423
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,059
that was it

424
00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:01,130
so everyone as for design hope now

425
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,920
please go to open source design dotnet

426
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,890
slash jobs and there is a link to post a

427
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,890
job and it's basically just adding like

428
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,740
a markdown file to a repository so you

429
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,600
just put in the info there and I think

430
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,550
we even have the we have this form up

431
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,010
already okay so it's even a form not a

432
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,090
yeah exactly and right and basically and

433
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,820
I kind of also a job or or if you want

434

collective so we're on github.com slash

436
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,630
open source design if you want to get

437
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,700
involved yeah it's all open to

438
