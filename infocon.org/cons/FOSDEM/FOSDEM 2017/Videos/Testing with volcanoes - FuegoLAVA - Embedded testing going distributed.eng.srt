1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:13,129
so hello guys so today let me talk a

2
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:19,480
little about messing up fuego and lava

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,070
so let me quickly introduce myself I'm

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,870
Yan Simone Miller sent me an email if

5
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,180
you want some more info later about it

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,250
the slides are also uploaded I do the

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,950
releases NCI for AGL automotive-grade

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,340
Linux if you haven't seen our demo in aw

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:52,880
take a quick look before you leave if

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,730
you just have one target and develop on

11
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,120
it

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,370
yeah it's perfectly fine to have

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,190
everything on your desk yeah easily

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,549
accessible to you the problem which I

15
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:10,670
have then is because well mine looks

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,130
more like this so the picture is from

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,709
from our killer 8 colleagues free

18
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:22,579
electrons and that's just one of the

19
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:28,310
drawers yeah yeah so you see it starts

20
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,719
to get a little messy and if I put all

21
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,049
our old boards in one place I'm not

22
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,799
always there right so that's why that's

23
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,099
the motivation behind that yeah and here

24
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,249
our guys from the narrow they have for

25
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:51,429
example here the I forgot the name

26
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:55,669
handle board right we have your nice

27
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:58,459
stacks of panda boards that are hooked

28
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:05,560
up to lava now when we looked at the

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,399
frameworks for for a GL hmm we were

30
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,620
looking at well what's out there in the

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,950
distribution space they exist autotest

32
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,740
yeah there are things like

33
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,760
open QA hmm yeah that's a little bit

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,010
graphics but we are embedded so they

35
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,110
also open QA is more about taking

36
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,570
screenshots and it can do all the

37
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,320
desktop click stuff so they are probably

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,520
not for us

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,070
embedded sports yeah we ended then up

40
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,630
with well homebrew stuff mmm no okay so

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,120
we end up with lava lava does the board

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,800
farm stuff very well yeah my absolute

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:03:04,280
favorite we also use forego that is

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,210
because it comes out of the LTS I

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:15,470
project companies in AGL use ltsi

46
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,930
kernels so we have that one also to play

47
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,770
with what we also see is we go from kind

48
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,130
of yeah non distributed specific

49
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,030
environment to distribute it yeah that's

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,100
a clear trend okay lava I will skip that

51
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,920
we talked about that just a few points

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,290
basically my observations completely

53
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,610
subjective very good to support board

54
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,220
farms or multiple boards of the same

55
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,040
type yeah that's that's how it scales

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,200
nicely a lot of deployment mechanisms

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,940
even microcontrollers the new slave

58
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,270
workers set up it's very slick what I

59
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,600
also found out in our initial it's a

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,298
little is it's a steep learning curve

61
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,060
yeah and I read the documentation and I

62
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,730
okay now what what do I have to do yeah

63
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,090
if you need to get into it a little

64
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,710
and we'll get to that yeah okay so in

65
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,720
contrast what is fuego so they will

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,669
evolved out of the JTA project

67
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,210
so the ltsi guys set up this project 288

68
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,030
jenkins test automation so it's a

69
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,570
jenkins involved we basically have a

70
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,810
fooled jenkins at hand and flew a go is

71
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,900
basically a jenkins prepackaged with

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,350
abstraction scripts and a battery of

73
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,440
tests and all of this inside the

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,229
container now we can debate if the

75
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,370
container is really the nicest thing and

76
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,900
on the one side it's nice on the other

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,910
side if you give that to your IT

78
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,780
department they say and now yeah we want

79
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,570
to use puppet and Sybil and that doesn't

80
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,130
really fit we'll see maybe we will

81
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,700
change change it a little bit to use for

82
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,950
example drinking drop in the underneath

83
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,080
and then you can just add it to your

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,940
existing drinking that might be a better

85
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,270
option anyway so we have quite a few I

86
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,830
don't know the total number but I think

87
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,150
it's like 45 already existing test runs

88
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,260
with complete parsing with complete

89
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,130
result parsing so that is kind of the

90
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,900
big plus here yeah we have a large

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,930
number of already predefined tests with

92
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,380
complete reporting companies like

93
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,320
Fujitsu they added kind of reports over

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,900
I don't know how many iterations and

95
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,639
yada yada yada so it's very good at the

96
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
reporting because you have a full

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,500
Jenkins where you can do plugins and I

98
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,950
don't know the setup compared to

99
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,650
lava which even runs completely on a

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,610
Raspberry Pi you here you have a Jenkins

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,390
and Java so it's a little more heavy and

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,150
it evolved from a complete local lab

103
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,720
setup so it has no notion about well my

104
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,900
board is now at home yeah and my Jenkins

105
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,710
is over here it accesses the birds

106
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:11,610
usually over SSH when the board is up it

107
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,190
has no well no built-in way to deploy a

108
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,200
filesystem Buddha board doesn't know

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,690
anything about it it just assumes the

110
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,050
developer might be sdcard and power up

111
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,150
the board and then goes to Jenkins and

112
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,500
doesn't okay so I said there's like nice

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,090
I cannot use it yeah for our whatever

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,420
code review automation is like I I'm not

115
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,630
going to press buttons here okay so

116
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,200
let's see what we can do a I want to

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,060
distribute the tests and I want to

118
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,540
aggregate the results now let's say none

119
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,690
of those tools could do everything so

120
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,030
let's see what we can do so distribute

121
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,970
the tests another problem that we have

122
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,080
is I don't want to hurt all the board's

123
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,450
yeah so for example my colleague has

124
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:21,210
board X I have board Y let's have a

125
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,260
setup where we can share those boards

126
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,370
for testing that works Christ nicely the

127
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,980
new lava has the so-called pipeline

128
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,000
setup or v2 setup and you can have the

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,429
satellite lab which is just a worker on

130
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,169
a raspberry for example and it connects

131
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,770
to the master over an encrypted

132
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,810
connection perfect

133
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,470
so I have my board at home you have

134
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,139
viewers at home we connect to the same

135
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,949
master and we can now test multiple

136
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:04,949
boards the only requirement is here

137
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:09,300
power needs to be controlled through a

138
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,180
relay board there are nice hats for the

139
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,970
raspberry and whatever or also nice

140
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,749
relay boxes for our network that's

141
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:24,089
perfectly fine cereal and what I usually

142
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:26,939
do is an internal network just for the

143
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:32,009
device under test which means basically

144
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,129
that's my external network this is

145
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,649
basically firewall because I haven't set

146
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,439
up any nap so it's completely decoupled

147
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:43,709
yeah

148
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,860
actually hmm that could be a nice VT at

149
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,920
home set up for testing it just need a

150
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,829
referee a relay board and the board to

151
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:58,769
test it now aggregate the results that's

152
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,259
now a little tricky we get the

153
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,290
individual results basically usually the

154
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,399
thumb up from down but I want more I

155
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,829
want to know what happened I want the

156
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,509
full lock file so I need a way to

157
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,439
aggregate them store them and that's

158
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:19,199
where kind of the hue go calm part comes

159
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:22,829
in place because it's built to run the

160
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:23,370
test

161
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,009
fetch the results post process the whole

162
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,920
thing so that's where the strengths here

163
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:37,829
so let's combine those two so it's

164
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,929
completely fresh I think I uploaded the

165
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,620
code like one and a half day ago

166
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,389
midnight so it's on it's not on github

167
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,800
it's on big packet big bucket deal 9pf I

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,990
should have put the link in anyway

169
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,149
Franco had a nice target setup link at

170
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,850
our target yeah target set up Inc if

171
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,350
that arrival exists executed you know

172
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,879
perfect oh by the way there are a few

173
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,500
places so where to add lava now yeah

174
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,329
forego has the notion of a transport SSH

175
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:27,060
and do I do it add it there if we want

176
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,420
to access the board we bring it up yeah

177
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,230
but we have no way to do some flow

178
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,879
control in that case now when do we know

179
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,180
that we don't need that SSH connection

180
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,000
anymore and so on so I was like nice

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,279
idea would be completely transparent but

182
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,879
I have absolutely no knowledge how long

183
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,850
a job runs okay so target setup link is

184
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,519
coupled with a drop with the drop so I

185
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,360
know start and okay I still had to add

186
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,079
target teardown link because that boys

187
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,430
never thought of so I just added that

188
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,209
and then we submit a job to lava to

189
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:16,620
bring up the board therefore I need a

190
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,750
lava drop template

191
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,709
I created a settings file for just

192
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,689
environment variables for for Fuego and

193
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:30,630
then fill in the kernel I wand and so on

194
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,040
and construct my my job for lava it

195
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,009
still uses as its age to connect to the

196
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,130
board once it up so that's a little yeah

197
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,480
I want to fix that actually I want to go

198
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,649
from for a go to the board and don't

199
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,790
need that ssh thing because yeah it

200
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,309
still assumes that the board is in my

201
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,079
local network so right now i have

202
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:06,360
whatever VPN in between and in my yeah

203
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,540
proof of concept here it's it's using a

204
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,070
hacking session ahead

205
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,170
session is basically a test which

206
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,000
exposes person education and waits until

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,050
I say I'm done

208
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,230
yeah that's but it's nice because from

209
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,120
the outside you can go ahead and connect

210
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:35,279
to the board okay now let's see if that

211
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,529
works let me take the mouse that's

212
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:50,459
faster so that's nah

213
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,649
where is the thing okay let's see here

214
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm using already the next branch so

215
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,399
that's not the master that's already

216
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,930
next well we have here such test plants

217
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,250
I use the Raspberry Pi as my test device

218
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,660
under test and ignore the docker that's

219
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,740
just the test plan name anyway so let's

220
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,500
take a look at one of these it's

221
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,110
actually running right now and let's

222
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,310
take a quick look so we start up and at

223
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:39,029
some point over here we go into the link

224
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,529
setup we submit the job well and then

225
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,810
there is one thing now I don't know when

226
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,690
actually SSH is up so I do a poor-man's

227
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,079
aah there yeah so it would be it would

228
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,260
be nice if I get the for example lava

229
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,779
noes lava knows when for example the

230
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,250
login were sent yeah I don't get that

231
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,360
yet through lava tool would be cool yeah

232
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,350
I think there is the isn't there it's

233
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,360
not job job details wait for there is

234
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,870
some wait

235
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,620
but I think that's the plan to have to

236
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:33,370
expose that right yeah okay but I have

237
00:15:33,370 --> 00:16:01,199
to send the event in my teen might yeah

238
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,870
yeah yeah well here I mean - I'm

239
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,300
basically in Jenkins which has to do the

240
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,699
flow control well right now I just do

241
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,639
netcat for 22 a couple of times and

242
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,889
whatever yeah it's a little bit torment

243
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,100
Pauling but it does the job

244
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,730
yeah and if that succeeds fine board is

245
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,730
up and then Fuego takes over over SSH it

246
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,519
does then it's drop cause SSH a couple

247
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,490
of times runs the job and so on and in

248
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,360
the end yeah I basically bring down the

249
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,509
job yeah at the moment I cancel it's a

250
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,990
little harsh

251
00:16:50,069 --> 00:17:00,279
yeah and that is kind of a first poor

252
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,079
man's implementation how to connect

253
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,780
these to the plus side I get remote port

254
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,280
support I get multiple boards multiple

255
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,398
boards of the same type for a goal still

256
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:27,789
couples the board with one executor so

257
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:30,490
it actually just knows I can execute one

258
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,760
thing at a time if I now have multiple

259
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,540
boards with

260
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,200
Lara I can so I can say I have four

261
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,380
executors and execute four of those test

262
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,230
instances at the same time yeah which is

263
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,560
nice yeah to scale that because they all

264
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,460
run for I don't know how many minutes so

265
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,210
that's a plus and that also means it

266
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,580
makes sense to attach that whole flow

267
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,970
control to the job because then you can

268
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,780
say okay

269
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,420
multiple executors multiple boards in

270
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,030
the let's let's say lava is to

271
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,370
orchestrate her in that in in that in

272
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,000
that sense and I can scale and gain

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,240
speed here okay

274
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,550
so let's see quick how to so it's yeah

275
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,030
yeah after link okay so it's on

276
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,670
bitbucket downside of lava they all

277
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,420
downside of fuego they have they are

278
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,790
it's quite large because they ship the

279
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,540
source tar balls for the test in one

280
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,260
thing in in there get repo anyway here

281
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,150
you create the container so there is

282
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,840
Fuego and Fuego - core core is the

283
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,900
actual engine and that is just a

284
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,730
container so basically here you create

285
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,300
the container and so on you create a

286
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,150
board and note in Jenkins and this

287
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,910
create this script basically creates the

288
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,990
varieties jobs plus the wrapper which

289
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,850
calls it plus the batch job that calls

290
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,190
it I'm sitting on next already so the

291
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,200
newest stuff it works meanwhile collect

292
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:51,270
quite well and I can run drops quite

293
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,690
reliably even if I get other jobs in

294
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,540
between the question is it would be

295
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,790
better to not rely on the calling and

296
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,830
the timeout so that's something to to

297
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:09,330
really improve the handling of the

298
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:15,210
board's is then very solid and basically

299
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:21,780
with two scripts added we are done the

300
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,880
downsides hmm let's see so we had pretty

301
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,450
fine timeouts in Fuego a test runs three

302
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,800
minutes yeah

303
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,160
wait a minute yeah if I have to set

304
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,270
submit the job and then wait for the

305
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,600
board to become free yeah so those

306
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,140
hard-coded timeouts we're just bogus

307
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,180
it was at the wrong place because it was

308
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,950
at the overall job so we need to make

309
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,610
those more fine-grained and I'm

310
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,110
discussing with the Fuego guys how to

311
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,460
how to do that another downside here is

312
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,020
the job in Fuego starts with built the

313
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,580
test while it blocks the board in this

314
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,240
setup and so we grab the board just to

315
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,450
start compiling copy over the stuff run

316
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,190
it

317
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,110
retrieve the things and then we also do

318
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,450
the reporting before we close the board

319
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,910
okay that is not optimal and we are

320
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,580
looking ok what is the minimal set got

321
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,080
the copy over run retrieve and then we

322
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,620
want to small down the the time we use

323
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,680
the boards actually yeah that would be

324
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,770
nice if we get some progress messages

325
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:56,110
that would allow me to skip the the SSH

326
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,410
polling and say ok the login was sent

327
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,420
the board is up yeah that would simplify

328
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,320
it to just a call to love a tool and

329
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,050
done that might be nice yeah I have to

330
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,720
figure out a way how to how to overcome

331
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,630
the SSH for Fuego not sure what to do

332
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,170
right now yet what type that should be

333
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,360
yeah so what needs to be done yeah clean

334
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,330
up I'm sitting on top of next that

335
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,220
branch needs to be cleaned up themselves

336
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,700
so there's some some work to do I hope

337
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,910
we have some something for they are like

338
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,130
in two three weeks or four ALC let's see

339
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,930
until then it might be interesting to

340
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,770
still match up with the transport info a

341
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,650
go SSH serial

342
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,820
also as you have seen here I do one job

343
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,440
bring it up tear it down it might be

344
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,410
nice to say okay pool five drops yeah

345
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,940
which means bring it up do five stuff

346
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,520
and then tear it down so some other job

347
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,040
can take over so that pooling might be

348
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,920
nice and yeah for my use case I need an

349
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,810
alternative for the local SSH thing so

350
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:37,110
we can get the the full remote lab

351
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:47,740
workflow done yeah and try it the

352
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,190
individual projects lava fuego or

353
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,930
contribute to projects like colonel CI

354
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,040
highly recommended I run a lot myself

355
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,410
what is important now with all those

356
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,590
test frameworks yeah we should make sure

357
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,680
that we use the same same way to

358
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,470
describe the test results so we can

359
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,970
actually share those so again at that

360
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,700
point we should not reinvent the wheel

361
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,380
yeah and do the same test three times

362
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,540
just because it's a different format

363
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,510
yeah and we've with with some share test

364
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,870
results we can do better

365
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,740
well analytics in the end because we can

366
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,620
only learn if we see what changes over

367
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,860
time

368
00:24:47,670 --> 00:25:04,560
okay questions yeah I did that I I have

369
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,760
to time out and I check if if if 422

370
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,300
comes up or not it works yes but if with

371
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,830
the idea of the satellite workers I

372
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,460
don't want a fault VPN I just want some

373
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,910
way to Frager trust needs two things it

374
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,250
needs to the terminal and it needs to

375
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,270
wait how to get the test files over and

376
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,070
if I get that if I get a different

377
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:41,940
transport basically I'm happy yeah but

378
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,940
that's something to spend some cycles on

379
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,570
because yeah it needs to be secure

380
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:02,220
