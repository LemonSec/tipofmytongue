1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,589
all right

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,880
yeah I guess we can use sarin however

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,020
one I'm undressing I work as a designer

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,580
at Red Hat's yeah during a day-to-day

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,520
work I work in a product called carpet

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,599
which is a server administration UI but

7
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,070
I also been involved in the genome

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,929
project for about 10 years now

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,869
and today I'm gonna talk about wanted to

10
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,030
get Oh maps called the maps and how we

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,129
used interviews to implement a new

12
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:43,000
functionality in that software so it

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,820
started with micros lived on one of the

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,370
developers he found this bug and is that

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,430
like yeah we should probably get some

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,609
some support for publishers notation

17
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,480
because currently we have that you can

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,230
get from point A to point B by either by

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,160
walking or biking or driving but he was

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,780
like well what if someone wants to take

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,530
the bus right so yeah we need time for

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,660
this and I thought yeah there should be

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,440
fairly fairly straightforward so I grew

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,590
up in a very very small village in the

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,240
countryside of Sweden

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,660
it's called becoming about a hundred

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,370
people lived there

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,190
I actually I didn't grow up there I grew

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,150
up like up there so it's like quite far

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,950
away like it takes you two kilometers to

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,040
get into this place where the bus goes

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
three times a day if you don't get

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,330
somewhere and these things I live in the

34
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,630
central government Sweden's second

35
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,630
bigger city and I have a bus or a tram

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,760
if I want to go somewhere about every

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,240
third minute just outside my door so I

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,800
felt like well this should be easy

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,910
I knew both the scream so this right REI

40
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,280
I be

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,020
I've been living in a place where it

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,569
went was very very few Basinger crowns

43
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,400
and I live in a place where it's like

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,220
very hot trams and maybe I took a bus in

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,770
Paris at some point also so I should

46
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,970
know all this and I would just need to

47
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,739
yeah use my relative process of going

48
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,480
from idea making some basic like ideas

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,330
of who would use this make mock-ups and

50
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,390
then Dida code and also look at you know

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,930
like oh how are how was other software

52
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,700
solving this problem that should be easy

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,590
but I did a mistake of talking to my

54
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,260
girlfriend about it and she is born and

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:59,190
raised in Radiator in Brazil and we

56
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,040
talked about public relations in general

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,170
and they turned out that we had very

58
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,670
different experiences and expectations

59
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,390
of how one would use public

60
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,060
transportation in general so it seems

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,780
like I actually had a a blank spot here

62
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,860
I I mean I knew how I use public

63
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,930
presentation but I actually don't know

64
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,360
how others use public transportation say

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,030
at a problem so I was ok how do i how do

66
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,209
I solve this how do we address this this

67
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,070
problem of a great black hole over here

68
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,780
I had read a little bit of literature

69
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,459
before about do you use a research but I

70
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,250
was always a bit afraid of it I was

71
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,070
always a bit intimidated by it I felt

72
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,510
like well if I would do this I would

73
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,090
probably do it wrong right because I I

74
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,820
don't I wouldn't ask the right questions

75
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,560
and I would just screw up the data and

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,209
it would just be terrible at this but I

77
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,220
should I should probably just try it

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,659
once we're all right and

79
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,579
even if I do it with just a couple

80
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,680
people I don't have a sample group or

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,649
100 or something like that at least that

82
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,780
I get to talk to at least a couple other

83
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,810
people then then that would be better

84
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,270
than just basing the data on one person

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,340
so I called up some friends and family

86
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,560
from different parts of Sweden and I

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,210
called some people in Brazil and I just

88
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,520
asked them some some very simple

89
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,560
questions and these were all like my

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,930
friends and family so I totally

91
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,849
understood that okay yeah this is not

92
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,820
the best selection of people necessarily

93
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,979
but this is what I have right these are

94
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:04,639
the people that I had access to you so I

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,130
asked them these Mario's of the question

96
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,009
I mean the top one as they talk about

97
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,430
the MIR earlier talk is a total closed

98
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,880
questions but the other ones I tried to

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,000
make fairly open so for example the top

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,909
one is ID on the car which is a question

101
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,330
is are you only dependent on public

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,650
transportation when you get somewhere

103
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,599
like intensity of usage what happens a

104
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,639
website to use today which is a good way

105
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,770
of figuring out okay what other kind of

106
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,960
software can I look at so I got a lot of

107
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,159
tips on different types people used what

108
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,169
they disliked about those particular

109
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,750
applications and what they liked about

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,449
those one was regarding the value

111
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,759
shorter travel time or less switches

112
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,580
which is a real question right and some

113
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,539
people struggled with that but that was

114
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,430
also in order to figure out like Oh a

115
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,740
sorting algorithm for the different

116
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,419
results and walk in between the stops

117
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,009
also sorting out a new thing do you

118
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,590
prefer certainly no transportation

119
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,930
like to ride trains more maybe you like

120
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,830
to ride buses maybe and also that of

121
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,320
course it worked about to arrive at the

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,300
departure like when that is important to

123
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,440
you yeah so I just call up these people

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
it was fairly short interviews maybe

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,360
like 10-15 minutes tops and yeah this

126
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,490
asked them these basic questions and and

127
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,230
it was quite good because like once you

128
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,180
got I'm talking like they were happy to

129
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,630
share a lot of their general experience

130
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,490
around these and they were telling like

131
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,070
oh I go from home when I go like 80

132
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,580
strips everyday and I have these channel

133
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,520
this when I'm doing their strokes and

134
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,950
with the verbs - I asked one of my

135
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,440
friends asked well they prefer a certain

136
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,470
mean of Transportation and she answered

137
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,110
like well I don't prefer is that so much

138
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,140
that I simply cannot take buses it

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,630
doesn't work for me because I get really

140
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,330
carsick even though like anyway like I

141
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,520
have to take the trams and I was like

142
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,740
well how carsick do yet and she was like

143
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,110
well I guess so carsick that I I just

144
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,530
faint so this doesn't work for me right

145
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,570
so suddenly it occurred to me that this

146
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,850
wasn't so much of a preference as like

147
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,160
it's such a basic need for her to be

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,610
able to sort out yeah in this case buses

149
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,010
because yeah did any any kind of results

150
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,780
with buses would just be useless for her

151
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,030
it would just clutter up the the whole

152
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,560
interface so that was revealing and I

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,770
learned other things as well in a

154
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,950
similar vein see what I did once I had

155
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,350
talked to these people people like all

156
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,740
the research I put them out on our wiki

157
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,380
take no Mackay and and shared it with

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:29,170
Marcus again the developer and then I

159
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,580
tried to summarize the data and I did

160
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,220
this in the form of a person as then and

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,320
all of these

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,780
you can see like they are their combined

163
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,929
combinations of up data that I got out

164
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,710
of the the interviews all right so

165
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,490
here's one of them this is Jenny it's a

166
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,410
little bit of like just background which

167
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,970
is that okay she's new in the city right

168
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,820
she can't find her way around and then

169
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,210
like a smaller Astoria for her and a

170
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,220
specific scenario that she needs to

171
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,560
carry out like a better person would

172
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,700
need to carry out with this center UI

173
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,740
[Music]

174
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,030
she get carsick spare you see

175
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,130
so she yeah once to avoid to go by bus

176
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,030
and that I lifted directly from this

177
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,360
friend of mine and the friend that

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,980
mentioned the car sickness she was not

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,300
the only one that also happened to

180
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,390
another person but she she was the one

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,990
that had had it most severe alright and

182
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,430
after that was done then like I said

183
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,620
like yeah this is telephone yeah these

184
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
things they make sense

185
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,590
I don't want an implemented DUI and or I

186
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:54,570
did their wireframes right and yeah and

187
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,960
then I guy I basically used the things

188
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,420
that I learned so it has this simple

189
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,890
little family you can can sort out

190
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,080
certainly some frustration for example

191
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,150
if you get very carsick rights adapted

192
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,280
matches the general personnel you get

193
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:22,770
results here and at the beginning I if I

194
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,420
had done it like without doing these

195
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,490
interviews I would not have included the

196
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,680
numbers on the buses here because I was

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,960
like are you just going and she should

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,460
have clutter about too much to you why

199
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,750
right but I figured that a lot of people

200
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,770
are actually they know their city that

201
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,840
well that they know like oh I know where

202
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,890
I can find traveler rates and I know how

203
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,450
to get between the end station

204
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,360
that too number fever I know where I

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,880
need to switch and also the the move now

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,260
is the the defaults and it has a drop

207
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,120
down for arrived by because it made made

208
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,220
sense as a default alright yeah I talked

209
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,320
again to Michael's a very important

210
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,060
thing I feel in general is that the

211
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,070
designer and the developer needs to have

212
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,300
a constant collaboration it can't be

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,820
that you you drop this perfect thing and

214
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,950
then you hand it off and then you back

215
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,600
away right that's not my style

216
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,420
one station was in fairly a good shape

217
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,260
I checked out the branch and then I

218
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,650
invited some people over to just do some

219
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,570
very basic usability testing on on this

220
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,420
UI and and they wanted to try if I could

221
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:02,230
carry out these these actions I did this

222
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,500
over like maybe I did like person every

223
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,300
other day or something five people in

224
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,190
total and as we found issues I reported

225
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,320
them from my kids and he was able to fix

226
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
them before the next person would try it

227
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,950
out so the people would have run into

228
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,910
the same things over and over again yeah

229
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,890
that's the whole thing wasn't just so

230
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,480
funny and Marcus but it was actually

231
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,210
built like oh by all these people who

232
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,310
was kind enough to offer that time to

233
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,890
need the interviews and also the people

234
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,870
who were kind enough to help with the

235
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,960
usability testing so yeah I guess in the

236
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,610
end there were quite a bunch of people

237
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,860
who were involved in in building this

238
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,700
interface and yeah I think that's it for

239
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,770
me if you have feedback about this talk

240
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,970
good or bad

241
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,269
just go to this URL and submit some

242
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:46,610
feedback and that's it for me I assume

243
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,750
so I'm going to repeat for the camera so

244
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,319
the question is since I only since my

245
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:59,269
sample is only six people it could be

246
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,009
the issue of that for something with car

247
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,470
sickness that it's it's I actually

248
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,949
happened to run into the one person that

249
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,769
passed is like very weird because I'm

250
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,149
not saying that cars think is there one

251
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,699
of them but it could be that you you you

252
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,639
get very skewed data because the sample

253
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,970
is so small right yeah and I think that

254
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,430
is so true but at the same time I think

255
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,939
it's better if you go out and at least

256
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:31,970
get some data and at the same time being

257
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,889
aware that okay I will talk to six

258
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,649
people could be totally off but at least

259
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,829
I spoke to six people about it you know

260
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:45,500
and then hopefully this is not a dumb

261
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,059
thing of course I would love to you

262
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,740
interview more people I think also debts

263
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,839
yeah since these things take a bit of

264
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,279
time right it took me like at least

265
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,040
fifteen minutes for each person and then

266
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,540
I also had to talk to them a little bit

267
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,170
for and so maybe it's 2025 minutes in

268
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,470
total

269
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,360
it takes a little it takes a lot of time

270
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,750
right so ideally

271
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,420
I as a designer and the team should not

272
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,250
be the only one that does this but

273
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,180
ideally also other people could help out

274
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,250
with this the developers could also be

275
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,840
involved in doing the interviews or in

276
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,810
in doing the usability testing because

277
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,400
then you're suddenly you have to

278
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,310
multiply very easily

279
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,870
touring code implementation in the sense

280
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,420
that Michaels had done a a branch where

281
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,290
the basic functionality was there not

282
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,750
everything not all the details were were

283
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,000
in their final state but it was good

284
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,300
enough that it was functional enough

285
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,740
that people could actually start using

286
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,950
it and then that's where we started

287
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,410
doing the whole thing and we picked up

288
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,040
on very specific things which would be

289
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,520
hard to find otherwise like it had

290
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,890
certain focus issues which we had to

291
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,589
work out which is just like it's such an

292
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:26,910
embarrassment when you sit there and

293
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,380
taking notes and you're like ah the

294
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,390
focus okay and and also in the

295
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,140
sense that people use the map itself and

296
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,360
that's a wash the sidebar I can show

297
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,080
here they would like right click on the

298
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,880
mouth and like the different action

299
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
there which was also something I had

300
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,930
missed completely so that's also

301
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,410
something we we did because then yeah we

302
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,520
if we had gone on to a weird path it

303
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,700
would not have been like you know 35

304
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,699
coding hours invested in that for

305
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,819
nothing

306
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,069
this all is I have at least five minutes

307
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:26,619
I can I can give a little demo let's see

308
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,230
how do I get the mouse on the right

309
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,590
screen this is great

310
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,990
alright so I want to get from you a b20

311
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,169
I'm just gonna butcher it if I say wrong

312
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,040
is it connected properly its typing a

313
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,250
little bit of searching unfortunately

314
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,960
alright so from here and then it was

315
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,330
there once

316
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,910
Wow what's up with that

317
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:22,240
it is not a master yet he be alright and

318
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,500
yeah here we get the results

319
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:33,549
well it's broken I'm so sorry I should

320
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,200
have I should have recorded the whole

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,500
thing right okay you get the difference

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,440
assaults okay if I select to go with

323
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,700
numbers 25 oh yeah I get the stations in

324
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,799
between which is an expanded a little

325
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,929
thing which is good if I'm here in the

326
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,730
city because I need to only watches the

327
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,410
station before the station I need to get

328
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,590
off right and I also get walking

329
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,380
instructions for how to get from the

330
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,679
summary to the street and then be a

331
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,020
rival time and then I can go back I can

332
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,260
choose the different to

333
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,840
throughout Paris they wouldn't go any

334
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,040
faster but in some cities yeah so that's

335
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,870
it I can also load later infinitives

336
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,270
okay I think that's it 7:45 oh yeah

337
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:35,910
that's how it works from a product

338
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,600
called

339
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,390
silica she was where do I get the data

340
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,010
there is a product called open trip

341
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,910
planner which is a open source project

342
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,679
and there is a couple of cities that

343
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,059
pass their data in this kind of formats

344
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,380
we currently have a test server up and

345
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,990
running we need a proper survey which we

346
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,600
would host ourselves we haven't solved

347
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:09,480
that yet so good I think and I'm out of

348
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,750
time

349
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,709
