1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,350
all right so this lightning talk was

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,389
originally scheduled to be presented by

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,580
dodgy but he took a week vacation and

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,019
he's off skiing in the French Alps right

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,390
now so he think me last week and said

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,939
hey I need you to do this for me so be

7
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,750
the nice guy I am I said sure well he

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,720
reports to somebody the reports to me so

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,360
how he's gonna get it anyways no not at

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,860
all not at all don't get a great guy so

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,470
my name is Patrick McDonald I'm a

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,329
director of engineering at Red Hat and I

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,219
work out of the Toronto Ontario right

14
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,850
height engineering office so I'll spend

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,710
a few minutes but we're going old-school

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,050
there's no slides okay I know that

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,370
wasn't totally in the old school because

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,780
I have a computer in front of me so I'm

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,600
not doing a fun notebook but so a few

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,400
minutes talking about LLVM s current

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,350
state at Red Hat where it fits and what

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,480
it's used for now what I'm talking about

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,510
LLVM in this context it's the C and C++

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,100
ecosystem all right so when I say LLVM

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,019
and the talk I really mean the C and C++

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,520
side of it so today at Red Hat we we

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,770
view the compiler landscape as I can a

28
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,920
to compiler ecosystem we have GCC on one

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,590
side and we have LLVM on the other side

30
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,990
now both have excellent and vibrant

31
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,420
communities to a strong leadership and

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,690
progressive directions so the both

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,520
communities are extremely strong which

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,080
is just best for everyone now it can't

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,030
understand you can't understand the LLVM

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,950
side until you understand it's a little

37
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,159
bit about the GCC side so GCC continues

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,479
to be the core of Red Hat Enterprise

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,610
Linux in the portfolio that is built

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,830
upon that platform it's our system

41
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,170
compiler so we have a significant number

42
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,229
of global engineers that work in the GCC

43
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,880
communities such as you know the

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,650
compiler side the library the debugger

45
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,619
as well as several key maintainer zhan

46
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,240
staff so that's the the GCC side the

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,590
more interesting side for this

48
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,439
particular venue is the L of the inside

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,549
so LLVM has been in fedora for quite

50
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,349
some time since Fedora 21 we're

51
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:12,760
twenty-five now so we're talking a

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,919
couple years but even prior to that it

53
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,860
was eople which is extra packages for

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Enterprise Linux so we're not new to the

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,350
LLVM game so we've been there for a

56
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,530
while now what we see internally is a

57
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,780
growing twin a trend towards increasing

58
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,270
number of packages that have build or

59
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,300
runtime dependencies on LLVM you know

60
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,120
packages such as dotnet and that's open

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,550
source at its best right projects should

62
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,990
have the freedom to choose the best

63
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,000
tools for their requirements you

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
shouldn't have to be forced to use

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,300
certain tools so what do we do

66
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,420
internally where do we use LLVM so we're

67
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,820
using LLVM for internal use by our

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,890
developers to support the building of

69
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,990
packages internally as well as

70
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,610
investigating functionalities such as

71
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,280
the the analyzers let's say so we

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,410
closely monitor the developer's needs

73
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,720
engage interest in formulate direction

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,390
upon that so to facilitate the

75
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,040
development and support of the internal

76
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,730
build tools

77
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,760
Red Hat has hired and is hiring

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,350
developers from the LLVM community so

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,959
we're staffing in mind at Tom stellar

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,930
joins Red Hat on Monday as technical

81
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,480
lead for our LLVM development team and

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,280
he will help drive our direction he is

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,700
yeah yep so that was my next line tom is

84
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,590
the upstream I love the unstable branch

85
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,180
manager so he's still gonna be doing

86
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,610
that so he should be known to someone in

87
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,100
the community already all right so while

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,780
the team at Red Hat is focused on

89
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,510
internal tooling requirements we expect

90
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,489
to have a larger presence in the LLVM

91
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,910
communities over time right to fill this

92
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,830
increased presence we expect to have

93
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,890
further vacancies within this year so

94
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,410
how we staff it right hat well we

95
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,910
recruit developers through the community

96
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,250
right such as you guys right we follow

97
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,870
community closely with mailing list

98
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,959
contributions conferences as always our

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,550
job postings are a red hat jobs at Red

100
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,580
Hat comm and we're hoping to contribute

101
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
more directly to the LLVM projects

102
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,930
upstream in the spirit of open source

103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,180
software which is the the core of Red

104
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,600
Hat so thanks for having us here and for

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,729
listening to this lightning talk I hope

106
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,470
you have a better understanding of the

107
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,009
current state of LLVM at

108
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,400
not for those with questions comments or

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,809
concerns I'll be in the room for a while

110
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,669
and thank you very much and enjoy the

111
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:38,910
rest of your day

112
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,739
[Applause]
