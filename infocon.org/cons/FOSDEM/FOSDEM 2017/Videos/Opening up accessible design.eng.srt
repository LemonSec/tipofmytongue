1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,690
so

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:23,560
we have come hi everyone um I like Leona

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,180
I'm also going to be touching on

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,240
accessibility in this case these posters

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,910
that I've designed called the do's and

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,719
don'ts on designing for accessibility

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,899
and how by sharing them and keeping them

8
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,699
open-source they've led to some pretty

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,010
exciting and unexpected things so none

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,350
of these posters would have been

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,420
realized how did nothing for this one

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,109
visual that came to my head which was

13
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:56,649
this which I'll explain in a bit so

14
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,120
right now I'm just going to give you a

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,429
bit of background as to what I do and

16
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,889
where I work as this helps shape the

17
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:08,020
posters and how I've made them so I'm an

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,119
interaction designer at the home office

19
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,799
which is a UK government department

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,509
that's responsible for things like

21
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:16,329
security immigration and law enforcement

22
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,850
and while there are aspects of the Home

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,270
Office they tend to be quite closed

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,280
locked down and confidential such as

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,240
looking into tackling terrorism what we

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,640
do in my team which is digital data and

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,880
technology is to work in transparent

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,539
agile ways we deliver services such as

29
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,299
renewing a passport and applying for a

30
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,429
visa and the way we work involves lots

31
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:44,890
of user research prototyping services

32
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,869
that could be tested with users

33
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,359
iterating on them based on feedback so

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,829
that we could produce something that

35
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,780
truly meets our user needs and they're

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,659
always working our based on these design

37
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,369
principles set forth by the government

38
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,549
digital service or GDS which helps other

39
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,259
government departments meet user needs

40
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,038
and transform digital services the two

41
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,360
points that I'd like tour the two

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,650
principles that I'd like to highlight

43
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,290
are number six which is this is for

44
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,140
everyone because what we design needs to

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,010
be something that

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,629
everyone can use regardless of their

47
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:23,200
ability or the type of technology and

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,019
the chance makes things open it makes

49
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,150
things better what we mean by that is to

50
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,510
be able to share design share code share

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,189
ideas even share failures or mistakes

52
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,290
because things get pointed out

53
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,599
suggestions get made and the thing that

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,829
you're sharing gets improved so what

55
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,190
does this mean about the posters or what

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,970
does it mean with regards to the posters

57
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,440
I'm part of them an in-house

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,930
accessibility or access needs team

59
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,209
composed of about 14 user researchers

60
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,230
and designers who focus on these broad

61
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,760
areas autism in ADHD motor disabilities

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,709
mental health dyslexia visual

63
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,879
impairments and deafness and

64
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,889
hard-of-hearing and each member of our

65
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,650
team is paired up in order to take on a

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,329
broad condition and research it

67
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,629
extensively and that could be through

68
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,280
conducting personal interviews with

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,790
users undergoing training and our role

70
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,910
is to pool our knowledge together so we

71
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,379
can get a greater understanding as a

72
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,560
whole feedback into each other's

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,019
knowledge on the respective conditions

74
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,690
as a team we've done talks we've

75
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,819
participated in deaf awareness training

76
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,489
and we've also had these breakout

77
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,519
sessions during our away day our home

78
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,620
office away day where we've invited

79
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,989
people to try out simulation tools like

80
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,030
simulation goggles and simulation gloves

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,829
to see what it feels like to you to to

82
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,319
be like certain users that have certain

83
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,970
conditions in order to empathize and

84
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,620
increase greater understanding of

85
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,340
different users in our society and so my

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,090
focus is on autism and H ADHD with

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,730
another colleague Nick Wineman and one

88
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,430
of the things I've learned about autism

89
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,019
was this can anyone tell me what this is

90
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,548
yes so so it's raining cats and dogs

91
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,010
it's it's an old English phrase that

92
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,840
indicates heavy rain torrential

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,710
downpours but for someone with autism

94
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,650
this can be taken literally and it's

95
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,990
because of the the careful attention to

96
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,570
detail of the structural language that

97
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,580
makes it really hard to comprehend

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,470
figurative figures of speech and

99
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,860
figurative language so with this in mind

100
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,199
and this visual became the basis of a

101
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,900
poster I created called designing for

102
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,070
users on the autistic spectrum and the

103
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,830
first guidance guiding principle I put

104
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,080
on the poster was don't use figures of

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110
speech or idioms instead write in plain

106
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,479
language it's clear and much more easier

107
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,020
to understand and I then started to roll

108
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,789
out a few more design principles that

109
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,740
I've researched with regards to

110
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,270
designing for users on the spectrum and

111
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,280
I just want to highlight that good

112
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,410
design principles apply to everyone and

113
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,110
it's just the aim of these posters is to

114
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,960
highlight certain design principles that

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,789
will impact certain users more than

116
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,030
others so it's it's it's promoting

117
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,979
awareness of different users in our

118
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,320
society and different conditions in

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,900
order through good design practice and

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,810
the autism poster became the catalyst

121
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,250
for rolling out a series of other

122
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,710
posters I'm now going to go through some

123
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,560
of the key elements in each of them

124
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,020
which were provided to me by the rest of

125
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,960
my access needs team who has done a lot

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,349
of great research pretty much without

127
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,520
without their feedback and their their

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
insight and their knowledge these

129
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,630
posters wouldn't have have happened at

130
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:03,960
all

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,610
so just to go through some of them

132
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,400
briefly designing for users of screen

133
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,820
readers do structure content using html5

134
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,150
make sure it's correctly marked up don't

135
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,430
rely on making things big and bold to

136
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,960
convey that it's something like a header

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
because screen readers won't read that

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,699
properly use a combination of color

139
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,970
shape and text in order to convey that

140
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,729
something is a button for example as

141
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,199
opposed to just using color alone

142
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
because some some people may not be able

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
to distinguish colors and we're still is

144
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,900
if those colors tend to be quite similar

145
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,680
in hues use images and diagrams to

146
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,030
support text on this

147
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,390
breaks up lots of heavy text and it

148
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,750
increased cognition and for some

149
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,000
dyslexic seeing a lot of text can cause

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,070
what's known as like a blurry or swirly

151
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,750
effect it the text moves so designed for

152
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,970
keyboard or speech only use not everyone

153
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,190
uses a mouse make sure that all

154
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,580
functionality is available on a keyboard

155
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,960
and for those that do use a mouse

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
consider not making dynamic content that

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,640
requires a lot of precise mouse

158
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
movements so for example hiding things

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
in sub menus and submenus

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,670
that have small click or hit areas use

161
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,470
subtitles or transcripts for videos this

162
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,930
provides additional content or

163
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,540
additional information as opposed to

164
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,790
putting content in just audio or video

165
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,510
only so this is the set of posters that

166
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,710
we have at the moment oh sorry

167
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,910
designing for users on the autistic

168
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,530
spectrum designing for users of screen

169
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,800
readers users with low vision those with

170
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,350
dyslexia physical or motor disabilities

171
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,700
and those who are deaf or hard of

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,370
hearing so now I'm going to tell you

173
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,930
about how sharing these posters with the

174
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,910
community makes it better I mean it's

175
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,290
it's at the heart of what we do at the

176
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,360
Home Office and it's one of the guiding

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,190
design principles and why I'm here

178
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,460
in this open source conference so we

179
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,560
shared this on the government

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,750
accessibility blog we've also shared

181
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,510
this on Twitter and on github and we've

182
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,330
had an amazing response we've had a few

183
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,880
write-ups and some great mentions from

184
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,100
the community one of the really great

185
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,280
things that have come out of out of this

186
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,039
sharing the posters was that we've had

187
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,539
some suggestions for creating new

188
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,990
posters such as this one from a user who

189
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,480
would like to see a poster on divine for

190
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,200
those who use voice recognition software

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,950
and then we've also had users this this

192
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,460
user is on the spectrum but she had

193
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,250
suggested just additional design

194
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,499
principles that would apply

195
00:08:58,499 --> 00:08:59,879
not just to one poster but across

196
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,599
several so for her it was to give users

197
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:07,469
a chance to control the play the of

198
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,689
audio or video that's on a page as

199
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,909
opposed to having it automatically play

200
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,979
because for her she was quite sensitive

201
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,499
to sound and having there's nothing

202
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:19,169
worse than clicking on an unsuspecting

203
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,239
link and then having this sudden noise

204
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,809
you know come at you and this is also a

205
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,909
problem for someone using a screen

206
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,409
reader because of the overlapping of

207
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,569
sounds and for someone with motor

208
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,339
disabilities having to track down the

209
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,349
source of the sound in order to stop it

210
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,329
especially if the controls are quite

211
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,789
small in finicky or are hidden

212
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:43,109
altogether so one of the really great

213
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:45,749
things that has come out as well from

214
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:48,179
sharing was we've had questions about

215
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,429
why certain design principles or certain

216
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,699
ways so this one was taken from the deaf

217
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,859
and hard-of-hearing poster we say don't

218
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,839
use complicated words but then the

219
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,909
question is why and this is where we

220
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,379
need to iterate on these posters because

221
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,629
we've provided guidance that was too

222
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,059
broad but without proper context or

223
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,299
additional explanations so we say don't

224
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,309
use complicated words not that deaf

225
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,319
users won't be able to understand

226
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,229
complicated words it's just that deaf

227
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,999
users have different methods of

228
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,129
communication and that's that could be

229
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:21,859
lip-reading or that could be signing and

230
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:24,899
when you lip read complicated words I

231
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,029
mean it's already a challenge enough as

232
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,579
it is to to be able to read someone's

233
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,970
lips but and to be complicated words

234
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,659
would be even more challenging also with

235
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,329
signing assigning has its own structure

236
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:41,399
and syntax that is very different from

237
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,279
the spoken language so it's just best to

238
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,049
avoid using complicated language

239
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:48,239
altogether and be able to sign with

240
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:52,859
simple and more concise words so we

241
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,419
talked about accessibility in the

242
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,279
posters but what about making these

243
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,609
posters accessible themselves and what

244
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,379
we found out was when I produce these

245
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,379
posters I've produced them as PDFs but

246
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,099
we soon found out that these PDS aren't

247
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,079
properly tagged for screen readers to

248
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,100
read

249
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,330
so this is something that we're

250
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,360
currently working on we're having one of

251
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,180
our design interns Megan looking into

252
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,640
tagging these properly and she's she's

253
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,200
been learning along the way because

254
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,450
she's never come across a screen reader

255
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,450
she's attended usability sessions in

256
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,250
order to gain better understanding of

257
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,740
how screen readers work and how it

258
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,010
applies to what she's trying to do so

259
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,810
another way of making these posters

260
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,550
accessible is offering them up to be

261
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,920
translated so they can be accessible in

262
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
other languages and so far currently in

263
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,320
our github repo we have five different

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,290
translations and there's a sixth that's

265
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,560
coming along so we have translations in

266
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,120
German Spanish French Chinese Dutch and

267
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,180
we're reviewing Turkish at the moment so

268
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,890
we've learned a lot of things as we've

269
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,710
offered these up for translations one of

270
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,540
the things was that when I had initially

271
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,310
created these posters I've created them

272
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,650
in sketch which is a Mac based vector

273
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,710
software when everyone has sketch and

274
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,290
not everyone uses a Mac so we reached

275
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,120
out to the github community to ask what

276
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,340
was the best format to share these in so

277
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,620
that anyone can use this and open it up

278
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,140
in their respective graphic software and

279
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,110
we found that SVG scalable vector

280
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,330
graphics were probably the best bet

281
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,270
some people can modify PDFs as well so

282
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,520
we've provided on our github repo a

283
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,730
sketch for PDFs and SVG's we've also

284
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,620
learned that we needed to put a Creative

285
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,560
Commons license logo because there were

286
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,840
some people who who felt a bit nervous

287
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,140
about taking the posters and translating

288
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,730
them changing them if there were

289
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,250
copyright issues so we needed to make it

290
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,470
clear where we stood and we actively

291
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,870
encouraged you know people to translate

292
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,820
these posters so we put this Creative

293
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,500
Commons Licence logo on the footer and

294
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,660
had asked everyone that if they wanted

295
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,200
to translate the posters they they need

296
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,270
to include this logo and have it

297
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,030
attributed to the source which is a home

298
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,580
office and then they are free to to

299
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,890
modify these and it just gives people a

300
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,999
peace of mind to be able to

301
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,459
modify the posters and freely distribute

302
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,480
them we've also had some users that

303
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,209
wanted to translate them we had multiple

304
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,889
users wanting to translate them in the

305
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,989
same language so what we did there was

306
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,999
we encouraged the collaboration instead

307
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,879
of individual users providing the same

308
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,209
type of translations we've we've we've

309
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,040
had such a great success with it we've

310
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,559
had people being able to work based upon

311
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,689
you know like there were some

312
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:56,600
translations where it was you know is it

313
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,759
you use familial or formal phrasing and

314
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,529
it was just being able to have have

315
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,019
users collaborate on those on these

316
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,540
translations which makes them so great

317
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,779
and finally um I just want to share this

318
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,529
really super handy get browser site that

319
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,779
was made by one of the designers in

320
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,939
government digital service Joe lemon

321
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,029
it's an alternative to accessing these

322
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,850
posters on github what he's done was

323
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,779
made it as a more visual way of being

324
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,239
able to access them and I'll show the

325
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,569
links to where you can get these posters

326
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,239
on our github and on git browser later

327
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:41,889
on so what's next

328
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,319
this is quite exciting we have on two of

329
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,079
our design interns Megan and Simon

330
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,689
looking to code the or build these in

331
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,980
HTML and by building it in HTML it will

332
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,319
be made even more available for even a

333
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,769
wider number of users they're building

334
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,350
it responsive in two ways

335
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,850
responsive in terms of layout so that

336
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,679
users can view these posters in whatever

337
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:10,309
device they like mobile tablet desktop

338
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,769
but it's also responsive because they're

339
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:16,220
taking in the feedback the suggestions

340
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,389
that we've had we've had gathered from

341
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,189
sharing these posters in the first place

342
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,970
and find ways of scaling these posters

343
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,889
up so that they can so you can add

344
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,100
additional design principles and there's

345
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,199
there's a they're looking into a view

346
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,059
more link so you can provide additional

347
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,810
content

348
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,670
it's an additional information for some

349
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,140
of these design principles so that

350
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,180
they're not too broad and and make you

351
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,100
think like well why why are you advising

352
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,230
this for these for certain users and not

353
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,840
others and it's also they're also

354
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,820
looking that challenge that they have is

355
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,810
looking at things like you know do they

356
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,570
do they layout the do's and don'ts side

357
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,390
by side as it is in the posters or do

358
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,400
they perhaps look at focusing on all the

359
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,250
all the good design practices and then

360
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,070
the and those that are best to avoid do

361
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,200
they make the do section a fixed header

362
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,300
so as you scroll through let's say on a

363
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,670
mobile you can get all this great like

364
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,870
design principles and and you don't have

365
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,200
to be constantly reiterating do this do

366
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,070
this do this so so they have yeah quite

367
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,170
quite a few challenges and they're quite

368
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,690
a few things to think about from a

369
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,880
visual and also from a cognitive point

370
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,220
of view but they would love to hear from

371
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,130
you so if you have any questions if you

372
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,020
have any suggestions or feedback about

373
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,240
how they could build this please feel

374
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,750
free to send them an email or just to

375
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,320
say hi and here are the links to the

376
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,730
posters on github and on git browser and

377
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,770
for more information about what we do at

378
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,960
the home office this is an email to our

379
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,670
access needs team to find out more about

380
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,080
the different conditions that were

381
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,910
exploring and I just want to conclude

382
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,970
with this one tweet by a Twitter

383
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,089
follower at UX for science who had

384
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,949
printed these posters and shared them on

385
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:12,589
his walls and he said here's your

386
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,390
posters at work literally every day

387
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,699
people stand there read and discuss it's

388
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,060
just a start but a great one so we all

389
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,800
have to start somewhere for me it was a

390
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,849
visual idea that became the basis of a

391
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,550
poster which then rolled out into a

392
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,250
series of posters and by sharing them

393
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,390
with the community with a wider

394
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,429
community we were able to receive lots

395
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,920
of great feedback for iteration and we

396
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,960
had requests to translate them

397
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,840
internationally we were surprised and

398
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,370
touched that people around the world had

399
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,830
wanted to translate these posters and

400
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,690
now we have this opportunity to scale

401
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,640
this up even further by building this in

402
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,570
code and I just want to say that if it

403
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,110
wasn't for oh oh

404
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:26,099
sorry if it wasn't for sharing sharing

405
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,629
these posters and making them open we

406
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:32,940
would never have gotten these

407
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,200
opportunities and and this this amazing

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,969
feedback and it would never have given

409
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,739
me the opportunity to come to this great

410
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:43,379
global conference and be able to speak

411
00:18:43,379 --> 00:19:18,749
to you all yes so we did have we did

412
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:23,029
have questions about like cultural as

413
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:30,289
with respects to nothing pertaining to

414
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:33,409
right to left or left to right as of yet

415
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:37,919
but we we have had thank Berlin had

416
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,349
contributed to one of the posters where

417
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,299
it was a Spanish poster and it was a

418
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,049
Latin America and Spain and it was being

419
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,299
able to talk about the different I think

420
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,529
there were different idioms so instead

421
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,389
of raining cats and dogs it was a

422
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:54,389
completely different figure of speech so

423
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,879
it was it was it was being able to work

424
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,829
through what those what those

425
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,289
differences may be and what what can be

426
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,349
a compromise if there is a compromise if

427
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,119
not then it becomes something that I

428
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,749
think you know the users can try to

429
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,179
decide amongst themselves what what to

430
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,539
do next

431
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm sorry how do I measure the

432
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,250
complexity of words uh oh good question

433
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,040
that's something that maybe the other my

434
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
other access news team may be able to

435
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,100
answer as well complexity as oh sorry

436
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,220
complexity as um for example if you're

437
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,679
if you're using a lot of different words

438
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,270
to describe something that may be able

439
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,820
to be summed up in one word or to two

440
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,890
words so not not like you using using

441
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,940
simple words to represent a multiple

442
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,820
number of words perhaps or maybe not

443
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,620
using jargon if it's something is quite

444
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,630
technical if there's a way that you can

445
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,650
use it in plain language

446
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:59,430
oh and I just want to find like last

447
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,370
point well said um I have a few sets of

448
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,590
the posters with me I know you can

449
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,630
access em on github in your browser but

450
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,700
if anyone is willing to volunteer a new

451
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,140
translation that's not in our github

452
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,040
repo please see me at later on and I'll

453
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,570
give you a free poster so thank you

454
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,939
[Applause]
