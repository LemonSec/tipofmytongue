1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,129
I'm going to talk about haiku another

2
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:17,680
retro desktop well turned off here well

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
it's yeah it's inspired by retro stuff

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,260
actually because it's now vintage soon

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:30,270
yeah and so welcome yes I'm the user and

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,780
developer for haiku and I think there

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,679
are still some interesting bits to to

8
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:44,019
copy from us we are sharing so what's

9
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,429
what's haiku haiku is a free software

10
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:51,729
operating system so it's inspired by the

11
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,909
be us that most of you don't know what

12
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:59,709
is that it was a proprietary operating

13
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:07,000
system up to the like 2001 until the

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,030
company shut down people try to maintain

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,310
it but it didn't work out and despite

16
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,710
the fact that it was proprietary some of

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,950
us used it and we thought it had

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,590
interesting ideas so which is so let's

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,710
rewrite it as free software so you won't

20
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,200
be able to disappear anymore so

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,530
basically haiku is to be Res what

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,580
gnu/linux is to UNIX and what react OS

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,200
is two windows if you don't know about

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,370
writers we use our own kernel and our

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,300
own graphics server so it's interesting

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,640
because we control the whole stack so if

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,990
there's something we need from the

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,450
kernel we don't have to call the

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,620
leanness and ask please add this Cisco

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,280
we just catch it and that's it on the

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
other hand it means well quoting stuff

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,019
from gnu/linux that uses x11 it's a bit

33
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:10,080
harder

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,040
especially because well some Linux devs

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,100
they when the gate patches for haiku

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,080
they complain oh but that's not that's

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,580
not POSIX whatever even though we do

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,240
have we do add proper configure

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
detection of the feature and whatever

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,600
but then they just don't forget that

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,770
they also use private well Linux only

42
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,380
Cisco's that's Aaron's POSIX either but

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,500
well they are Linux they don't care and

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,230
also we have a C++ API that has some

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,480
interesting consequences like the fact

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,820
that we have to still use GCC to to

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,040
compile the base system but we also

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,700
support GCC five it's six now I think

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,900
all right so yeah so that's what we were

50
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,170
inspired by that's an old screenshot of

51
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,690
the US and oh look there's a doc but

52
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,940
what you got change to the desk bar

53
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,120
later on but yeah dogs are naturally new

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,810
sorry so that's just to give you an idea

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,180
of the Haiku in heritage so bureaus

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,010
world stuff from UNIX from Mac OS

57
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,380
because it was created by an X Apple CEO

58
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,640
about Europe Co so yeah and so I said we

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,480
I said we use our own kernel we actually

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,730
fork the new OS kernel which was written

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,590
by annex B Inc engineer who was

62
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,760
frustrated because it couldn't work on

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,580
the US colonel so it just said oh let's

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,130
write my own camera and we fought it and

65
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,690
now it's our own version so you might

66
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,340
think okay this looks like 1990s stuff

67
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,870
to me most of us don't really fancy

68
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,540
stuff like wow animations and stuff like

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,149
that yeah I mean any animations are cool

70
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,640
but when you are in Mac OS and you're

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,380
trying to switch from one space to

72
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,610
another

73
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,229
you have to wait for the thing to move

74
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,469
and you you if you hit the shortcut too

75
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:34,680
many times it just goes oh I'm sick so

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,629
yeah we prefer just to have the thing

77
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,210
work and it's faster this way and

78
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,629
there's much more to it of course we've

79
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,939
added some new stuff in haiku that

80
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,409
weren't very current standards at the

81
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:52,409
u.s. time like layout supports which was

82
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,189
necessary then for the translation

83
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,960
because some strings are not the same

84
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,949
with in different languages spanic works

85
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,050
quite well now some applications still

86
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,830
need to be brought it to this API but

87
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,650
most actually work this way the the

88
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,669
design of our graphic server and

89
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,240
interface kit which is our own toolkit

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
it's a bit weird because we use threads

91
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,379
everywhere maybe a bit too much for some

92
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,219
people app server which actually is the

93
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:34,589
graphic server suppose a thread per

94
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:37,139
window to handle the repainting and

95
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,419
stuff like that and the application

96
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,289
itself

97
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,789
also has several so-called bloopers

98
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:46,050
object which actually is from their own

99
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,810
thread so the main thread is taken over

100
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,060
by the B application object which runs

101
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,430
the messaging loop for the the whole

102
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,279
application so like messages like hey

103
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,550
let's quit or whatever or you've got a

104
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,370
new file to open or something and also

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,900
every time you create a new window

106
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
well we create a new thread to handle

107
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,379
the the Windows messaging itself like

108
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,659
unitary panes it has been resized

109
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,139
whatever

110
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,200
this means that when a winner is stuck

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,780
calculating well if the window is start

112
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,090
calculating something the whole

113
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,160
application won't freeze just because of

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
it

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,780
usually we separate large calculation in

116
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,510
yet another threat but like video

117
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,570
decoding VLC does that it has a lot of

118
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,480
threat even on other platforms but if

119
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,160
you look at most applications on

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,760
gnu/linux it's basically the main main

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,180
thread which is a loop on select which

122
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,680
works but well it just C realizes that

123
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,270
so it's good for responsiveness but on

124
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,730
the other hand when we have to put Linux

125
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,520
ish applications we have to sterilize

126
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,890
back all the messages into a pipe and

127
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,560
add it to the Select loop and well it

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,770
works but it's not as good as it should

129
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,900
be but well it it just works we have

130
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,070
what we call replicants you've seen

131
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,750
plasma with earlier with widgets it's a

132
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,210
bit like this except that's one

133
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,030
application that can provide a view so

134
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,690
it's the base canvas of the toolkit to

135
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,110
another application it's not limiting to

136
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,500
limited to the desktop it can be used by

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,440
another application so for example

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,740
there's a documentation browser but it's

139
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,630
called be happy which actually used to

140
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,870
load the Net+ replicant and I fix it to

141
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,890
use the net surf replicant to display

142
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:04,030
the HTML documentation that's one thing

143
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,729
that I really miss on other systems is

144
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:12,400
called the X ray navigation so basically

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
it means you don't have to open yet

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
another window just to go down a folder

147
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,370
so well I can show you live so that's

148
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,630
just my main development virtual machine

149
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,180
in VirtualBox so it's it's a bit slow to

150
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,419
boot

151
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,479
immensely still faster than most other

152
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,289
operating systems I know

153
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:43,279
so yeah folders lots of folders so you

154
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,470
go to the desktop and then you can just

155
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,240
browse for them oh that's from a total

156
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,540
of New Year oh that was last year so

157
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,490
yeah we can press the five systems this

158
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,980
way and you can even just take one

159
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,700
folder and move it well yeah whatever

160
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:12,410
there there and yeah so so yeah give

161
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,000
this move things around without having

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,430
to open windows every time and there's

163
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,279
also moves to copy too with the same

164
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,570
same thing we have a scripting API which

165
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,420
well on Linux you have d-bus it's a bit

166
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,170
like and so we can actually the the base

167
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,420
toolkit actually understand it so you

168
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,190
can actually say eh

169
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,500
give me the title of the window or

170
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,220
similar to click on this button whatever

171
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,779
so it could be interesting like for a

172
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,709
screen reader to just get the the

173
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,740
details of the interface node monitoring

174
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,010
the tracker use it to target as the five

175
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,160
browser it uses it to see which files

176
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
have been moved and whatever so well I

177
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,910
notify is not really a new invention we

178
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,390
also have a lot of use of extended

179
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,370
attributes we just call them attributes

180
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,850
with except ours are tight so you can

181
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,740
actually say it's a string is a integer

182
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,660
a float or whatever or just binary I

183
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,170
like on Linux and most OSS it's just a

184
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,110
name and a value which is either a

185
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,740
string or binary or whatever and the

186
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,839
fact that it's type means the the file

187
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,410
system also can index it so because if

188
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,250
you want to index

189
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,190
float or as integer a string is bit

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,960
different to handle so DFS which is the

191
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,150
file system we used actually can index

192
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,150
those and make them searchable way

193
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,330
faster than having to qualifies extract

194
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,640
stuff and make database separate

195
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,770
database in the file system and it's

196
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,560
also always consistent so it's used for

197
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,480
emails contacts whatever so and it's

198
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,950
really used everywhere as I said most

199
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,370
operating systems know about extended

200
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,360
attributes but they usually have their

201
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,080
own twist about it there's an effort to

202
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,460
standardize at least on Linux that's

203
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,020
called the common extended attributes

204
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,630
standard from the free desktop website

205
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,380
it's been used like well in some places

206
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,740
but I don't really see much of usage of

207
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,890
them and well when you move files around

208
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,120
on NTFS whatever then they get mangled

209
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,170
and this results in just a blob you

210
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,510
don't know what's inside so I try to

211
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,390
propose a solution but well it seems

212
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,640
nobody care so we just do it our way we

213
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,910
also have live queries so basically the

214
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,510
colonel knows about attribute indices

215
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,130
and also queries so you can say talk to

216
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,100
the colonel and ask hey what are the

217
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,280
files that have this in the name that of

218
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,589
have been modified scenes that have the

219
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,560
male current status status equals new so

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,570
you can actually get the list of the new

221
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,550
males in the file browser so you don't

222
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,290
have to open the make line just to see

223
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,550
if you've got new made so and it's

224
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,880
updated live of course so when you view

225
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,060
males are fetched they get in the in the

226
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,730
list you can search by attribute and

227
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,880
it's endives

228
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,700
it ends up as a formula some of you

229
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,180
might have seen spotlight the search

230
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,870
stuff in Mac OS at some point you could

231
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,750
enter the formula well the the same guy

232
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,570
who wrote BFS actually wrote this stuff

233
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:20,100
in spotlight for Apple so it's not it's

234
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,010
quite similar we also have a mime

235
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,860
database like you do have an Linux

236
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,200
that's more integrated and it's also

237
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,260
useful for applications like each

238
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,260
application has its own signature so you

239
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,360
can actually do interesting things like

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,260
say open with the mime signature so

241
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,600
either it's the application itself or

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,020
one of the main types it supports so it

243
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,130
just works the same way and we also use

244
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,300
it for keyboards I think on Linux now

245
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,390
it's also used by the X paste baseball

246
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,870
or what a clipboard whatever not all

247
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,370
application really handle it correctly

248
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,670
and I've sent patches like to VirtualBox

249
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,940
to support images and not really there

250
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,570
yet at least the the x11 keyboard now

251
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,680
supports utf-8 wow that's great and

252
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,350
dragon drop as well like well well it's

253
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,840
not really easy here so well if you open

254
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,670
an image and you select a rectangle from

255
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,220
it and you just right drag it on the

256
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,200
desktop and you can get a list of the

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,500
file formats that the the application

258
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,270
can save to and then you can decide

259
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,540
which format you want and just ask the

260
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,760
application back for oh I need this mine

261
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,630
type please convert

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,990
oh and yes we we also abused it for URI

263
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,050
scheme handlers but well it also exists

264
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,070
on Linux it's just not the same prefix

265
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:20,770
but it's it also works we have our own

266
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:26,330
icon format back in the days viewers

267
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,510
used to have bitmap icons because well

268
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,970
it was just the way things were at the

269
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,180
time it was stored as in extended

270
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,580
attributes in the small section of the

271
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,470
inode because there was still some space

272
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,010
in the file system so it was just faster

273
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,520
this way and Zeta was an attempt to

274
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,610
revive the u.s. a bit later we tried to

275
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,890
because I worked there at the time we

276
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,650
try to put SVG in there but well SVG is

277
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:59,450
like it's text it's like Oh 128

278
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,870
kilobytes just for neonates bits large

279
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:09,170
even compressed and so for haiku Stefan

280
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,860
we which is one of the developers

281
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,110
designed our own icon format that's

282
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,410
simplified the coordinates for example

283
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:24,580
on 8-bit 8 bits for eggs a bit for why

284
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,990
so it's much smaller and it's still

285
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,900
vector a vector format it has gradients

286
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,140
and transparency and and the icon editor

287
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,260
I can import and export SVG so we should

288
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,120
be able to import the SVG icons from our

289
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,190
glue Linux themes for example and we now

290
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,850
have our own packaging system it's brand

291
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,510
new well it has like one or two years

292
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,890
since we actually switched to it so by

293
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,960
the way if you want to try haiku you can

294
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,410
have images on the web site for

295
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,500
VirtualBox and vmware and whatnot and

296
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,640
the eye so you can either drive bonus CD

297
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,130
and or dump it to a USB key and boot

298
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,679
from it just make sure you take a

299
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,599
nightly build not the official alpha

300
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,189
because it's like three years old and

301
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,650
doesn't have the packaging stuff so it's

302
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,010
a bit of a shame we should get a beta

303
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,799
version someday will so now we say so we

304
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,669
went a bit like the snapped stuff from

305
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:43,409
Ubuntu I won't say who copied who but

306
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,419
it's a packaged FS but is basically it's

307
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,030
a filesystem that's mounted the content

308
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,940
of the package inside the file system so

309
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,039
it's it's read-only so it's nice because

310
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,049
you make you are sure the files were not

311
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,620
modified by any other third party but

312
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,990
then some things like Python and Ruby or

313
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,510
whatever they they always want to modify

314
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,820
the file to add something as either line

315
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,260
when the package has been in solar are

316
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,490
well but we handle that any size because

317
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,530
there are transactions so when you

318
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,900
update I can show you an update there it

319
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,140
should work so that's we do have a

320
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,990
graphics application store but the

321
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,240
update isn't handled by the the degree

322
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,630
for now so yeah it just wants to update

323
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,230
it so and notice nice

324
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,360
unicode progress bar

325
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,710
yes I'll just leave it ready oh by the

326
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,300
way yeah the blue lines here just the

327
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,540
resides sides so you can actually use

328
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,910
some mud if your modifiers and move the

329
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,430
mouse to resize the window in on one

330
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,740
side without having to to to read this

331
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:13,530
part here so yeah it's updated so it has

332
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,440
some similarities with new gigs if

333
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,810
you've heard about it it's naturally the

334
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,290
same but it has some internal concepts

335
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,600
and also it's way faster it was already

336
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,420
really fast but even now way faster -

337
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,070
been so high Kubik because it only means

338
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,649
like having 200 files and that's it

339
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,030
workspaces well everyone has a virtual

340
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,470
desktop we have our own twist so each

341
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,710
window can be mapped to any and all of

342
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,690
the workspaces there's basically a

343
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,340
bitmap a 32-bit field which 1x1 bits for

344
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,310
workspace and they can have their own

345
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,830
resolution is much less useful now but

346
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,990
in the BOS days when you wanted to see

347
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,860
if Webb's websites was working in 266

348
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,390
colors you would just take the browser

349
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,640
window and switch to another workspace

350
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,100
and see oh this color is let's change it

351
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,040
and we also have a nice stack entire

352
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,770
feature which allows you to superimpose

353
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,200
windows and so have them stick together

354
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,660
with the tabs around automatically you

355
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,700
can actually slide the tabs if you want

356
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,180
just hold shift and click the tab and

357
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,980
you can actually also glue them

358
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,990
side-by-side and move them as a group so

359
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,850
when you are working on a project you

360
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,060
want some applications to just stay

361
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,270
together

362
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,520
yeah that's about it I could show you

363
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,779
probably so yeah that's the the updates

364
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,169
when you're updating the system packages

365
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,010
you actually have to reboot for now to

366
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:16,340
actually handle to actually install more

367
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,159
packages because it just has the

368
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,799
transaction is waiting for the the other

369
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,340
the old version of the package to be

370
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:32,059
left unused so I just reboot and then I

371
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,360
show you the interface for the package

372
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,460
manager yeah yeah my desktop is a bit

373
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,610
messy but it's bigger on the inside

374
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,260
yeah it would be easier than going to

375
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:02,779
the desk bar that's a bit wide so yeah

376
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,350
that's how it looks just like any other

377
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,719
package manager you just

378
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,450
to cite any other package manager' can

379
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,820
even create applications and whatever

380
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:26,450
and so the file system is a bit

381
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,260
different than on UNIX but we have a

382
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,780
root folder and whatever I can show you

383
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,490
this sorry

384
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,430
yeah so that's the file systems

385
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,570
currently mounted so /boot is actually

386
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,630
the root file system because slash is a

387
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,360
virtual file system as well and those

388
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,910
are the package offense instances so

389
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,640
inside slash system it's read-only but

390
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,040
you can actually install to /boot slash

391
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,880
system slash none - like a package to

392
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,460
have the read rights version if you

393
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,790
really need to for some reason and yeah

394
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,030
so that's where the packages are stored

395
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,120
there's this folder which holds the

396
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,190
Travis transactions so if you reboot

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,320
well if you can't boot the after an

398
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,990
update you can actually go into the boot

399
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,580
loader and say oh let's good this

400
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,220
version of this version so it's really

401
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,670
really handy to resolve a broken update

402
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,300
so and just last last thing well I've

403
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,940
got set a record here install and if I

404
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:50,380
just click can move the package the way

405
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:55,960
yeah it was to install the another

406
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,830
package that depends on it and then CD

407
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:05,710
are I can just I can just use it if I

408
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:13,419
just take the package back in and it's

409
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,259
it's back

410
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:25,740
and it also shuts down really fast so

411
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,570
thanks for the question for the

412
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,970
presentation for attending and we have

413
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:58,289
some time for question I think so

414
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:03,210
what about how we're support why it's

415
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,730
not really a desktop in question but we

416
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,409
do have a glue library to reuse FreeBSD

417
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:18,260
Network drivers so that's really useful

418
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,200
we have an HD audio driver that works on

419
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,760
most resistance hardware

420
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,909
I also brought it open sound when it was

421
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,549
open source like five years ago or

422
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,879
something

423
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,950
the current issue is mostly about

424
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,090
graphics card we supports visa mode so

425
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,190
at least you should be able to get to

426
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,070
desktop the problem with this machine is

427
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,549
because it costs like thousand and four

428
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:50,070
hundred euros I have a full HD panel but

429
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,370
when I would haiku I'm invisible in

430
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,570
thousand twenty four by seven hundred

431
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,720
and and video so yeah I think they did

432
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,690
publish specs now I really should have a

433
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,000
look at them

434
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,899
and I think the the bag sorry I think

435
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,850
the bag in Nouveau that crashed like

436
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,740
three times a week and this machine has

437
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,720
been fixed so I should probably be able

438
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,760
to port Nouveau to haiku when I've got

439
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,169
the time yeah we do have some OpenGL

440
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,039
support with Mesa so software rendering

441
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,460
as I think it's called SW pipe so it's a

442
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,200
bit faster than the default software

443
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,740
rendering

444
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,800
but we don't really have 3d acceleration

445
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,420
for now

446
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,809
patches welcome and we'd say so yeah

447
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,770
that's mostly most of the problems are

448
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,850
with graphics cards

449
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,290
so yeah question was used ECC to but

450
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,460
you're so GCC five or six and how is it

451
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,400
handled yes we basically do the same way

452
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,170
as on Linux you have /sleep /sit

453
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,230
whatever so you we have also had slash

454
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,360
system /lib and slash system /sleep /sit

455
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,270
which is the architecture a separate

456
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,130
architecture name nickname for GCC six

457
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,280
the the old one is named x86 underscore

458
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,429
GCC two to make sure we know difference

459
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,540
and the arm Michael Porter tool can also

460
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,390
build both when the recipe supports both

461
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,320
so usually the recipe declares

462
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,200
architecture equals x x86 GCC to

463
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,280
secondary architecture equals x86 so and

464
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,309
for things like the native web browser

465
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,320
we use WebKit and WebKit doesn't really

466
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,440
care about GCC two so yeah we have to

467
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,370
support it anyway

468
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,100
and the goal was to have binary

469
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,140
compatibility with us for our one and

470
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,530
two drop that afterwards so we are

471
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,460
working on also a newer we're just still

472
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,410
want to have the binary compatibility

473
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,250
because it's it sets a precise goal for

474
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:48,900
our one mostly so yeah we support C++

475
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,179
what about other languages

476
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,390
we are officially supported by open JDK

477
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,340
which is quite for her to to say and so

478
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,500
our Java parts is mostly working I

479
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,290
didn't really use it much but things

480
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,059
like the Arduino IDE has been packaged I

481
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,190
think the last time I try to install it

482
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,909
one of the dependency was work

483
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,159
by children

484
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,799
there's sorry I didn't try running man

485
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:33,919
fact that would be interesting or yeah

486
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,750
there are alternative free software

487
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,929
alternative to minecraft by the way

488
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:45,240
yeah there's Python we do have a QTE

489
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,520
port by the way there's QT 4 and QT 5

490
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,070
which is quite handy because some

491
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,409
software are huge we don't want to

492
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,740
rewrite them from scratch so which you

493
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,020
should be able to use QT with Python

494
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,470
maybe I didn't try Python

495
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:10,380
I think there's Perl Ruby someone

496
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,169
started the go port like long ago but

497
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:16,409
it's an ancient version and I think I

498
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,600
think somebody updated the port but I'm

499
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,370
not sure which think it is

500
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,619
