1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,940
so welcome all welcome to Michael and

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,500
then sorry if I get your last name wrong

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,400
Valesky from Lizard a CFS and the floor

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:36,280
is yours now

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,480
okay so we had some problem connecting

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,800
my other notebook so I don't have the

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,850
introductory slide what what I just want

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,059
to show is I'm the community manager for

9
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,140
visit FS and we are basically a

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,739
distributed file system and what I just

11
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,409
wanted to show was how easy it is to set

12
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,989
it up yeah we I have another talk

13
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,010
tomorrow in the SDS deaf room where I

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,890
explain for 45 minutes how it all works

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,790
but for me the most important part of

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,460
our project is it's just a 10 minutes

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,399
job to set it up right so I just

18
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:19,969
prepared a couple of containers to set

19
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:25,630
up the system the system consists out of

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,100
always the metadata server and a couple

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,670
of chunk servers what I prepared the

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,110
prepared containers already have the

23
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,240
packages on because I didn't know if the

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,509
network would be working two years ago I

25
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,130
had the experience that it didn't so I

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,719
didn't want to risk that yeah that's why

27
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,759
the key so

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,659
I would first create a master server

29
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:08,489
that a little bit here yeah that's what

30
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm just trying anyway so but I think it

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,510
will be so simple that there is not that

32
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,080
much that you cannot see so by by

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,349
default the system assumes that the

34
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,120
master server is called MSS master so my

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,720
most of my configuration is just to add

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,000
an entry into the host file for MS

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,420
master

38
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,569
and then just go into the configuration

39
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,129
directory and copy over the the sample

40
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,099
configuration files so this is all too

41
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,700
small for me

42
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,480
and then copy over an empty metadata

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,390
file in the EMFs direction

44
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,870
and then all I have to do is start oh it

45
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,000
but still have to let the master server

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
own the stuff and then all I have to do

47
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,089
is start the master server

48
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,310
come

49
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,560
can I have a running master server you

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,110
can treat that well where is it

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,590
yeah I can't

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,810
no a doesn't work let's wipe that

53
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:06,460
already wrong desktop for me yeah I

54
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,870
wanted to present it on the Apple but

55
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,230
the converter to vga does works

56
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:29,260
um anyway I can't do it so yeah I cannot

57
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,740
do it

58
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,120
ah and I have all the links on the other

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:49,010
computers yeah I can't I don't see it

60
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,790
myself

61
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:58,250
great no no and I have to start the

62
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,420
monitoring service as well

63
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,669
what

64
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:29,250
blind typing let me see what port it's

65
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,240
running on four to five

66
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:46,420
yes it's a thing what am i doing

67
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,100
what is wrong

68
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,130
okay

69
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,880
no it's 9 for 25 at least that's what it

70
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,449
writes here

71
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,530
but I can see

72
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,880
great

73
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:57,640
but what spine 425

74
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:18,870
okay yeah

75
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,730
but

76
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,640
yeah

77
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:42,159
[Applause]

78
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,170
so I can see that my master was running

79
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,210
right that's all I wanted to show I just

80
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:54,350
tried it on the wrong machine anyway so

81
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,280
what I do next is connect the junk

82
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:16,430
server if I would do that on that

83
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,140
machine on my machine that would be

84
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,570
simpler but all that one I don't know

85
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:31,570
how anyway

86
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,020
you have to get a different converter

87
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:42,490
for tomorrow so what I did on the tank

88
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,220
server is basically the same entry in

89
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,030
the hosts file

90
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,410
I think that's visible it's just for the

91
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,780
NFS master so that the chunk server can

92
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:59,760
find its and find the metadata server

93
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,510
[Applause]

94
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,480
okay yeah the MFF master entry is not

95
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,230
that our decision so the container has

96
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,540
the chunk server package installed it's

97
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,720
just on that units apt-get desert FS

98
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,300
chunk server and on CentOS it's the same

99
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,970
stuff with yum right and again I

100
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,840
prepared a directory for the chunks over

101
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,130
where it's going to keep its chunks it's

102
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,930
called wizard fs1 so all I have to do

103
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,480
now is see the right keys in the dark

104
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,180
and just tell the chunk server where it

105
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,079
can find its stuff

106
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:04,850
I just put here

107
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:18,930
the directory and just copy over the

108
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,060
default files and start the chunks of

109
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
oops

110
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:39,959
probably running alright so I got back

111
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:48,569
to my monitoring I see my time zone okay

112
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,040
see my chunks over I can see that it has

113
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,980
a disc that's basically all what I can

114
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,540
do next is add another track server

115
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:14,100
now this chunk silver is sent off I have

116
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,390
another chunk server that's running on

117
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,290
Debian so I do exactly the same thing if

118
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,980
I see the keys

119
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,719
good guy

120
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,250
I really don't care

121
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,820
[Music]

122
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,949
so now I have a second one on running on

123
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:44,509
center no let me see if I managed to

124
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:48,169
connect a dark client so for my clients

125
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:52,519
I do exactly the same with the hosts

126
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,589
file so that we can find the metadata

127
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:01,089
server and then I just tell him to wait

128
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,089
yeah

129
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,310
I set him up where he has to mount when

130
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,350
he said mount we we distributed file

131
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,050
system and just tell him go ahead and do

132
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,500
it oops

133
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,760
yeah there so I bet they can now have a

134
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,920
mounted distributed file system on two

135
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:44,140
servers any questions

136
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:10,470
that's a very silent question thank you

137
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,390
for the talk is there any possibility is

138
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,720
this deport over to say BSD family all

139
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,500
these straight Linux BSD I run it on

140
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,900
Solaris you can probably run it on H

141
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,700
bucks as well I didn't try but it

142
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,470
shouldn't be that much of a problem

143
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,550
ax should work as well there is

144
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,330
commercial Windows client and there is a

145
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,120
commercial type chunk servers so that

146
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,520
you could basically talk to a tape

147
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,260
library like to each other so if time

148
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,190
for one more question

149
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:55,230
anybody well up so no are no more

150
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,150
questions and thank you all and

151
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,760
you
