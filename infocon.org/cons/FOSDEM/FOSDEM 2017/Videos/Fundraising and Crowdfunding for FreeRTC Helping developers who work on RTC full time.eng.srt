1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,890
okay and back in 1973 there was a

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,920
psychology experiment conducted by two

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,640
researchers Lepper and green masks and

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,529
children to make some drawings

5
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,150
has anyone heard of this famous

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,160
experiment okay so they rounded up about

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,899
50 children who liked drawing okay and

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,010
coloring is well drawing and coloring

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,629
they divided them all into three groups

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,480
children in the first group were told

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,179
that they would now get paid for

12
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,719
coloring in the second group the

13
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,399
children were going to be given a

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,609
surprise reward after coloring and the

15
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,739
children in the third group were not

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:03,050
going to get anything they separated the

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,239
children into individual rooms and let

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,590
them draw now after drawing the student

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,450
showed the children in the first and

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,350
second group received their rewards and

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,240
the children in the third group got

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,080
nothing then over the next week that

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,850
they continued to bring the children

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,290
back and let them do a little bit of

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,680
drawing each day and they monitored the

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,230
amount of drawing the children did the

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,350
children who'd been promised a reward

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,840
for drawing did substantially less

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,150
drawing in the subsequent week then the

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,930
children in the other two groups the

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,560
children who were offered or who were

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,570
given a surprise reward after drawing

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,760
and the children who were not offered

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,120
any reward at all did substantially more

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,400
they continued to do drawings because

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,640
they enjoyed drawing and the children in

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,950
the first group who had been offered a

38
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,180
reward and they can they basically

39
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,580
slowed down as if they were waiting for

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,680
another incentive to be offered before

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
they would start again

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,180
and I bring this example up because yeah

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,400
we're we're talking about bringing money

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,180
and when we're talking about

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,010
crowdfunding which I'd bringing money

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,230
into communities where we have people

47
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,260
working professionally and where we have

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,910
people working as volunteers yeah we're

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,940
here on a Saturday on a weekend and some

50
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,950
people come here as part of their job

51
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,540
other people come here because they

52
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,730
enjoy being part of fosston part of

53
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,010
debian and part of the wider free

54
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,680
software movement and so it's important

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,560
to talk about the impact that money has

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,620
before we talk about crowdfunding and

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,390
when I was about 10 I used to draw I was

58
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,970
actually packing up my grandparents

59
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,690
house last month and I came across their

60
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,120
drawing and I think I stopped drawing

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,330
myself at about that time not because of

62
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,630
money and but because of our family you

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,350
only take the future because our family

64
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,180
got a computer so by the time I was 12 I

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,230
was programming assembly code and and by

66
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,930
the time I was 14 I was getting my

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,870
amateur radio call sign and so I stopped

68
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,100
drawing for different races

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,220
nonetheless those other activities like

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,670
computer programming and amateur radio

71
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,180
and some aspects of those I've done

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,490
professionally for many years but there

73
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,050
are other things like the amateur radio

74
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,020
that I've never received any financial

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,140
incentive for and I continue to enjoy it

76
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,060
in the same way that I did when I was a

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,970
child who didn't have to work or think

78
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,890
about money at all and I don't think I

79
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,090
even had a bank account when I was 14

80
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,010
that's when I started doing electronics

81
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:33,080
and radio and fast forward to 2011 and

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,000
you know smartphones were really taking

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
off back then and many people were

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,760
asking me do you have viber do you have

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,070
whatsapp can we communicate with you

86
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,190
through Skype and when I wasn't really

87
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,350
interested in trying any of those things

88
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,350
because they're not free and my interest

89
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,040
in communication technologies was

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,950
reinvigorated I forked the SIP droid

91
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,480
project which is an app for Android and

92
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,590
created my own project called luma call

93
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,060
aiming to do some of the things that you

94
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,280
can do with viber and whatsapp one of

95
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,410
the main features is that when you

96
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,840
install it it links to your phone number

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,270
so it sets up your account very very

98
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,780
quickly

99
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,930
many of the free software apps that you

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,720
install either on the desktop or on your

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,570
phone expect you to set up a server or

102
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,940
to go out and get an occipital

103
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,370
which all takes extra effort and this is

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,810
one of the reasons why a lot of people

105
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,750
are not using them so so when I made my

106
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,240
Lumia called Project I aim to have that

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,910
simplicity that had made apps like viber

108
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,370
and whatsapp so successful so quickly

109
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,120
and they launched the first version of

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,350
luma call at FOSDEM in 2012

111
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,950
yeah since then I've been tinkering away

112
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,650
at Lu McCall in my spare time

113
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,110
basically fixing things when I need to

114
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,510
fix them for something I want to do

115
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,200
myself so I haven't personally done any

116
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,980
paid development on Blue Macaw when

117
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,840
there are many other projects like this

118
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,150
that people have been developing some

119
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,160
people have been contributing to them as

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,090
volunteers

121
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,340
other people develop them as part of

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,350
their job there are some companies that

123
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,620
have been willing to sponsor projects

124
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,190
like this and Google is very generously

125
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,620
sponsored many students in the google

126
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,500
Summer of Code and they also spent sixty

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,260
million dollars acquiring the web RTC

128
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,110
code which is in the chromium browser

129
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,290
and that's all free software now and and

130
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,060
so a lot of these different things have

131
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,500
been going on in the last five years

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,910
there are a number of other alternatives

133
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,700
to luma call now there's signal from

134
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,060
open whisper systems which I also aims

135
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,340
to have a big emphasis on security

136
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,280
there's ring which aims to offer a

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,300
distributed hash table peer-to-peer

138
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,280
experiences conversations which is an

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,910
XMPP chat app for your phone that's

140
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,720
extremely convenient and at the same

141
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,010
time as all these things have been

142
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,770
emerging and there's also been more and

143
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,190
more public debate about privacy of

144
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,310
digital communications in fact the

145
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,830
debates you know got a lot of attention

146
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,430
in 2013 when mr. Snowden started leaking

147
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,070
documents from the US government some of

148
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,290
the stuff that appeared from Snowden is

149
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,169
very very concerning but when you think

150
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,260
about it the private sector is often a

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,090
lot more efficient than the government

152
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,919
so everything that you've read about the

153
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,770
NSA you can assume that companies like

154
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,040
Facebook and Skype doing three times

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,870
better when it comes to monitoring

156
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,020
people and analyzing their data and

157
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,539
finding ways to use it for their

158
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,280
interests which are not always

159
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,360
in common with your interests I mean

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
when you think about it

161
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,370
Skype is a lot like it's sausage if he

162
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,120
knew what was inside it there's no way

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,590
you would eat it one thing that's been

164
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,440
obvious to me for a number of years now

165
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,690
is that developing an app like loom

166
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,240
recall is not something that I can

167
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,640
completely do on my own there are some

168
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,580
things like testing on multiple

169
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,670
smartphones that it's just impossible

170
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,830
because every year there are thousands

171
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,050
of new phones there are new versions of

172
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,710
Android and users report bugs that I

173
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,200
have no chance of reproducing on any of

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,380
the phones I have myself and so for some

175
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,220
of these things to ever be analyzed by a

176
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,410
developer we need to take another

177
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,760
approach I mean there's an example of

178
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,080
many of the different phones that are

179
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,300
out there today or I mean these are a

180
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,240
little bit old now but you but it makes

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,830
the point there are just so many phones

182
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,320
out there it's impossible for volunteers

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,460
to keep up with them all the

184
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,820
communications space services but

185
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,700
multiple than use cases and in these

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
photos that I've put up here now you can

187
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,330
see on the left-hand side you've got

188
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,670
private communications with family

189
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,370
members or with people that you have a

190
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,589
very trusting relationship with like

191
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,290
your doctor or maybe your tax accountant

192
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,170
and and on the other picture you've got

193
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,940
big business and you've got

194
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,900
organizations you've got governments

195
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,640
government departments universities and

196
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,070
hospitals their needs are very different

197
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,460
from the needs of private individuals

198
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,700
and so when you make a call to your

199
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,450
mother or to your spouse you know

200
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,339
exactly who it is you want to talk to

201
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:20,920
when you call your bank you've got no

202
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,300
idea who's going to answer the phone

203
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,340
so securing these types of

204
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,950
communications is very different the

205
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,430
volunteer and community development

206
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,980
tends to take a bigger interest in the

207
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,560
private communications that we have with

208
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,530
our friends and family after all why

209
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,530
would we spend our weekends developing

210
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,900
things to meet the needs of big business

211
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,330
but nonetheless orgonite big

212
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,210
organizations and also have to use

213
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,490
communications technology and we do have

214
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,370
to communicate with them I mean 20 years

215
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,610
ago many big businesses and government

216
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,320
departments and what have you were using

217
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,850
fax machines when email became viable

218
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,380
they all threw their fax machines away

219
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,810
and how often do you see a fax machine

220
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,130
these days and many small businesses

221
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,190
don't have one at all when they just use

222
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,970
email for everything nonetheless email

223
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,130
provides an interesting example it's a

224
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,860
federated technology that is very

225
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,680
different from say a peer-to-peer

226
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,840
technology such as ring Adrian is here

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,630
talking about ring before and this is a

228
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,390
solution that's great for security of

229
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,420
private communications but it may not be

230
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,660
very attractive to businesses and

231
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,340
organizations and so they're going to be

232
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,050
much more interested in federated

233
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,730
solutions like sip and XMPP so making

234
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,180
these sorts of solutions viable for big

235
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,910
organizations and raises some

236
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,430
interesting questions if they don't have

237
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,030
free solutions based on open standards

238
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,360
and free software and there's a big

239
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,800
possibility that they're going to go

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,470
with proprietary solutions and how would

241
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,010
you like it if you had to use Skype or

242
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,350
something similar to call your bank and

243
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,740
if you were forced to use Facebook to

244
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,750
communicate with some organizations I

245
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,360
mean you can already see there are some

246
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,000
app developers like tinder you're

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,920
insisting you have a Facebook account to

248
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,139
you

249
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,540
their service you haven't yet seen banks

250
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,179
going down that path but in five years

251
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,329
or ten years what will the world look

252
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,220
like you know what will big

253
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,929
organizations expect when they

254
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,579
communicate with you or when you

255
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,639
communicate with them the US government

256
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,109
has recently been talking about

257
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,749
insisting that people applying for the

258
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,850
visa waiver program have to give their

259
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,869
Facebook address so so these sort of

260
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,239
things are starting to appear and if we

261
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:09,749
don't have free alternatives and the

262
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:12,149
alternatives that that a proprietary are

263
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:22,350
very very scary and so this is why I

264
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,589
raise the topic of crowdfunding and who

265
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,069
does like sepal XMPP or other

266
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,669
development on a professional basis so

267
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,540
there's part of their job

268
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,749
okay so many people and so we already

269
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,480
have money coming into this space so

270
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,429
we're not necessarily going to run into

271
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,619
the problems that leather and grain

272
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:45,480
encountered when they started giving

273
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,699
money to the children people are already

274
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,100
doing development in this space and

275
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,290
releasing code that's free you've got

276
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,059
huge projects like asterisk free switch

277
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:01,049
Camilo and jitsi and a lot of them have

278
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,179
been developed with money from

279
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,049
organizations and but a lot of the money

280
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,209
that's coming into these projects is not

281
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:14,089
placing an emphasis on Federation or

282
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,259
interoperability over the public

283
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,759
Internet they're only looking at

284
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,919
replacing their internal phone system

285
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,399
and so crowdfunding may be able to lift

286
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,730
the attention on the federated solutions

287
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,539
in this space nonetheless there have

288
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,819
already been some crowdfunding

289
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:33,509
initiatives

290
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,109
I mean freedombox

291
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,489
appeared in 2011 they went on to

292
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,589
Kickstarter and they raised eighty six

293
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,989
thousand dollars they've been making a

294
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:48,490
little bit of progress every year

295
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,050
but they're still not at the point of

296
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,990
releasing you know 1.0 and it's still

297
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,090
not a complete solution you know it's a

298
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,430
very exciting project and it's having a

299
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,700
really positive impact but it's after

300
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,590
five years the problem is not being

301
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,820
solved I mean diaspora

302
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,510
raised two hundred thousand dollars

303
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,450
they've got maybe six hundred thousand

304
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,880
users now but they still haven't quite

305
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,710
delivered everything that was promised

306
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,840
in their crowdfunding campaign and that

307
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,720
was also over five years ago so people

308
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,000
are starting to look at these types of

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
campaigns with a lot more scrutiny

310
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,650
saying yeah how long will it take to

311
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,130
deliver what if something goes wrong I

312
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,040
mean there was a an example that

313
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,920
appeared recently was the peachy printer

314
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,560
as a 3d printer project did anyone hear

315
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,550
about peachy printer on Kickstarter so

316
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,500
they raised about five hundred thousand

317
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,940
dollars that's more than double what

318
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,860
diaspora race and they just wanted to

319
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,290
produce a 3d printer with the money went

320
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,420
into making a house for one of the

321
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,240
developers instead leaving the other

322
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,180
leader of the project and all the donors

323
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,170
have been upset that the project is now

324
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,860
bankrupt

325
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,120
there is no 3d printer there's a house

326
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,700
so this question of accountability is

327
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,230
getting a lot of attention now

328
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,660
so I've been thinking about this how can

329
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,540
we make sure that projects don't go on

330
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,060
and on you know for five to ten years

331
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,790
how can we make sure that people don't

332
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,769
just run off with the money and how can

333
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,660
we make sure the donors have the

334
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,540
confidence you know to put money into a

335
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,279
project knowing that these things won't

336
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,010
happen and so there are two points that

337
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,870
I've I've identified that can help this

338
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,320
one is to make concise deliverables so

339
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,019
rather than having this goal of let's

340
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,390
replace Facebook which sounds great or

341
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,329
let's replace Skype and we come up with

342
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,730
some specific targets like let's make a

343
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,130
library that can help match you know

344
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,319
phone numbers to sip users or phone

345
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,500
numbers to XMPP accounts and so that's a

346
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,520
much more discreet objective and it

347
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
still helps us move closer to the goal

348
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,240
so let's make a list of these things

349
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
that we can deliver that are easy to

350
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,189
define and easy to determine when

351
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,000
they're complete and the other point

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,650
he's putting all of these into a project

353
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,590
management tool like redmine and I mean

354
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,480
there are other tools as well but I've

355
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,450
picked a red mine in this case because

356
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,890
if we put them into a tool like this

357
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,290
then it we become very accountable the

358
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,090
whole thing is very public people can

359
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,330
see exactly what we're going to do who's

360
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,190
going to do it and how much progress

361
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,240
they're making and

362
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,020
now redmine also lets us do other things

363
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,690
beyond dealing with this question of

364
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,070
accountability and in this screenshot

365
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,060
there are a few little things i've

366
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,210
demonstrated here many crowdfunding

367
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,120
platforms have a concept of different

368
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
thresholds so for your first hundred

369
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,950
thousand dollars or a hundred thousand

370
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,820
euros you're going to do your core

371
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,260
deliverables and if you raise double

372
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,850
that money let's say you raise two

373
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,830
hundred thousand and then you're going

374
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,020
to do some additional things so we can

375
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,940
go through each of the deliverables and

376
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,430
and identify which one of those

377
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,710
thresholds they're associated with we

378
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,630
can use one of the custom fields a

379
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,450
pulldown menu to classify them like that

380
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,660
and that makes it even easier to manage

381
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,270
one of these campaigns we can also use

382
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,670
custom fields in redmine to help

383
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,040
cost the project to make sure that we're

384
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,220
able to deliver these things within

385
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,830
those thresholds and there are three

386
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,100
fields here related to costing the time

387
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,210
estimations are useful for some types of

388
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,090
development work some things have a

389
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,990
fixed cost let's say that we need to

390
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,070
develop a user interface and we've got a

391
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,230
developer who's going to do that design

392
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,090
work for a fixed amount of money so

393
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,520
we're instead of putting in hours we can

394
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,830
put in the fee that that developer is

395
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,620
willing to be paid for that work and

396
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,980
some things have a percentage cost and

397
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,750
when you're looking at platforms like

398
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,370
Kickstarter they're actually a lot of

399
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,660
different fees and things like the

400
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,850
crowdfunding platform has their fee the

401
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,610
credit card companies have their fee you

402
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,760
might have taxes that you have to pay if

403
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
you're dealing with more than one

404
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,630
currency you've got fees for converting

405
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,590
the money and those are usually

406
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,440
percentages so I've added another custom

407
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,070
field for percentages and so we can put

408
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,990
all of those things including things

409
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,450
like the credit card fees into redmine

410
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,870
as a separate project right

411
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,590
and and then put in one of these three

412
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,960
different measurements so that we can

413
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,670
build up the total cost of the project

414
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,190
much more accurately so it's not

415
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,770
guesswork anymore and another thing that

416
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,190
I've added in here links to external bug

417
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,130
trackers so if one of the things that

418
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,840
we're aiming to do in a crowdfunding

419
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,480
campaign is part of another project such

420
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,520
as camilo we can link to their Bob

421
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,250
tracker for that issue and if there are

422
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,320
wiki pages or other documents we can

423
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,350
link to those as well and that makes it

424
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,120
much easier for people to follow looking

425
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,210
at that previous screenshot again I've

426
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,360
also added tags so this is an issue

427
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,460
that's tagged for sip and XMPP and and

428
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,059
we can look at lists of issues with each

429
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,240
of the different tags so these are

430
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,630
issues tagged with Java so I've made a

431
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,400
Python script that extracts things from

432
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,040
redmine and so there's already been

433
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,290
development on this in making the

434
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,320
reports and extracting the issues from

435
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,330
redmine and building reports for every

436
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,130
tag so these issues are tagged with Java

437
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,170
so that lets Java developers see things

438
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,750
they could potentially work on this was

439
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,790
actually really useful within google

440
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,790
Summer of Code last year I asked the

441
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,460
students who wanted to do projects to

442
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,980
look through the issues based on the

443
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,690
programming languages that they're

444
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,250
familiar with and and so this this came

445
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,870
in really useful even before we started

446
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,030
any crowdfunding discussion and I've

447
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,100
also been able to tag them with use

448
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,110
cases like hosting and

449
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,330
so for a crowdfunding campaign to gain

450
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,030
momentum early we need to have a few

451
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,980
people who are going to step in on day

452
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,270
one then throw in some money early on

453
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,559
these are the people who often come in

454
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,620
with $1,000 or $5,000 on the first day

455
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,230
and then other people come and follow

456
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,789
that very quickly because it gets

457
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,240
attention it appears on Slashdot and so

458
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,280
for something like this to go ahead one

459
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,760
thing I need to do is to to identify

460
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,169
organizations that might want to sponsor

461
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,970
something like this before it's

462
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,490
officially announced and so if anyone

463
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,220
here has any ideas like that feel free

464
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,590
to come and speak to me or email me

465
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,909
afterwards and another topic that comes

466
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,980
up with it with many of the crowdfunding

467
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,309
platforms is gifts and rewards and what

468
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,559
do you offer people as an incentive to

469
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,280
be one of the early donors and I mean

470
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,020
one of the most successful musicians on

471
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,020
the Kickstarter platform offered people

472
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,510
the opportunity to come to a party in

473
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,860
Berlin and write on her body undressed

474
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,960
and with textures in the middle of the

475
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,440
night she raised 1.2 million dollars for

476
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,179
creating an album which was a much

477
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,559
better than she could get from any

478
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,289
record company but can you imagine

479
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,510
people queuing up to write on a naked

480
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:35,490
hacker and I mean I've got some concerns

481
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,720
that you know is this a too big a

482
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,030
sacrifice to make to develop solutions

483
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:47,970
to help people with privacy so what sort

484
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,120
of rewards are useful for this type of

485
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
software project and when you're talking

486
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,039
about crowdfunding for a software

487
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,429
project everyone who donates is going to

488
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,890
get the software anyway so that so the

489
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,870
rewards are always going to be more

490
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,429
trivial than the product you're

491
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,480
producing this is unlike all the other

492
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,740
projects that you say like the 3d

493
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,650
printers and hardware projects and games

494
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,330
and things like that because

495
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,179
when the company produces it you still

496
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,549
have to pay for it even if you donate it

497
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,210
but with free software projects

498
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,369
everyone's going to get it as a reward

499
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,019
anyway but you still have to offer

500
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,669
something else as a gift so if you've

501
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,309
got ideas about gifts that would

502
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,830
incentivize people to donate to

503
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,840
something then I'd also love to hear

504
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,960
about that one thing that comes up is

505
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,320
sometimes a sponsor steps in and give

506
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,409
some sort of a gift that they can afford

507
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:48,929
to give for stock they have leftover and

508
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:51,210
this can make the campaign a lot more

509
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,549
productive so just think about it and

510
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,619
would you like to be able to call your

511
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,269
family and friends with free software

512
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:05,190
this Christmas and if we do something

513
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,850
like that

514
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,399
this year and it succeeds then that's

515
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:11,850
very very possible and but if something

516
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,629
like this isn't done and if we don't try

517
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:17,960
then another year will go by with

518
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,609
organizations like Skype and viber and

519
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:22,830
whatsapp will have become stronger and

520
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,809
free software will have even more

521
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,139
difficulty getting into the getting

522
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:30,889
market share

523
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,940
yep okay any questions

524
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,679
okay I think we've run out of time so

525
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,419
we're going to go straight into the next

526
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,419
session and have you got communication

527
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,809
with the

528
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:07,239
