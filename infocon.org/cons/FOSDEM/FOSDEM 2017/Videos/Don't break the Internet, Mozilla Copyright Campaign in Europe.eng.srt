2
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,999
thank you thank you

3
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,679
Hey

4
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,199
hi so I'm Reagan McDonald's I'm senior

5
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,149
EU policy manager at Mozilla in the

6
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,399
public policy team I'm based here in

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,370
Brussels and I work on EU legislation I

8
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,670
work on privacy on data protection net

9
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,149
neutrality and copyright so today I want

10
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,399
to tell you a little bit about Mozilla's

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
copyright campaign here in Europe

12
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,839
something that we're investing a lot of

13
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,189
time and a lot of effort into improving

14
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,340
so first good news after nearly a decade

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,770
the European Commission has finally come

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,840
forward with a proposal to reform

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,420
copyright and frankly it couldn't have

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,079
come soon enough

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,750
the copyright framework that we have now

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,079
is from 2001 this predates the

21
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,710
smartphone we were still using VHS

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,130
it's very fragmented and a little bit

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,439
confusing and out-of-date so we were

24
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,409
very excited to know in fact encouraging

25
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,640
the European Commission and the EU

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,159
institutions to reform legislation to

27
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,100
bring copyright into the 21st century to

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,590
think about how to add flexibility to

29
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,590
create a regulatory environment that

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,810
would foster and encourage creativity

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,130
and innovation online so the bad news is

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,189
the copyright reform that we have right

33
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,130
now that is right now being debated by

34
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,140
the European Parliament and the council

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,190
is not the copyright reform that we need

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,410
this reform focuses a lot on some major

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,990
industry rights holders

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,520
and it is very much focused on

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,020
enforcement it does very little to

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,990
address what the user can do and would

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,910
not in our view promote innovation or

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,760
creativity online rather some of these

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,380
proposals risk undermining that and so

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,900
before I go into I mean what I basically

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,520
want to do in the 20 minutes is give you

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,160
guys a general overview of the four

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,320
major issues that we are focusing on in

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,570
this copyright reform and then give you

49
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,720
an idea of of how you can help because

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,460
we need your voices in this in this

51
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,830
debate when I first just want to explain

52
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,290
why Mozilla approaches an organization

53
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,170
that builds the Firefox web browser and

54
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,270
as a global community why we care about

55
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,490
copyright reform well first we're a

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,350
mission-driven organization we want to

57
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,500
ensure that the internet remains a

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,030
public global public resource that's

59
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,610
open and accessible to all and also as

60
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,500
being a community a global community of

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,680
makers and builders and hackers we want

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,080
to make sure that especially in

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,270
legislation people are allowed and in

64
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,640
fact encouraged to take something teton

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,080
to make something new to actually

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,580
express themselves and to build

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,700
something so we want we want to make

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,610
sure that the laws kind of have that

69
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,140
potential and are not actually

70
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,600
restrictive and so copyright law

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,880
actually can dictate a lot of what you

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,730
can and can't do and so that's why we

73
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,050
want to make sure that this copyright

74
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,880
reform in Europe actually ends up

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,010
benefiting users and benefiting

76
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,840
innovation and not the other way around

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,740
and so just as a disclaimer we're not

78
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,010
trying to abolish copyright I feel like

79
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,590
I should just say that we think that

80
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,010
copyright can be perfectly a great

81
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,350
mechanism I mean ostensibly it's

82
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,730
supposed to be built as a kind of

83
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,450
remuneration incentives idea which can

84
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,260
advance all sorts of cultural things our

85
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,738
scientific progress to remunerative this

86
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,770
can be good but not if it's not balanced

87
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,610
if it's Maximus copyright and is only

88
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,350
benefiting a handful of stakeholders and

89
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,680
it doesn't actually

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,419
account for all of the different actors

91
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,479
in the web ecosystem then it needs to be

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,660
reformed we need to have a balanced

93
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,620
copyright reform so I will go briefly

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,150
through the four issues that we're

95
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,120
focusing on and I even put the articles

96
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,400
if you want to get wonky and I have a

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,470
little handout that also explains in

98
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,770
like these four issues as well so the

99
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,039
first one is upload filters this is

100
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,560
article 13 this is probably the most

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,680
dangerous proposal that is in the

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,419
copyright directive right now and

103
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,050
basically what it proposes is three

104
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,009
things one to make platforms open

105
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,810
platforms that host large amounts of

106
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,750
copyrighted content to become liable for

107
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,729
that content which means they become

108
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,699
liable for the actions of their users

109
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,820
the second thing it would require is

110
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,250
that any of these platforms that are

111
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,780
hosting large amounts of copyrighted

112
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,630
content would have to conclude some kind

113
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,220
of deals or agreements with rights

114
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,010
holders it doesn't specify exactly what

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,330
but maybe that means licensing

116
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,220
agreements but essentially they would

117
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,289
seek permission from rights holders

118
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,419
before having that copyrighted content

119
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,960
on their platforms and the third thing

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,780
which is the most concerning is that in

121
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,380
order to to uphold these agreements that

122
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,270
they make they have to make sure that

123
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,250
they are not infringing these agreements

124
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,520
so they must implement filters content

125
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,400
recognition technologies to make sure

126
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,650
that these deals are upheld and this

127
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,650
applies to all kinds of copyright not

128
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,570
just music but all sorts of copyright

129
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,690
and it's not just for YouTube and other

130
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,060
major platforms but it would extend to

131
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,960
Wikipedia to github to anything read hit

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,060
take your pick

133
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,340
so we really need to reduce that that

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,780
article and bring it back in line with

135
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,500
EU law and the second thing we want to

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,270
do which actually is not in the proposal

137
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,550
but this is something that we feel is

138
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,180
missing in order to add a sort of user

139
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,210
focus right for copyright that is

140
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,569
missing

141
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,469
right now and that's a user-generated

142
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:49,679
content exception so we want to add this

143
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,889
to make it legal and in fact encourage

144
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,529
the types of ways that content and

145
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,809
information and culture is access

146
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:02,129
remixed and shared online and we think

147
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,409
that from Mozilla's point of view it

148
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,869
would really take the spirit I think of

149
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,909
the open source community and put that

150
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,449
into copyright law so we would like to

151
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,469
see that included the the third thing is

152
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,990
a neighboring right for press publishers

153
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,119
and that's an article 11 you might have

154
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,309
heard this we called a snippet tax or

155
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,659
Google tax has anyone heard of that a

156
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,999
few people okay so basically this is a

157
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,659
proposal to extend copyright so this

158
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:36,209
would extend to press publishers for the

159
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:39,499
uses of their press publications online

160
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:42,419
what that means I think because the

161
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,209
article doesn't exactly specify that

162
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,899
major press publications would get to

163
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,519
charge different aggregators for

164
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,589
indexing their content based on the

165
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,899
snippet so a handful of words or the

166
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,039
title plus the hyperlink we're opposed

167
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,249
to this for a number of reasons one it's

168
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,159
a failed policy two it has a lot of

169
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,559
negative implications for access to

170
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,419
information and three it it hurts

171
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,579
smaller players and creates more burdens

172
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,619
to entry into the market this has

173
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,259
already been attempted in Germany and

174
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,139
Spain and has failed miserably in Spain

175
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,449
where this is still implemented a

176
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,759
handful of startups had to close their

177
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,129
doors because they either couldn't

178
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,949
afford to pay for these press snippets

179
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,078
or just because of the legal certainty

180
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,679
that was created in Germany from a

181
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,208
competition point of view this was

182
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,179
actually quite bad because a few a few

183
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,679
small aggregators had to close their

184
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,170
doors but it also entrenched the power

185
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,800
of one of the major aggregators which

186
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,339
was Google so Google News and Google

187
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,069
search so in 2013 when this law was was

188
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,300
negotiated a law

189
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,660
the focus centered around Google around

190
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,300
these big a driven based platforms that

191
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,660
need to pay their fair share but since

192
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,970
it has been implemented these large

193
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,330
platforms haven't paid a cent so it

194
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,220
doesn't really seem to accomplish

195
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,160
anything and it hasn't benefited even

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,680
the publishers and it also has the

197
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,390
negative implication of reducing

198
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,000
information online so we would like to

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,040
see that removed from the proposal and

200
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,709
the last thing is in article 3 and

201
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,450
that's TDM it's text and data mining

202
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,160
this is a new exception that the

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,690
European Commission will has proposed

204
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,820
text and data mining is basically a way

205
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,940
to read large data sets it's an

206
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,640
algorithm or software that you can apply

207
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,490
in order to to to mine a bunch of

208
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,279
articles at the same time so we think

209
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,050
that in a data-driven you know in a Big

210
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,589
Data universe it is key to be able to to

211
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,000
read and to understand large data sets

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,890
unfortunately the exception would only

213
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,870
apply to research institutions so that's

214
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,029
one step forward but we need much much

215
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,190
much much more so if you're an

216
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,529
independent researcher if you are a data

217
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,410
journalist if you're an NGO if you are

218
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,260
startup this would not actually apply to

219
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,180
you so we want to make sure that text

220
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,370
and data mining can actually apply to

221
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,520
the full range of beneficiaries and not

222
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,750
just research institutions and so

223
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,040
finally we really really need your help

224
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,170
this directive is now being negotiated

225
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,540
it's going through the EU sausage

226
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,149
machine the Commission has proposed it

227
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:43,920
and now it's being debated in the

228
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
European Parliament and in the council

229
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,079
so in your Member States and in the

230
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,510
parliament people really need to hear

231
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,440
your voice and something I can say from

232
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,180
being in Brussels you know speaking at a

233
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,649
lot of events and having a lot of

234
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,040
meetings the debate around copyright it

235
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,990
becomes very emotive and is very

236
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,920
unfortunately binary so unhealthily

237
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,190
binary so the the broad debate is really

238
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,110
big major platforms or big companies

239
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,990
from Silicon Valley versus the rights

240
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,639
holders versus the the press

241
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,399
publications the music and film industry

242
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,430
but it fails to actually understand all

243
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,610
of the different levels of stakeholders

244
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,610
that are going to be impacted by this

245
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,100
the levels of creators and makers and so

246
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,870
you guys are creators those who make

247
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,360
software those who build software who

248
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,610
are making the internet better so we

249
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,339
really need you to to to weigh in and to

250
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,649
talk to your MVPs talk to your members

251
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,870
of European Parliament but even to to

252
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,250
talk to people in your country about how

253
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,139
important this is so we can shift the

254
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,519
balance to make sure that we get a

255
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,410
copyright reform that actually works for

256
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,449
us and supports the interests of

257
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,610
everyone in the web ecosystem rather

258
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,370
than just a handful a handful a few

259
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,670
major major major companies so that's my

260
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,050
presentation I'm happy to take questions

261
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,750
because I went as fast as I could I also

262
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,180
even brought a handout if some of you

263
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,810
guys want and my email address so

264
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,810
something that Mozilla will be doing

265
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,000
unchanged copyright we have some videos

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,220
and a petition over the next few weeks

267
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,250
we will be updating we will have a new

268
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,949
petition coming and we will be

269
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:35,279
mobilizing people to take action at key

270
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,079
moments in the in the debate in the

271
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,910
European Parliament and we'll also be

272
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,370
organizing a series of events across

273
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,410
Europe so we've already started doing

274
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,889
that in Germany and France and we would

275
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,660
like to do more so if you're interested

276
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,420
in participating in these events or even

277
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,360
organizing some of them please feel free

278
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,980
to contact me and yeah thank you

279
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:08,860
[Applause]

280
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:28,370
does anyone have any questions yes I'm

281
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,589
so glad you said that because oh the

282
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,779
question was is filtering actually

283
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,149
lawful in the EU and is there a plan to

284
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,630
actually stop this from happening so the

285
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,260
answer is yes and yes a million times

286
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,060
it's it's very so I was reading when you

287
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,829
read article 13 I have this feeling that

288
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,579
we're all living in this Trump augmented

289
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,910
reality universe where like law doesn't

290
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,720
matter and facts clearly don't matter

291
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,820
but yes in the EU especially there is

292
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,310
case law and there's legislation that it

293
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,529
prevails over this that is supposed to

294
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,170
say that says that platforms are not

295
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,120
supposed to have a general monitoring

296
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,579
obligation they're not supposed to have

297
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:16,370
to filter and monitor every single thing

298
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,779
that gets uploaded on their platforms

299
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,120
this was designed for a lot of reasons

300
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,069
but one of which is because there's also

301
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,069
privacy laws here and you can't at the

302
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,199
one hand protect privacy and data

303
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,870
protection as a fundamental right and at

304
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,550
the same time filter every single thing

305
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,339
that's that's going up so so there are a

306
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,959
lot of plans I mean that for us this is

307
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,230
our major issue we want to bring the

308
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,690
proposal at the very least in line with

309
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,870
the existing law and see Ju case law and

310
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,800
there's a number of different

311
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,060
organizations that are working on

312
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,680
copyright that are also organizing

313
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,899
campaigns currently the communion

314
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,290
network a jury so they're all coming

315
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,550
together and I think they'll be coming

316
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,170
up with platforms and and definitely

317
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,649
ways to to raise awareness about this

318
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,350
but then also channel people's voices to

319
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,459
say no we don't want upload filters yeah

320
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,500
so that will definitely be focusing on

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,949
that I think

322
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
yes

323
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,399
yeah that's a good question so when we

324
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,170
first saw Missoula this is like our

325
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,149
second wave of the campaign when we

326
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,450
first started to get our community

327
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,080
communities aware and raise awareness

328
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,550
about this that we're working on

329
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,470
copyright and that copyright reform was

330
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,560
coming down the pipes we had focused on

331
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,110
a bunch of different issues including

332
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,330
the freedom of panorama which is one

333
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,000
exception that has not been included in

334
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,370
the directive but we thought it was a

335
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,200
relatively low hanging fruit and

336
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,720
basically the the freedom of panorama is

337
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,540
the copyright exception that allows you

338
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,459
to take pictures of buildings or

339
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:21,060
graffiti or art and to share it online

340
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,110
some countries in the European Union

341
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,930
don't yet have that such as France and

342
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,660
it's quite scattered depending on which

343
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,910
building and which kind of art across

344
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,279
the EU so we were we were of course

345
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,430
pushing for that as well that would be

346
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,500
great if that was included and if you

347
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,089
know in an event if it comes up of

348
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,380
course like that will be something we

349
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,350
would talk about um Wikimedia is also

350
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,950
still very focused on this but yeah so I

351
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,050
think for the next round we want to know

352
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,600
that we have actual tangible proposal

353
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,450
that ranges from threats that are very

354
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,990
very very serious threats to you know

355
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,640
thinking about how we can improve it I

356
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,950
think most likely our campaign and our

357
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,390
engagement with the community and those

358
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,490
events will focus on those those four

359
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,250
areas but we're very flexible I mean

360
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,079
we'll be working with there's like

361
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,890
there's a different range of

362
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,119
stakeholders who were working with right

363
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,400
so there's like the communion network

364
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,059
that focuses a lot on education which is

365
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,589
another exception that could be improved

366
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,260
so we this is also something that we

367
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,319
would support in the science community

368
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,449
it would be maybe more about text and

369
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,640
data mining with startups it might be

370
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,530
more about a UGC exception or fair use

371
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,840
or fair dealing so I think it's more

372
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,010
broad but just for

373
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,320
us and certainly the advocacy that I'm

374
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,330
doing in Brussels is really kind of

375
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,620
narrowed on that but I think for our

376
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,010
events it's very open yes and then sorry

377
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:57,630
what were you first he's okay Ania yes

378
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,900
definitely so we have so there's a

379
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,240
number of large associations that are

380
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,040
working on copyright that of course we

381
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,540
all have our sort of different

382
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,190
perspectives and approached these issues

383
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,740
from from a different angle we all more

384
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,630
or less want the same thing which is a

385
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,549
modern copyright reform that actually

386
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,650
looks forward to the 21st century and

387
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,030
not backwards

388
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,630
so there is an OLE ition called the c 4c

389
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,160
the copyright for creativity and this is

390
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,309
a kind of umbrella platform basically

391
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,390
which brings together some companies

392
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,330
like C CIA is a member but also the you

393
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,490
know digital rights NGOs like edgy and

394
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,480
open rights group the libraries all

395
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,160
sorts of different players so we

396
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,620
actually use that as a kind of

397
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,140
coordinating tool to work together and

398
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,600
so we don't always necessarily do like

399
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,720
joint campaigns necessarily but we're

400
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,820
all certainly talking I think those that

401
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,160
are interested in actually getting

402
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,470
better copyright reform a lot of people

403
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,260
have the same similar issues and so we

404
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,400
tried to work together as much as

405
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,620
possible and to amplify certain voices

406
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,790
and to support others wherever we can

407
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,790
yes

408
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,650
so the thing about you policymaking so

409
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,680
the question was should we do or what is

410
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,060
the purpose of doing another wave and

411
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,190
are we basically starting over and yeah

412
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,800
so the thing about you policymaking is

413
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,050
that it is a very very slow game so this

414
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,930
legislation has been or this potential

415
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,580
reform has been under discussion for

416
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,950
over five years and now that we have a

417
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,590
directive the whole process of it going

418
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,930
through the European Parliament going

419
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,820
through the council and then coming

420
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,830
together with the Commission and the

421
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,630
Parliament and the council and to

422
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,030
negotiate a final agreement by the time

423
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,310
we get done with that it's it's at least

424
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,220
a year so I think that the European

425
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,750
Parliament wants to finish this by the

426
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,510
end of 2017 I think it will be very

427
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,760
difficult to do that but so to answer

428
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,070
your question it's just to say if we

429
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,580
want to really have an impact and

430
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,340
mobilize especially different voices to

431
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,150
add to this campaign it has to be a kind

432
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,900
of sustained long-term effort and so in

433
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,790
the first wave it was more I would say

434
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,410
because we didn't have the proposal yet

435
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,050
it was more of like hey we're working on

436
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,820
copyright this is important and this is

437
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,250
how it impacts you now that we have a

438
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,660
proposal we want to kind of take it to

439
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,480
the next level to say hey this is what

440
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,980
we're working on this is what the

441
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,480
directive says this is how it needs to

442
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,030
be fixed and here's how your voice can

443
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,580
matter and so finding ways for instance

444
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,790
like to get those communities to take

445
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,610
the next step and to actually contact

446
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,320
their members of European Parliament or

447
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,540
even to contact people in their own

448
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,810
government these are I think like

449
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,940
potentially game-changing elements

450
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,160
because once especially elected

451
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,230
officials they hear from people who vote

452
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,450
for them trust me they change their mind

453
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,520
they really really do

454
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,860
and so I think that that's kind of our

455
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,540
thinking of doing a second wave of

456
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,070
mobilization and we'll do a third wave -

457
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,070
yes

458
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,870
okay thank you two great questions one

459
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,700
was on another exception that it didn't

460
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,730
cover on education and two was on a

461
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,830
little bit more details on the process

462
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,750
in the European Parliament so first on

463
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,690
the education exception yes it does

464
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,399
concern us it current it concerns

465
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,799
everyone and we we definitely want to

466
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,049
work especially with our partners in the

467
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,590
community association to to make that

468
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,399
exception better basically what the

469
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,380
exception does is like the text and data

470
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,029
mining exception it's like yay great

471
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,679
they're proposing an exception to be

472
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,389
harmonized in the EU which is a good

473
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:19,929
step for education great step but the

474
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,889
exception is only limited to where

475
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:27,990
licensed materials cannot be acquired so

476
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,169
that means that if you're a school or an

477
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,710
education institution if you can buy the

478
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,509
copyrighted works then you will not

479
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:40,389
apply to the exception which isn't

480
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,429
really addressing the problem my husband

481
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,889
is a teacher in Belgium and I can tell

482
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,509
you the problem is not finding licensed

483
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:46,870
works

484
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,570
the problem is absolutely the cost and

485
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,480
and the the the legal uncertainty of

486
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,669
like what kind of snippet or what size

487
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,559
of the copyrighted work you're allowed

488
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,559
to share with your classroom so we and

489
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:02,519
then it also does limit it to two

490
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:05,110
schools I guess in a sense that doesn't

491
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,669
take account for the different ways the

492
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:10,809
education is actually acquired like long

493
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:13,029
time learning like even doing you know

494
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:16,360
the education stuff that we do so yes we

495
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,769
would like to see that extended the

496
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:19,360
community at work I believe they have

497
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,950
launched a campaign now it's called

498
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,169
copyright for education work and so this

499
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:27,909
is also something that I will be doing

500
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:30,129
an event actually in kennis land with

501
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:32,080
one of the community members in

502
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,690
Amsterdam at the end of this month that

503
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,490
will focus on education so it's

504
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,870
certainly something that we are

505
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,809
following very closely and we're mostly

506
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,730
leaning on our partners who are like

507
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,919
experts in this area to make sure that

508
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,409
that exception is broadened as well so

509
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:49,720
it's useful to everyone and then the

510
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,580
second question on the process

511
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,290
so it's being negotiated in the European

512
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,110
Parliament right now there's a bunch of

513
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,190
different committees that are

514
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,400
formulating opinions on it right now

515
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,650
this is actually the best time because

516
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,290
the groups are right or just at the end

517
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,720
of their kind of like digestive period

518
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
of coming up with their group positions

519
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,040
so group positions haven't completely

520
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,140
solidified which means that talking to

521
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,700
them and reaching out and saying hey I

522
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,380
care about this or this should be this

523
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,390
way is a really good time to influence

524
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,870
them there will be votes on those

525
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,650
committee opinions next month but then

526
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,500
the main opinion and I can if anyone is

527
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,510
so inclined come and talk to me after

528
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,300
and I can link you to like there's more

529
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,160
detailed timelines but yeah I mean the

530
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,230
the main committee opinion will be

531
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,360
deliberated in March and I think they

532
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,880
want it to be voted by end of summer

533
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,040
like June July but it might actually be

534
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,350
September so it's possible that this

535
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,880
could actually you know the next six

536
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,570
months will be game-changing for 4th for

537
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,760
what we actually get in this reform but

538
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,290
then after the parliament comes up with

539
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,050
its position it's still the council

540
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,630
still has to come up with their position

541
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,710
so it's happening there's like two

542
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,680
negotiation tracks happening in parallel

543
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,030
the Parliament is easier to get to

544
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,440
because they are an elected and

545
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,990
institution the council which is the

546
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,850
collection of member states a little bit

547
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,850
harder because they're not elected and

548
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,350
their positions are normally more

549
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,570
entrenched which is why actually we're

550
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,970
focusing on the movement building piece

551
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,250
of bringing people and mobilizing people

552
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,110
inside of their country because that

553
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,190
makes a difference if people are in

554
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,810
Spain and Italy and Germany and France

555
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,330
etc are talking about copyright reform

556
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,490
and want better reformed and this will

557
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,350
actually change the dynamic hopefully in

558
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,240
the council as well as the European

559
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,900
Parliament

560
00:26:51,830 --> 00:27:54,169
I wouldn't like anyone mining that data

561
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,909
but okay so that's a great question

562
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,179
about text and data mining whether or

563
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,850
not it would actually implicate privacy

564
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,049
concerns

565
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,210
so that's a good distinction because

566
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,860
when I first got into this and I heard

567
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,330
text and data mining I was like what I

568
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,940
don't want to enable data mining to

569
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,570
everyone but this does not this is this

570
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,450
does not deal with privacy protected

571
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,299
content so the ability to actually I

572
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,700
know the word mine is is confusing

573
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,500
because we also say like mining and

574
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,360
harvesting of data and then text and

575
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,529
data mining but these are actually

576
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,120
separate concepts the text and data

577
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,139
mining exception that we're talking

578
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:32,720
about here would basically allow people

579
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,389
that have lawfully acquired works like

580
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:39,139
text like let's say a whole bunch of

581
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:42,200
research on AI to be able to read it

582
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,419
like this and to find these statistics

583
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:46,399
and to make a graph like a visualization

584
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,840
The Guardian

585
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,549
for instance and lots of journalists use

586
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,679
this as a way of looking through text

587
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,690
and coming up with visualizations so

588
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,730
this is all on like lawfully like

589
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,149
legally acquired work like text and not

590
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:01,279
about getting into privacy issues about

591
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,889
you know breaking into backdoors and and

592
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,269
mining people's metadata or anything

593
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:09,929
that so it's a separate thing from the

594
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:12,349
privacy and security and data protection

595
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:16,789
that we have and it wouldn't override it

596
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,580
more questions or you guys guys done for

597
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,459
going with copyright it's past 7:00 oh

598
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,769
my gosh okay all right okay well thank

599
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:32,479
you so much for for being so engaging

600
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,209
[Applause]
