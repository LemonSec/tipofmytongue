1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,630
personally outdoors okay it's said that

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,430
its size for allies to talk about that

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:31,740
get zkv badly Katie because it's alright

4
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,489
okay so but first of all let me

5
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,630
introduce myself

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,710
a little bit work those who just know

7
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,899
that I am the guy who talks about the

8
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:53,500
slim book

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,839
my name is yeah if you cannot hear me

10
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,940
just wave like that I will take it as a

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,030
sign my name is Alice Paul I come from

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,370
Barcelona and I've been developing Katie

13
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,500
for for a while now actually this

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,060
February it's 10 years I work for the

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,909
systems where we do caddy stuff and but

16
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,950
other things as well but mostly kitty

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,520
kitty software and things around kitty

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,360
distros and so on and I'm also part of

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,850
the KDP board if anybody has a question

20
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,939
about kdv things we can discuss them

21
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,990
later outside if you're interested and

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,219
one of the things I've been working on

23
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,950
on my free time because I also do kiddie

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,750
on my free time like my life is about

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,619
Katie nowadays is flat-pack and snappy

26
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,509
tooling and things and that's what I

27
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,180
wanted to talk about today so before

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,299
getting into the into the subject head

29
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,310
start I wanted to talk about the

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,740
motivation like why would they be

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,729
interested in these systems maybe it's

32
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,070
something obvious maybe it's not so

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,250
before I say anything who things here

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,020
that it's obvious that Katie should be

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,560
doing but container stuff

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,520
okay so for the record it's about 20% of

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,190
the room we've been doing software in

38
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,870
KDE for 20 years now and in Katy we have

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,200
a vocation for the end user what we do

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,420
in KDE is we make software so that

41
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,550
people will be using them on their

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,890
laptops and we'll be using their more

43
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,800
their phones on some occasions and and

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,570
so on historically we've done that

45
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,620
through mostly through the distribution

46
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,060
kind of system where we basically

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,470
publish a turbo file with full of text

48
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,680
files most of them while C++ source code

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,470
but not exclusively of course and images

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,600
and a lot of stuff and then there's

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,840
other people who build those that's only

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,209
for Linux in fact in KDE we do other

53
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,580
things as well in khaidi we have some of

54
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,200
our software works on Windows some of

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,569
our summer works on OSX and on Android

56
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,780
and in some occasions some even more

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,110
marginal architectures and and we've

58
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,709
done all of that work because our in one

59
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,810
of the important things for us is to

60
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,970
make free software for people to use in

61
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,340
their daily lives and and to be able to

62
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,230
enjoy the tools and from my point of

63
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,280
view which is not a widely shared one

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,079
we've had a problem there which has been

65
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,810
that sometimes our users haven't had the

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,340
our latest developments and this has

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,019
been a bad thing this has been a bad

68
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,130
thing because whenever we release the

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,200
software we consider that stable right

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,180
and if there's a problem with that so

71
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,220
for what we do is we fix it and we make

72
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,079
another release if the users are not

73
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,870
getting this new release the these users

74
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,380
are what handicapped on on on our

75
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,200
software and it's really frustrating for

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,620
our developers to not be able to fix the

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,050
issues and that that's something that

78
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,280
the system's try to solve so Pat was

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,450
telling me now that he's not

80
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,750
super sure about what these systems do

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,520
so I will try to summarize it a little

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,290
bit both flat back and snappy are well

83
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,030
essentially very similar they do have

84
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,580
some differences but in general what the

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,400
the opportunity they offer is to be able

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,020
to distribute applications like compiled

87
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,850
application that people will be able to

88
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,560
use both of them offered the possibility

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,600
to execute those applications in a

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,800
sandbox environment which improves the

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,880
the security and facilities for for the

92
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,600
user to to adopt those systems and all

93
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,610
those applications and what that's more

94
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,430
or less the idea is there somebody who

95
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,230
still thinks it doesn't understand what

96
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,740
they do I know my definition was not

97
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,550
great but well if there's doubts I can

98
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,180
try harder

99
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,960
well the difference is that they're

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,550
developed by different people at

101
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,150
different moments in their lives so well

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,590
while they were trying to solve the same

103
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,230
problem somehow well they had different

104
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,370
priorities at their moment and different

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,580
things from very high level point of

106
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,610
view I would say that flat-pack is far

107
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,940
more focused to desktop applications

108
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,510
that a difference the earth difference

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,250
is that the model of this distribution

110
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,180
snappy has a centralized repository by

111
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,470
like by canonical or Ubuntu scroll store

112
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,140
that ubuntu.com and you will fetch from

113
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,240
there flatpack expects everyone to have

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,220
their own repositories or at least it

115
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,980
has been like that for a while they also

116
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,260
have thoughts of centralizing it another

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,820
very interesting thing from us that

118
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,040
we're looking at both is that they are

119
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
kind of converging into doing the same

120
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,110
things like one started from one end and

121
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,970
the other started from the other and

122
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,590
they were both very convinced but then

123
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,790
you see how they start to convert and go

124
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,240
the similar directions I think it's it's

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
important to understand when talking

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
about this is that these technologies

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,770
are not super mature they're ready to be

128
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,440
used and and they do things like we will

129
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,950
see hands-on how it's working today

130
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,180
already but that doesn't mean that in 1

131
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,430
2 years there will be exactly the same

132
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,130
as they are right now already flatback

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,600
for example they had an LPS release some

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,780
some weeks ago but I am confident that

135
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,880
we will see still some development and

136
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,860
improving on the on the platforms

137
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,490
together but that's more or less what I

138
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,310
wanted to say so in general for us is to

139
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,260
have the possibility to like when we

140
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,120
have a new release of the application to

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,850
be able to put it on on on our user

142
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,720
hands one example that that we use to

143
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,790
explain this in k develop is that many

144
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,840
of our users for example are on

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,450
universities universities the systems

146
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,450
over there are managed by system

147
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,300
administrators and one thing I've always

148
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,370
heard from this kind of people is that

149
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,560
they tell us what will you think these

150
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,010
the software from five to ten years ago

151
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,470
which I understand it's it makes sense

152
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,840
for for what these systems to use very

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,260
stable places or what I wouldn't call

154
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,099
them stable but well it's the common

155
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,809
mindshare nowadays is that all software

156
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,280
means stable right but for us when we

157
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,110
make a new release with new features we

158
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,030
want to tell these people well use the

159
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,250
new thing we are doing right because we

160
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,590
actually make fixes and we actually work

161
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,900
on new useful features but if these

162
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,690
people they cannot use this software

163
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,089
then well we still have some slightly

164
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,060
unhappy users that we won't be able to

165
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,810
make happy up until five years in the

166
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,000
future when the design means decided to

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,980
brought new versions of everything and

168
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,540
when they do they will do it on all

169
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,520
software at that point and it makes

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,410
sense like for kernels it make sense for

171
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,690
even desktop impairments possibly maybe

172
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,730
actually I don't really think so but

173
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,760
maybe but it doesn't make sense for K

174
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,020
develop right it doesn't make sense for

175
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,940
Kate it doesn't make sense for liberal

176
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,660
office I would say if the developers say

177
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,750
this release is table then this release

178
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,220
is a stable one and if somebody

179
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,930
disagrees we can have a conversation on

180
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,030
the question rounds later I think it

181
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,860
will be interesting but ask ad what have

182
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,290
we done so how does that but you realize

183
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,780
I guess that if you asked a normal

184
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,060
person they will tell you while we've

185
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,610
developed most of flat-pack together

186
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,580
with red hat so but that will be their

187
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,290
answer we haven't developed that but we

188
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,709
haven't developed a snap although some

189
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:13,670
of our developers

190
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,870
we'll have patches on either platform

191
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,460
but what we have done is we start to be

192
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,890
on both platforms because we also see

193
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,140
that there's none of them that is 100%

194
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,790
what we want or that we think that what

195
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,340
we all we will have users on both

196
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,870
platforms are red so we need to be on

197
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,050
both in any case so it's still not up to

198
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:42,530
us to decide what work to be so we've in

199
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,750
packaging applications that doesn't mean

200
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,730
it's been exclusively applications but

201
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,180
it's been mostly applications

202
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,240
applications is so if you are on wound

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,190
to normal unity you will be able to

204
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,470
insult Kate on on it and it will make

205
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,230
sense if you're using fedora you will be

206
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,320
able to also use Kate on it and the one

207
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,560
coming from us which is the one we are

208
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,070
well on top of so now I will go through

209
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,440
all aspects of both and and with what

210
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,960
we've done on it I will start with how

211
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,270
would you install applications then I

212
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,470
will go through how to build

213
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,200
applications KT applications on those

214
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,020
platforms and then I will show you how

215
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,720
we are integrating those platforms into

216
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,310
our Software Center

217
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,050
I hope that's interesting for you I

218
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,700
think it's really cool but then after

219
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,080
most of the work so I'm not really

220
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,180
representative how do you to install a

221
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,610
snap well there's two things that you

222
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,220
want to install thank you we have this

223
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,100
thing which is our frameworks we also

224
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,380
all of our applications rely on cute

225
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,080
which is a fairly big package so we

226
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,530
needed to at least share of one of those

227
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,970
many of the complaints of I here

228
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,940
whenever somebody talks to me about

229
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,810
bundled applications is

230
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,089
how every application is is while

231
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,250
packaging all of all of the libraries

232
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,760
and well it's certainly something we

233
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,020
didn't want we don't want every KD

234
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,430
maintainer to have to maintain the

235
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,190
compilations of all cute and of all okay

236
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,320
d frameworks that's definitely something

237
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,110
crazy and of course every time somebody

238
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,970
downloads an application we don't want

239
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,710
them to download all of kids and all of

240
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,010
KD frameworks because that's what tens

241
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,010
to hundreds of megabytes that's not

242
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,700
acceptable

243
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,070
but then for us we consider it's

244
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,650
acceptable to have a big package which

245
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,270
would be the frameworks package which

246
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,089
has all of huge it has all of the KD

247
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,020
frameworks and then have well tens to

248
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,620
hundreds of smaller applications to that

249
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,890
you can download and enjoy and have them

250
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,670
all sharing this these big frameworks

251
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,210
package so if you want to read more

252
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,900
about that there's Harold's blog which

253
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,260
explains a bit how its installed

254
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,520
do we want to insert our application

255
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,029
sorry

256
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,370
- gay this ten or is it like it is it

257
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,590
version or is it like the way Darrell

258
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,680
whenever there's a new version oh yes

259
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,360
the question is do we have to have

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,820
installed many frameworks packages all

261
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,000
the time time and I would say no no well

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,130
in both enqueued and KD frameworks we we

263
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,550
offer backwards api compatibility so any

264
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,440
new work package would would work with

265
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,200
an older world which shouldn't be a

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,080
problem for us there's of course the

267
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,840
possibility to do it it's not something

268
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,210
we're very interested actually our

269
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,520
interest is that people only has this

270
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,380
one and to have to maintain this one

271
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,770
right so and we don't want to have to

272
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,910
maintain different versions of

273
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,860
frameworks or anything like that like

274
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,830
have to be revealed when SSL changes or

275
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,980
whatever so yeah that's one thing and

276
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,390
then to build those Maps I will go

277
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,570
through more or less what the manifest

278
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,760
file looks like I will try to go very

279
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,260
fast because I don't think it's super

280
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,390
interesting but I still wanted to to

281
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,110
look into it

282
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,890
first I want to show you the repository

283
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,830
or lost the mouse the repository we have

284
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,800
four manifest files so the idea is that

285
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,600
while not all of the applications are

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,460
here because in KDE we have more than

287
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,900
three those three we want application

288
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,730
maintain years to maintain their

289
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,400
manifest files somehow so that they get

290
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,570
to decide when they want a new

291
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,370
dependency or they don't want it they

292
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,140
get to modify it and have the

293
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,520
application compiled like that we are

294
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,650
still beginning with we're starting and

295
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,009
actually what we're doing nowadays is

296
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,750
using the neon packaging for creating

297
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,980
the snaps which is basically magic hard

298
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,790
worked on and it allows us to have

299
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,899
virtually any key application available

300
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,209
like right now not in some months but

301
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,980
now which is something we welcome so

302
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,930
that's more or less how it works so on

303
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,810
the manifest file what we specify is

304
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,269
well names and how we want the

305
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,519
application to be confined so the the

306
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,290
information we have on the manifest is

307
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,139
more or less the information that snap

308
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,480
the snap system will have of our

309
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,209
application one once it's running right

310
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,540
so there's name version summaries for

311
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,069
because snap is also at the moment the

312
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:29,310
system snappy your users for for listing

313
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,689
applications and showing them on our

314
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:35,910
software Center also we need to tell it

315
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,569
what kind of things our snap will be

316
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,069
doing to communicate with the external

317
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,870
world right this is those plugs if I say

318
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,189
something really wrong tell me

319
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:07,910
I am NOT an expert but the idea is that

320
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,010
you request these plugs and then the

321
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,930
system provides you with the other

322
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,579
things so it's a modular system but

323
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,210
there's snap developers over here so

324
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,599
what you can find them and then ask them

325
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,430
these questions also Jara will be able

326
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,440
to answer you these questions better but

327
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,930
more or less here the idea is that here

328
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,520
for example we're saying we need unity

329
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,230
seven and it says here notifications

330
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,780
well but Harold man when he brought that

331
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,390
is that you need to have somebody

332
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,530
listening to you on that and so when you

333
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,070
edit things

334
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,560
well these notifications happen on the

335
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,900
on the system side right because if it's

336
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,660
confined and nobody gets to listen to

337
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,880
your application then you can send

338
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,350
notifications but they don't want show

339
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:04,010
on on the on the system right and then

340
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:10,430
that exposing the KD frameworks package

341
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,370
on so when our application is compiled

342
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,920
is using the shared frameworks thing on

343
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,220
the on the build time

344
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,260
but no we want distribute unity with

345
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,190
every KD application a Chester name that

346
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,120
they used for for naming some interfaces

347
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,610
and think about it as a permission

348
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,140
system you're basically requesting

349
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,520
permission to talk to you what you said

350
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,850
let's

351
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,490
so Harold suggested for the microphone

352
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,220
that it's you can think of it as a

353
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:23,810
permission system so there's this part

354
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,500
which hardly can you explain it you will

355
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:35,480
do it to quickly answer the question the

356
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,890
way you would do it right now is

357
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,020
probably through a different package

358
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,440
name

359
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:48,740
so you've you've seen how the the thing

360
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,290
is called Kitty frame X - 5 right so if

361
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,820
you wanted a version it would be - five

362
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,280
point six right now I don't think you

363
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,060
can actually lock it on versions there

364
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,070
is no way not right now anyway so you

365
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,900
would have to do this way through

366
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,220
through the separate package

367
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,940
but beyond that there's no way

368
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,050
essentially the idea would be that you

369
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,240
will always have the latest framework

370
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,840
version right what's the what's the

371
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,580
point of compiling against an older

372
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:31,160
version if you see it failing then you

373
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,050
will change your channel into a newer

374
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,240
one and then it should work

375
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,270
yeah all right there's an hour question

376
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,020
I think you should really ask canonical

377
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,840
people to give you a snappy presentation

378
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,210
I think it would be great for Wordsworth

379
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,320
I'm not a flatback expert either so

380
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,520
maybe this will be a horrible position

381
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,220
anyways what we do on on plat back you

382
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,740
will see is it's very similar like I

383
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,920
said on on snappy the the repositories

384
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,600
are centralized that's why you just

385
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,360
install things here we need to add the

386
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,040
repositories with with things as well

387
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,850
what we see here is that we are adding

388
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,830
ikd remote then adding installing the

389
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,250
platform file from it and then you add

390
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,110
another remote which is the repository

391
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,480
we have for applications and then we

392
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,070
install an application which in this

393
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:50,870
case is ocular yeah we have a wiki you

394
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,730
can look at well and what you will see

395
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,690
all of the information there so as you

396
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,580
can see here we have more or less the

397
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,000
same structure we had on unsnap we have

398
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,880
the the platform with all of cute and KD

399
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,860
frameworks and some integration packages

400
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,210
and then we have the application

401
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,880
elsewhere with only the what the

402
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,800
application itself and other libraries

403
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,540
that will not be on the on the platform

404
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,180
like ocular in this case it has poplar

405
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,000
which is the library they used to render

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,080
PDF files and so on so also flat-pack

407
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,929
has a technology to talk to the outside

408
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,390
beyond the similar system that snap has

409
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,510
with with the plugs it also has the

410
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,340
portals which basically are standard

411
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,370
interfaces that are present on flat pack

412
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,140
as a platform so that you can request

413
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,380
things so for example the normal open

414
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,480
file dialog you will instead of

415
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,430
implementing it inside of the

416
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,760
application you can request for full

417
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,770
file system access what you do is you

418
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,220
just make a flat back call to the flat

419
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,640
work portal and then flat back will do

420
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,930
the file navigation with all of the

421
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,670
privileges available and then give you

422
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,840
the file somehow and what we do have

423
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
some implementation of it you can look

424
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,740
at this blog later and you will see

425
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,790
what's what and then well the common to

426
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,250
build an application is this one in in

427
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,230
flat pack you need to install the SDK

428
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,720
which is basically the header libraries

429
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,930
that are required and some compiler

430
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,860
stuff and then run this beautiful line

431
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,040
that didn't fit on the screen

432
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,770
this is what manifest file looks like

433
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,660
for flat pack why are you basically what

434
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,780
you say which is your runtime which are

435
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,480
the things you need from the outside and

436
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,850
then the libraries you might need and

437
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,150
then the application and then you

438
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,280
compile it now it might be a good moment

439
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,980
to look at an application open on those

440
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,640
platforms let's let's see if I can do it

441
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,180
we thought without messing up so much

442
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:44,690
so we can flat so the applications

443
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,330
repository we have for flat-pack is

444
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,760
actually quite new I uploaded it for the

445
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,980
first time on Thursday but we've been

446
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,270
working on the applications for a while

447
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,350
these are the applications we have

448
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:10,790
packets nowadays we can install one what

449
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:17,330
we need to tell it repository and now of

450
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,040
course you need to install it or where

451
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,050
it's already installed you can believe

452
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,230
it works I didn't make flat pack though

453
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:33,040
and that's ocular being run in flat back

454
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,410
this is not running the the portals yet

455
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,470
it's just requesting the access to the

456
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,470
full file system but then you can see if

457
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,500
we go up here there is an app directory

458
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,690
which is actually where the application

459
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,790
is mounted so this is not the root

460
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,130
filesystem of my system it's just the

461
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,880
mounted system on on on flat pack on

462
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,580
snappy let's see what snubs I have

463
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,590
installed because we don't have a lot of

464
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,860
time

465
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,970
[Music]

466
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,800
we can run scummvm who doesn't love

467
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:17,169
scummvm boom oops

468
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,520
okay now notice when I work you stop run

469
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,229
oh yeah there it is

470
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:51,740
yeah no that's not super I should have

471
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,750
al Qaeda application which one key

472
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:00,260
blocks key blocks pseudo right so though

473
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:06,850
it's not in stock blocks

474
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,760
this is on our application single game

475
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,279
and then I could can play here it's

476
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,250
awesome

477
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:34,580
now you can applaud sake then we

478
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,140
can look at the Supercenter integration

479
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,730
we will look first at discover because

480
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,140
it's the one I did I will open it with

481
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:52,399
just the snapback end because well then

482
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,429
it's easier I would have installed the

483
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,409
application which one which application

484
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,220
we have as well

485
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,309
we have ocular ocular yeah EULA you open

486
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:12,230
it instead then we wait you don't have

487
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,070
progress that's great but while it

488
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,039
installs we can because we don't have a

489
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,899
lot of time we can look at the video

490
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,590
Yan from Red Hat dates with the

491
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,490
integration for on flat pack for

492
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,179
discover for flat back

493
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,790
you can see it work it's on on a brand

494
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,320
and it's actually not compatible with

495
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,990
master so I don't really want to install

496
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,100
it now but you can see listing works and

497
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,830
you get to launch the application

498
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:08,190
huzzah and well let's see if ocular

499
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,400
words installed or I still have console

500
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,489
[Music]

501
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:31,680
to be compiled so that's that's it there

502
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,030
you go so I wanted to discuss a bit

503
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,400
future things which is basically we

504
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,170
would like to have it better integrated

505
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,340
in key develop which what should happen

506
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,590
soon if we find somebody to do it if

507
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,790
you're interested please say hi we would

508
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,570
like to see if how hard it would be to

509
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,210
have plasma on those systems as well we

510
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,150
have two approaches to it none of them

511
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,640
work but we're hopeful they might

512
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,330
someday and you have maybe half a minute

513
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,290
for a question

514
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:18,980
[Applause]

515
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:24,900
where do you see the met the main use of

516
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:34,390
these these two ways of delivering well

517
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,390
Kady is not software Kady is a community

518
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,570
right plasma though is usually bundled

519
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,520
on with the system it's something you

520
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,360
might still get with your distribution

521
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,880
but that's not necessarily what will

522
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,690
happen in 20 years
