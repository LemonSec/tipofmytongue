1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,709
oh hi thank you for showing

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,350
up in such big numbers I hope I can

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,820
bring something interesting to you I

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,010
don't know who here is really familiar

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,080
with graphs like who's working with them

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,080
like all the time okay so there's a lot

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,550
of people are just coming to check it

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,190
out learn a bit more about graphs that

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,050
don't really like you know that still

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,200
have to get started okay so especially

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,910
people that are more experienced I would

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,260
love to hear your feedback after this

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,480
talk because I'm pulling some rabbits

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,690
out of my hat and so now yeah and I

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,300
myself I'm not very familiar with graphs

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,219
we're kind of exploring what are the

17
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,429
possibilities and this talk will be

18
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:44,140
about data exploration that we've been

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,510
doing so originally this stock was going

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,300
to be about putting graph databases into

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,079
popular open source CMS's and like

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,370
because that was kind of like the most

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,799
obvious thing to do but then we thought

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,510
a bit more about it and we came up with

25
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,839
two more use cases that I've shortened

26
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:04,089
talk about also during the talk and

27
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:05,979
that's why I changed the title to graph

28
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,380
databases and CMS's rather than graph

29
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,610
databases in CMS's first short

30
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,649
introduction I'm Christopher Thoma

31
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,649
I'm a Belgian half Hungarian by now

32
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,820
almost because I run a business in

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,640
Hungary we are specialized in developer

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,109
portals so we do documentation systems

35
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,579
like I roam several open source

36
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,250
communities including Drupal the

37
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,439
developer evangelist DITA is not open

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,420
source but open standards and the writer

39
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,270
Docs communities if you know right if

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,609
you're if you're interested and excited

41
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,950
about documentation you need to go and

42
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,450
check out write the docs it's an awesome

43
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,549
community but it's another thing and

44
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,189
those are our partners so we specialize

45
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,880
in in developer portals for api's now

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,170
what does that have to do with graphs

47
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,240
and and why are we interested in graphs

48
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,859
we're really excited about personalized

49
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:07,170
help to keep it very short currently

50
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,520
documentation works like a manual it's

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,740
like a book we've taken the concept of a

52
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,870
book and we've put it online and you can

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,420
go and find individual pages but it's

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,020
still following this book structure

55
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,980
and and I think it's time to change that

56
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,520
you see already like a move towards

57
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,750
information as flows rather than books

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,910
and I think that's also going to happen

59
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,250
with documentation what I imagine that

60
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,230
in the future documentation will be in

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,930
the context of one person so that you

62
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,720
get personalized help based on what

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,670
you've been doing in a system and how

64
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,930
you've been interacting and what

65
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,820
information you already know and the

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,070
system knows that you already know so

67
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,260
that's how we got interested in neo4j

68
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,250
and graph databases because to do that's

69
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,790
kind of like one-to-one personalization

70
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,900
it's rather hearts in in standard

71
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,430
databases and that's why we got excited

72
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,580
about graph databases like I don't know

73
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,410
if you like this is the evil empire

74
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,290
right the personalized marketing we

75
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,260
believe that there's a more benign

76
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,700
version of that where you do

77
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,530
personalized documentation where you

78
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,750
kind of like get a personal assistant

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,490
that tells you like Oh looks like you

80
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,350
haven't used this feature yet and this

81
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,760
looks like something you might actually

82
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,800
want to use so maybe you want to read

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,390
this little blurb of documentation here

84
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,080
so and the ideas that's you would be

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
able to recognize when people get

86
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,710
frustrated based on their behavior and

87
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,570
then serve them the right content at the

88
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,990
right time so and that's that's with

89
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,880
that initial idea like I had been

90
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,150
meeting Michael at a few events I think

91
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,750
at CLS in the US the first time and then

92
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,420
we had been talking a few years ago one

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,580
of our colleagues had gotten excited

94
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,290
about graph databases and he actually

95
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,270
built a module for Drupal that's the CMS

96
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,170
we work in and but I didn't get it so he

97
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,200
built this module it's you know he's a

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,940
really good developer so it was good

99
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,190
code and but it didn't get any lags

100
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,140
because nobody was really using it

101
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,400
because they didn't really understand

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
what you could use it for so and then

103
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,720
once we got this personalization use

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,579
case I started thinking more about it's

105
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,620
talking with Michael and in the end we

106
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,930
decided to build a new module together

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,260
with tomash and the idea there was to

108
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,650
just capture information from the CMS

109
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,320
and start storing it in a graph database

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,729
so that we can then do queries

111
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,879
it's and and start serving comment later

112
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,249
and and the initial idea was like so you

113
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:39,289
know what can you use this for well you

114
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,080
could use it to explore large

115
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,059
non-uniform data sets so if you you know

116
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:45,589
you just get a whole bunch of data and

117
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,680
information and you it's not really

118
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,969
structured and you want to start

119
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,889
exploring it and getting structure out

120
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:52,849
of it

121
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,620
you could use it to recommence contents

122
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,039
this is also a very common use case in

123
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,259
CMS's for sure for example there's a

124
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,620
news organizations that are using graph

125
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,830
databases like neo4j in particular to

126
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,449
recommend content based on what you're

127
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,599
looking at and then the last one is like

128
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,710
personalization and I think that's time

129
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:32,509
for tomash is demo so this demo will

130
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,289
show the yeah so this time of your show

131
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,520
the integration we did for Drupal one of

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,099
the Keating so first of all the module

133
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,129
exposes the neo4j client to Drupal

134
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,629
modules but the the part I will demo is

135
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:52,580
to use it with the module called rules

136
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,110
what rules does is that there are events

137
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,509
in the system and you can filter them

138
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,809
with a condition and then you can

139
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:06,800
execute actions and I created I created

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,849
an action which runs a cipher query and

141
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:13,759
the VI so I haven't although it would be

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,770
nicer to have some kind of visual query

143
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,439
builder but that would be a lot of work

144
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,699
so currently it's only I can only run a

145
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,749
simple query and this isn't this isn't a

146
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:31,550
complex query what it does is just it

147
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,789
that includes or just insert the data

148
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,059
into neo4j that says that a certain

149
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:42,439
person has visited a site and I also

150
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,029
made

151
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,360
touken system so in many places in

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,549
Drupal this token replacement system is

153
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,799
available which means that you can get

154
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,229
this context-sensitive tokens and I need

155
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:58,939
it work with with the graph car the

156
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,369
cycler query so basically if you run if

157
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,989
you're on a cypher query these are

158
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,999
available as parameters and you can see

159
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,729
that they're you you have a wide

160
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,429
selection of stuff like site data data

161
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,979
for the current page that you visit and

162
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,709
and many other things and what this

163
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,389
allows me to do is to basically build a

164
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,459
very simple recommendation system where

165
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,319
if you start visiting content on your

166
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,619
site then it will show up as a

167
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:37,099
recommendation and this small my you'll

168
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,709
basically this is this is the code that

169
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,709
displays a block and there's also very

170
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,399
simple query here that basically just

171
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,399
looks for content that are somewhere

172
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,369
during the in the database and source

173
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:55,189
them by basically that's just a very

174
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,059
simple metric that they are sorted by

175
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:03,619
the average size of the distance between

176
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:13,899
the two content yes I think somehow I

177
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,159
think the more interesting thing

178
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,519
probably is to show how how the data is

179
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,110
stored in the database maybe you can

180
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,239
show that you have the visualization yes

181
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,719
so

182
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,589
so this is basically the graph these are

183
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,250
the actual content that we have visited

184
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,860
these are the paths that what we have

185
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,140
visited there's another feature of the

186
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,080
module that logs these paths that you

187
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,750
have visited these are these Reds are

188
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,620
the actual visits and then this blue one

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:08,420
is the user so it's a very very basic

190
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,910
thing but I guess you see the fantasy of

191
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,000
it of the possibilities so you can just

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,810
squirrel away data using all this all

193
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,210
the tokens that are available in Drupal

194
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,580
or well I you know we're Drupal shop so

195
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,680
Drupal is our thing

196
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,460
but it's so you get all these all these

197
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,890
constant contacts things contextual

198
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,410
parameters from the system that you can

199
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,330
then add to your graph and do all kinds

200
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,640
of magic with and then run queries and

201
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,890
get information to do recommendation for

202
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,310
example now this was our first kind of

203
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,260
use case and this was the thing that was

204
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,990
the most obvious but there's there's

205
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,730
more and because we were like thinking

206
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,050
about this when we were brainstorming

207
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,390
about the session was like so but what

208
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,860
could you do if you combine the two

209
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,709
technologies rather than asking what if

210
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,870
you put a graph inside of a CMS we asked

211
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,279
like so what can you do when you combine

212
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,290
the technologies one of the first things

213
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,690
we thought about was this intersection

214
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,029
it's like putting a graph database as

215
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,940
your database for your CMS whether we

216
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,890
like immediately rejected that idea

217
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,070
because performance wise it would

218
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,950
probably be broader bads because also it

219
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,600
would require an enormous amount of work

220
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,150
to get that done so we kind of rejected

221
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,920
that the thing we didn't thought about

222
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
was the other the other thing so like

223
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,180
putting it putting a graph database

224
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,250
inside your CMS that's what we just

225
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,820
showed but what if you put a CMS as a

226
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,220
GUI in front of your graph database so

227
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,980
what if you use the CMS as it as a tool

228
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,180
that's that helps you to to make

229
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,300
graphs and I'll explain in a moment so

230
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
this is one of my skills that I've done

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,140
for a lot of api's it's like this idea

232
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,350
that's Drupal it's not just software

233
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,320
it's a whole ecosystem

234
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,060
everybody in is everybody familiar with

235
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,330
Drupal actually who doesn't know Drupal

236
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,950
ok there's something so drupal is an

237
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,660
open source content management system

238
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,800
it's built in PHP it's like WordPress

239
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,390
everybody knows it's kind of like

240
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,920
WordPress but a little bit more to say

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,210
WordPress is used for a lot of smaller

242
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,340
sites there's also bigger sites now but

243
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,360
Drupal is more the the craftsman tool

244
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,280
for building websites and you can build

245
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,680
very custom things and a whole bunch of

246
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,980
complex things and the cool thing about

247
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,320
Drupal is that it has this really big

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,690
ecosystem of people lots and lots of

249
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,550
developers that have built extensions

250
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,060
for it

251
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,580
for pretty much anything you can come up

252
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,740
with if there's a new interesting

253
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,020
exciting API coming out somebody will

254
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,130
build a module for it

255
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,900
and you can plug it into your site's

256
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,480
mileage may vary sometimes it won't work

257
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,300
sometimes it will work and you have a

258
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,770
big epic win so it allows you to to

259
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,690
really plug in into a whole ecosystem of

260
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,990
innovation that's expense with a bunch

261
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,760
of things for example the developer

262
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,590
portal said that we do what often

263
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,710
happens is that's some large corporates

264
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,440
they they need some special access

265
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,840
permission management they want single

266
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,770
sign-on to some specific software very

267
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,120
big chance that somebody already built

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,920
that module and built that connection

269
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,720
and that's that's kind of a really nice

270
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,030
nice thing so what what would it mean

271
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,710
like so if you think a little bit more

272
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,870
about it like if you would use a CMS as

273
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,360
a GUI for a graph database what could

274
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,240
that mean first of all I think you could

275
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,060
use it as a complete model builder so I

276
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,770
know that you can build console models

277
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,190
in graphs but the flexibility of graph

278
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,950
databases also makes it its weakness I

279
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,160
think because you you you're basically

280
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,640
unless

281
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,010
build a UI and you built a structured

282
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,720
model where you have to spend quite some

283
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,150
time building that model you can do

284
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,130
pretty much anything and one single typo

285
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,090
and you can have like a different field

286
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:19,190
that's yeah okay sorry yeah yeah please

287
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,950
do do interfere do you intervene if I'm

288
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,260
saying things you don't understand so

289
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,100
complete model is the idea that for

290
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,390
example company company name vit number

291
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,310
date of foundation company formats

292
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,410
founder and so on those are all fields

293
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,900
yeah the schema yeah so console model in

294
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,050
in CMS speak is the schema that you

295
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,730
build up so and making a structures and

296
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,000
enforcing a structured schema I think or

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,470
I imagine is potentially a problem I

298
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,120
think if you if you have a very flexible

299
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,120
interface with CMS's that's not the case

300
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,620
because you just get a form that you

301
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,540
have to fill in and you just fill in the

302
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,160
fields and it's automatically stored in

303
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,520
the right place so and I'll show you a

304
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,500
picture that will make it clear in a

305
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,190
moment the other thing is reports views

306
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,790
and reports builder I know that you can

307
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,530
get the data out of your database but

308
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,270
then how do you sort it how do you

309
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,850
format it how do you theme it's like how

310
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,550
or ham what about design elements do you

311
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,430
put to it how do you share it there's a

312
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,680
there's a bunch of complexities that you

313
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,980
get for visualizing information that has

314
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,050
been solved over and over and over again

315
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,750
for CMS's and that there's a very mature

316
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,960
tool tool sets that could be used from

317
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,800
the CMS space publishing do you want to

318
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,740
prevent access for specific types of

319
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,020
users and for other people not like do

320
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,700
you want to limit the access to some

321
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,320
online resource where you have your

322
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,180
reporting there's a there's a

323
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,950
integrations with other third-party

324
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,780
services like importing and exporting

325
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,120
content there's this whole space of

326
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,100
functionality that's already available

327
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,290
in the CMS space that could be plugged

328
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,760
in into into the graph system so for

329
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,350
example for comfort model

330
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,060
Drupal core has this fields system where

331
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,630
you can just like add a field and then

332
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,050
you you just select the type of fields I

333
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,000
know that's not readable but like you

334
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,150
got text and time and whatever dates and

335
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,930
and a bunch of other things that's you

336
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,120
can just use this graphical interface

337
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,980
for building your content model now I

338
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,140
know if your developer you don't need

339
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,720
this but if you're not a developer and

340
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
you have to interact with a graph

341
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,830
database this potentially I think could

342
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,020
be very very valuable for example this

343
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,970
showcase that's been used over and over

344
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,460
again about the Panama papers I think

345
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,340
that's giving journalists or other

346
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,990
people that are might not be developers

347
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,020
the power to model their information I

348
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,570
like and to enrich the information and

349
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,450
start structuring it using these

350
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,130
graphical tools that we've already built

351
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,130
in the CMS world might might be an

352
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:19,450
interesting win for data exploration so

353
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,220
yeah so enriching the data about

354
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,800
entities ensuring completeness that all

355
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,360
the fields are there that's also

356
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,130
something that's you know it's trivial

357
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,280
in in CMS's you have to program it in

358
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,610
your interface if you want to do that

359
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,960
where the graph database storage I

360
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,230
understand because um things like

361
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,720
sending a form to somebody to fill in

362
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,290
data that might be missing or and I

363
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,450
think that's what you could do is store

364
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,130
some of your information both in your

365
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,010
graph database and in your CMS so that

366
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,710
you use your relational database for

367
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,960
retrieving like the complete sets and

368
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,730
you use the graph database for figuring

369
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,960
out what are the links between a

370
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,410
difference entities so and and that's

371
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,050
also another thing like when you have a

372
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,459
system like that you can evolve your

373
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,280
content model just from the interface so

374
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,959
if you want to rename a field that is

375
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,449
possible and that's I think much harder

376
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,170
in in a graph database okay

377
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,550
so for example for reporting what you

378
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,750
could do this is a again very blurry

379
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,210
screenshot of the views module in Drupal

380
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,400
views is like a graphical interface for

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,620
building sequel queries in your poll and

382
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,770
then for massaging it so that it it

383
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,660
looks the way that you want it to look

384
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,060
so you want it in a table do you want it

385
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,490
just in a list do you want it in you do

386
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,590
you want your results in a grid all of

387
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,810
these things are possible using using

388
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,810
views just by clicking on on buttons and

389
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,400
dropdowns and stuff so yeah you can't

390
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
really see it here but but you you can

391
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,940
select what kind of content you would

392
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,910
you want to pull in and and so on so

393
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,220
what we imagine is that you could run a

394
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,240
cypher query and pull in the results get

395
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,960
the content IDs using the Safra query

396
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,070
and then using the CMS to pull all the

397
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,460
relational contents from your from your

398
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,740
sequel database get all that information

399
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:32,130
in that sorted and a format well sort it

400
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,920
formulates teammates using using the the

401
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,690
Drupal theming system so that it looks

402
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,030
nice potentially even export it's

403
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,830
there's a bunch of plugins for different

404
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,950
export formats restrict access and rich

405
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,740
data so that's yeah so things that you

406
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,280
can do is like filtering sorting adding

407
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,810
headers footers like all of this stuff

408
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,670
that's that's necessary in the CMS and

409
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,630
then there's like third-party

410
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,030
integrations Drupal has like when I've

411
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,950
took the screenshots and it's a little

412
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,540
while ago had 2000 almost 600 modules

413
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,240
that's our third-party integrations like

414
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,270
with things like new 4j or other other

415
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,810
popular systems so there's a like for

416
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,700
example Salesforce there alone for

417
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,270
Salesforce is 56 modules now some of

418
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,090
them will be better quality than other

419
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,710
others but at least some of them are

420
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,360
going to be really good so you can like

421
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,590
pull information even

422
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,250
like Salesforce and and other systems

423
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,230
said that's and that's basically the

424
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,850
idea that I wanted to share and and

425
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,850
maybe get some feedback oh yeah

426
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,730
yeah yeah yeah

427
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,680
so there's yeah that's that's a good

428
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,010
point like what do you do you see

429
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,660
something do you think that it would be

430
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,330
useful to yeah okay okay so so that's a

431
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,650
good points that you would need to do

432
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,950
some sort of sinking yeah utter sorry

433
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,040
well right now what it does like the

434
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,450
module that we've built is very very

435
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,420
basic like we spent very little time on

436
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,020
that so far

437
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,930
what it does right now is you have

438
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,030
something happening in Drupal you can

439
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,310
set it so that it will be squirreled

440
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,800
away so we like the part that we've

441
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,020
implemented was the thing before the

442
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,780
demo everything after it was like what

443
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,640
do you think should is this something

444
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,380
that you want to see built is this

445
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,850
something maybe somebody else wants to

446
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,960
build and we can collaborate on more

447
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,470
kind of like getting ideas out there and

448
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,240
then seeing how we can reach out across

449
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,150
communities to to collaborate on things

450
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,170
that was the demo simone choule that

451
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,750
time I showed so I think there's two

452
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,190
ways that you could do it one you could

453
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,770
have a JavaScript that just runs on the

454
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,680
page itself for like just visitor

455
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
statistics that might be a better thing

456
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:47,850
like just feed it directly yeah yes so

457
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,900
the way that it works yeah

458
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,760
Drupal writes so what stahma shoots the

459
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,190
module he shoots using the the rules

460
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,070
plugin the rules module rules is like

461
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,010
it's like coding without coding it's

462
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,990
it's it allows you to say like when this

463
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,650
happens do this so what he made was when

464
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,110
whatever you you set happens like

465
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,730
somebody visits a node or somebody

466
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,940
creates a node or or I don't know like

467
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,670
somebody promotes a nodes like from

468
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,670
unpublished to publish then do this

469
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,740
thing and then the thing that you do you

470
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,200
can set whatever you want using using

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,690
the tokens that he showed so what all

472
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,670
these things all this contextual

473
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,260
information that's available to Drupal

474
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
you can use to build a sapphic query to

475
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,400
save it into your database so you're

476
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
you're you're free it's a very flexible

477
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:44,550
system now we we do Drupal is Drupal

478
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,440
Drupal does its own thing we have all

479
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,540
our data there but then we also save

480
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,210
into the graph database it's not an

481
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,680
exact copy because we're not duplicating

482
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,710
we're saying it's it's a system that you

483
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,660
allow that that can be configured to

484
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,970
also store whatever else you want to

485
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:08,250
store yeah like for example events but

486
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,620
it could be even data even information

487
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,440
if you want to like somebody changes the

488
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,930
data on a certain fields and you want to

489
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,520
be you want that to be saved in your

490
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,330
graph database you can do that okay well

491
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,050
first go there

492
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,170
Drupal is our thing that's like where

493
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,410
Drupal people I know it's hard to

494
00:23:42,410 --> 00:24:03,800
understand but we can help so I think

495
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,350
that could be done so I think that like

496
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,210
you could that's a good idea yeah I

497
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,860
think that's so the question was have

498
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,800
you thought about only storing relations

499
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,890
between entities in your graph database

500
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,380
and keeping all the fields and

501
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,040
non-relational information in the in the

502
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,840
well in the Drupal database and I think

503
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,520
that that could be one way of doing it

504
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,530
probably we'd already be possible even

505
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:42,820
now just just based on the interactions

506
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,910
then you can follow the structure but

507
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,950
you have no means to kind of you know

508
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,720
figure out stuff and so on so you never

509
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,610
to have at least information that you

510
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,920
need right so long if the query system

511
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,080
doesn't isn't aware of that pointer

512
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,990
following like if the query system was

513
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,280
aware of that system then it could

514
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,060
follow those references references but

515
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,030
then they could rather be flow no no but

516
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,860
I really would have to go back to the

517
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,210
relation database tool to ask for

518
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,850
information but which would not perform

519
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,370
at all but you have to have at least as

520
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,930
much information in the graph to write

521
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,580
sets of the fairies yeah and I think

522
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,260
it's really a continuum right so I

523
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,700
actually don't agree with Christophe

524
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,159
that running and CMS on a graph to a

525
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,419
business slow because they have a lot of

526
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,820
people where should do it and it's

527
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,340
really fast and about it's a continual

528
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,230
rats and you need also other systems and

529
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,299
xst relation delayed a bit so you can do

530
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,039
everything from from the one extreme

531
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,960
that you said only ethical a shift in

532
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
the graph to the other extreme they have

533
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,250
to complete CMS running in the graph and

534
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,019
and then it depends on what you want to

535
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,809
do how far you you will go right and

536
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:07,120
then it's but all all of them are

537
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,190
possibility ahead and I really like it

538
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,799
because it makes a graph databases and

539
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,179
their content more accessible to users

540
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:14,980
and that's something that we want you

541
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,440
all want to achieve right and and no

542
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,029
matter which CMS I mean triple as an

543
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:20,769
example but I think it looks a lot of

544
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,620
other CMS systems as well but this would

545
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,899
be a really good yeah also really like a

546
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:27,850
product almost like like a graph

547
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,330
database front-end to answer a little

548
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,580
bit more like on your question so yeah

549
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,029
we are Drupal geeks and but one of my

550
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:42,039
key messages has been in the Drupal

551
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,320
community is that Drupal is a graphical

552
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,409
interface it's like it's it's incredible

553
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,029
it empowers people that are not

554
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,909
programmers I'm a by engineer like I did

555
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,340
some I'm did some programming but very

556
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,380
very little I've never really learned

557
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,960
ever to code like really code I'm a site

558
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,320
builder I click things and and even

559
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,590
though that I'm a clicker I was able to

560
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,169
build very complex products and projects

561
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,380
and and you know on a higher level I can

562
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,700
talk with people and understand what

563
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,929
they want and then build it for them

564
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,260
using graphical interfaces so I think

565
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,519
there's a whole lot of people like that

566
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,840
out there that are just nuts coders and

567
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,029
and and then expecting them to become a

568
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:26,639
coder so that they can use your product

569
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,080
yeah but I don't think that's the best

570
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,789
thing to do I think and I think that's

571
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,230
one of the key things that Drupal has

572
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,360
been very good at and like attracting

573
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,360
people that might not be coders yet and

574
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,070
like get I'm excited and hooked on this

575
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,590
whole power that it gets from this

576
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,210
graphical interface and then they all

577
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,429
start playing around with the codes in

578
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:47,409
the backgrounds if necessary and I think

579
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,120
that's one of the key things that that

580
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,350
rupal is very powerful

581
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,419
yep okay yeah we have more time one more

582
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:58,380
okay

583
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,809
yeah one other partner who built silly

584
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,299
cool stuff for four users which is not

585
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,820
like full-blown a few clones but what

586
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,139
they do they use neo4j

587
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,029
and there it's similar to what about

588
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,549
Christoph described but you get micro

589
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:13,779
app so you must imagine it's like a

590
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,580
mobile app for a business so you're

591
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,679
working on a certain part of your

592
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,240
business and actually not you're not

593
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,440
interested in all these other things

594
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,080
that other departments but usually if

595
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,129
you get the business advertised

596
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:26,200
everything right but they build like

597
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,269
micro apps where you have like one app

598
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,700
that only shows you fields your content

599
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,250
your tasks and you stir and that's

600
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,809
something I could imagine completely

601
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,039
done with football that you have like

602
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,289
per department or per use case you have

603
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,169
one micro yes I'd kind of that only

604
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,639
focuses on just one use case and it's

605
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,919
not distracting and works on mobile and

606
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,379
all the stuff and then you kind of clear

607
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:53,139
power users - together yes stuff done I

608
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:55,419
personally I was talking about last week

609
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,460
with one of our colleagues who's working

610
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,120
on marketing to use new for j4 for

611
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,519
building like personas of the people

612
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,700
that are on our mailing list and to like

613
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,679
enrich that data using like the Drupal

614
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,409
system so we could do it something like

615
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:18,690
that so yeah other questions here

616
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:39,370
yeah currently currently this is just

617
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,280
proof of concept so we've done the proof

618
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,900
of concept together and we want to see

619
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,150
we know that people are using u4j in

620
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,810
production with Drupal afford this kind

621
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,500
of applications just yeah I we already

622
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,570
know for sure that's like tracking

623
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,840
sessions like a page visits on a only

624
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,780
highly like owner highly visited website

625
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,110
with millions of hits per you know

626
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,420
you're gonna get in trouble using using

627
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,400
the PHP system just that like because

628
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
we're using caching too so that you

629
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,780
wouldn't hit PHP so there's definitely

630
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,290
issues there but there you could you

631
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,820
could do like a mix which with some

632
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,040
JavaScript in the front-end stats then

633
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,830
does the writes about visits but I think

634
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,320
it's the more the other things like the

635
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,150
when you're changing the content those

636
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,100
are things that normally you wouldn't

637
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,260
get that way and then there's a lot of a

638
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,930
lot of contextual stuff inside of the

639
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,120
CMS that you would be able to grab this

640
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,160
way customers and users that you sniff

641
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,910
or check for launch

642
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,400
so expensive Financial Times in the UK

643
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,960
uses never gave content the commutation

644
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,170
form on the website so they have like

645
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,830
millions of users yeah it's yeah yeah so

646
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,870
it's not a problem it's rather a problem

647
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,300
in kind of deciding what do I want to

648
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,850
store and how do I retrieve it and then

649
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,290
things like that but that's always

650
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,630
so dear I'm not 100 percent sure so

651
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,000
either use an ETL system or they have in

652
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,769
their editing system it sends events

653
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,390
when kind of articles are then it were

654
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,100
published and then the events are

655
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,720
translated into the graph database and

656
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,010
okay cool so you have to switch the
