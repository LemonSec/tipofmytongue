1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,019
thanks Walter can you hear me in the

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,730
back good all right

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,789
thumbs up awesome so I'm going to talk

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,750
about the config management community my

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,050
talk I think is 30 minutes so hopefully

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,100
I'm not gonna keep you here the whole

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,570
hour because I know I'm standing between

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,119
you and Belgian beer Belgian waffles

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,619
whatever is your thing

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,060
but I am at the end of the day so I'll

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,140
I'll keep it moving if I can so I spent

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,230
the past 20 years working in roles focus

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,840
mostly on open source software most

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,420
recently at puppet where I was director

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,280
of community up until the beginning of

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,890
2015 when I decided to take a little

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,440
break from working and go back to school

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,420
to get a PhD at the University of

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,270
Greenwich and these days I'm mostly

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,829
doing research focused on the Linux

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,500
kernel and looking at how Linux kernel

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,989
developers collaborate when many of them

23
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,430
actually work for competing companies

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,230
which I find pretty fascinating I'm not

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,809
sure what says about me I'm also doing a

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,729
bit of part-time community and open

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,530
source consulting with the scale factor

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,450
in London where we are hiring DevOps

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,130
engineers if anyone wants to come work

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,890
for us that's my one obligatory plug for

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,690
the work stuff I'm gonna talk about a

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,760
couple of things and and because I'm

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,500
incredibly lazy so Walter referred to

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,850
this as research which is quite a

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,650
stretch I outsource most of this talk to

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,570
people like you including some of the

37
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,299
people in this room with a highly

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,090
unscientific survey of three questions

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,369
and I ask people what's the most awesome

40
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,049
awful and apathetic

41
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,320
bits about this community so huge thank

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,970
you to everyone who did complete my

43
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,400
little survey since the survey responses

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,710
make up the vast majority of materials

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,650
for this talk again because I'm lazy the

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,680
survey had 13 responses so highly

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,920
scientific again one person sent me

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,810
feedback for Twitter DM via Twitter DM

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,149
so that's thirty fourteen responses and

50
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,540
then I of course have done this for more

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,060
years than I want to count so I've added

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,408
in a few things that I've experienced in

53
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,809
this community and because I like to

54
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,309
keep things a bit positive I'm going to

55
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:15,390
talk about the app

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,550
that I can awful things as more areas

57
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,950
for improvement and I'm gonna mix it up

58
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,090
to talk about the awesome things

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,830
alongside the areas for improvement to

60
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,959
avoid having just this gigantic section

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,370
of the talk focused about sad things

62
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,030
that suck key to having guests I'm I'm

63
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,410
an American we've had enough things that

64
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,970
really sucked over the past two weeks so

65
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,790
I'm gonna try to go with the awesome

66
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,030
examples because keeping sanity I guess

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,810
suppose so working with really really

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,910
awesome people was a common thread

69
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,370
throughout all of the replies to again

70
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,060
my highly unscientific survey and being

71
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,330
in communities where people are

72
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,230
welcoming friendly smart makes them so

73
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,709
much more enjoyable I became part of

74
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,630
this community when I started working at

75
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,570
puppet and it would have been really

76
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,180
easy for me to just sort of fade out of

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,250
this community and disappear when I left

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,550
puppet and sort of disappeared into

79
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,760
academia PhD work but I still go to some

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,040
of the conferences it's like at FOSDEM I

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,380
went to I go to a lot of the DevOps

82
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,250
conferences and I still got some of the

83
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,690
London meetup things like that I've been

84
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,940
doing a bit of blogging in the space but

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,320
the main reason I've stayed active in

86
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
this community is because I I really

87
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,750
love the people and they're fun and

88
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,880
awesome to hang out with so I keep

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,769
coming to the conferences and they're

90
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,299
generous enough to let me can continue

91
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,890
talking so I can sort of justify it it's

92
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,310
awesome but the people the people are

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,530
what make this community so amazing but

94
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,769
what really stands out to me is that

95
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,150
this is something that's true across the

96
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,920
entire configuration management

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,910
community and not just in one project so

98
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,320
you see this in the examples here on the

99
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,390
slide and you'll see it on the next one

100
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,250
as well and it comes from people

101
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,079
participating in all of the various

102
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,570
config management communities chef juju

103
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,560
ants a ball puppet

104
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,329
so in any community there are always

105
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,550
those tasks that we should all take time

106
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,399
to do but for whatever reason many of us

107
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,230
just kind of don't get around to them

108
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,990
things like documentation answering

109
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,290
questions on the mailing list and IRC

110
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,120
organizing things and it's important to

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,390
think about how many community members

112
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,280
are doing work that tends to sort of

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,320
fall between the cracks and not get

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,660
noticed much of this work just isn't

115
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,670
isn't really noticed or appreciated so

116
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,170
don't forget to thank those people who

117
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,600
are actually picking up those tasks that

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,460
everyone should be doing but not quite

119
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,070
getting around to and you can see this

120
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,020
comment from from Spencer so he says

121
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,580
that the people are what make it

122
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,860
worthwhile to participate in these

123
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,470
communities and I I wholeheartedly agree

124
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,560
with that he specifically called out

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,290
Egor so I do think so much to start an

126
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,700
Egor fan club I've said this before I

127
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,890
would totally join it anybody's work

128
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,970
with them can can attest that I've

129
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,820
always said that one of the things that

130
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,150
I love about this community is working

131
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,890
with really great people who happen to

132
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,740
work for competing companies one of the

133
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,540
best things about helping to organize

134
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,610
the first couple config management camps

135
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,320
and I used to help organize this config

136
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,900
management dev room here at FOSDEM

137
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,860
is that I get to work with some of my

138
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,430
favorite competitors once a year to to

139
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,660
do something really amazing together

140
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,820
which is secondly actually a lot of fun

141
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,280
so it it falls down this mostly meant

142
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,070
sharing bouncer responsibilities to turn

143
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,390
people away from the room which was full

144
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,810
almost all the time just not not the

145
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,430
most fun thing to do it's a bonding

146
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,830
experience I guess it's part of the

147
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,130
charm of FOSDEM

148
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,510
but this close compare this close

149
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,290
collaboration with competitors to do

150
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,750
something that helps the entire group

151
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,760
happens in other areas but I think it

152
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,890
isn't really always all that common and

153
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,900
many of us were working on these events

154
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,270
and in addition to our regular day jobs

155
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,220
because it was it was the right thing to

156
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,530
do right and it's nice to be at

157
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,690
conferences and be able to go out to

158
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,370
dinner or drinks with people who work

159
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,419
for competing companies and actually

160
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,040
have you know have a really fun time

161
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,980
also

162
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,750
I'm hanging out with them within the

163
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,310
config management community we seem to

164
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,440
have a bit of a love-hate relationship

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,860
with containers on the one hand I know

166
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,230
quite a few people in the config

167
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,760
management community who used containers

168
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,110
on a regular basis some of you use

169
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,230
containers on a regular basis how many

170
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,010
of you just don't like to raise your

171
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,050
hand during talks just as a baseline

172
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,470
okay just curious so a lot of people use

173
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,850
them in test development environments

174
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,290
but you know starting to see a few

175
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,420
people use them in more more production

176
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,160
environments and they could certainly be

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,490
handy in some situations right but there

178
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,350
is also a lot of talk from the from the

179
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,560
container side from people who think the

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,030
containers are a replacement for what

181
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,920
they often refer to as legacy approaches

182
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,800
like configuration management which

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
creates a fair bit of animosity right

184
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,210
between people in this community as you

185
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,800
can see from from the quotes on the

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,770
slide and you know that's not cool we we

187
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,640
should be able to talk about other

188
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,860
technologies while having a bit more

189
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,660
respect for some of the people using

190
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,040
those technologies and you know maybe

191
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,810
some of the issues with containers are

192
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,910
similar to the concerns about people

193
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,060
being sort of excessively aligned to a

194
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,860
particular group or a particular tribe

195
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,020
to the point where they really aren't

196
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,140
willing to consider ideas from other

197
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,460
people and can sometimes be really

198
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,290
hostile towards those new ideas or new

199
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,870
technologies I like this comment about

200
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,430
how people weren't always supportive of

201
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,770
ansible when they were sort of new on

202
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,180
the configuration management scene

203
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,790
compared to some of the other tools and

204
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,200
I think this is a bit of a double-edged

205
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,930
sword right on the one hand you have

206
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,370
some people who always want to embrace

207
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,500
or the latest and greatest technologies

208
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
the ones that are the most fashionable

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,730
this particular week and this can

210
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,050
sometimes frankly lead to a lot of

211
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,060
resume driven development which also

212
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,440
isn't necessarily what we want to be

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,660
doing you know selecting technology is

214
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,610
not based on any kind of evidence but

215
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,850
based on what's fun or cool at the time

216
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,440
on the one hand though on the other side

217
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,590
some people push back so hard on these

218
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,530
people who are just trying to you know

219
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,330
adopt something a bit more bit more

220
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,090
modern something bit more interesting

221
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,679
and just want to stick with what works

222
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,030
which

223
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,010
can lead to a bit of tribalism and

224
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,020
resistance change and the reality is we

225
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,340
need to be we need to be somewhere in

226
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,260
the middle right looking more

227
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,510
pragmatically at new technologies and

228
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,870
being willing to embrace the ones that

229
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,460
help us effectively get our jobs done

230
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,600
purely proprietary tools really haven't

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,980
really become established as leading

232
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,270
tools from the configuration management

233
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,580
space which makes us I think a bit

234
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,890
different from some other segments with

235
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,810
open source projects as the leading

236
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,170
tools we have some some pretty large

237
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,450
communities of people who are working on

238
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,460
configuration management and I think

239
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,810
this is part of what makes the

240
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,430
configuration management space so

241
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,250
collaborative and people so willing to

242
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,370
work together to share technology and

243
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,740
integrate between solutions well many of

244
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,530
these tools have competing functionality

245
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,570
the reality is that the people who use

246
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,480
them the customers of you know open

247
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,550
source projects he often use them

248
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,090
together

249
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,310
so having integrations between this

250
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,350
various tools is pretty pretty important

251
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,630
and there's also there's also a lot of

252
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,460
excitement about the technology and

253
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,230
people are willing to share ideas and

254
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,050
share code which is cool you just take a

255
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,400
look at the puppet forage or chef

256
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,830
supermarket or any of the other similar

257
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,190
products or projects and those are just

258
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,960
two examples you can see so many people

259
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,990
sharing code and working together across

260
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,250
across technologies which i think is

261
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,720
pretty cool now this problem I know I

262
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,520
don't think this is actually unique to

263
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,460
the configuration management space I

264
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,870
think there always tend to be gaps

265
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,540
between what the vendors and the

266
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,950
developers of the software I think that

267
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,990
they should do and what different groups

268
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,510
of users want to some extent this is

269
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,220
frankly this is just inevitable this is

270
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,680
the way a software development works

271
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,630
you just can't possibly please everyone

272
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,310
all the time because they have all kinds

273
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,280
of conflicting needs so different groups

274
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,860
of users will want to do slightly

275
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,050
different things and people developing

276
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,550
the software of course also have their

277
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,110
own vision for where they want to take

278
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,770
it and this is especially true of open

279
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,060
source projects I think where vendors

280
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,730
are involved right the reality is the

281
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,240
company

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,950
it's puppet for example just because I

283
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,230
worked there they they fund a lot of the

284
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,839
development of the software and they can

285
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,550
only continue to do that if they can

286
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,589
make enough money to sustain the

287
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,000
business and continue to pay those

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,240
developers pay those employees but the

289
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,550
gaps tend to get a lot smaller when the

290
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,500
vendor really spends a lot of time

291
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,839
listening to the needs of the community

292
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,630
and works hard to fund their business in

293
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,910
ways that are supportive of the

294
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,980
open-source community and I think do you

295
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,390
think that the vendors with these

296
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,190
stronger collaborative relationships

297
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,320
with their open-source communities will

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,880
be in a better position to succeed over

299
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,790
the over the longer term with all sorts

300
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,350
of people embracing DevOps and

301
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,589
automation it's become a lot more common

302
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,110
for people from ops to end up writing at

303
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,570
least some code outside of the shell

304
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,490
scripts of Perl that have been sort of

305
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,140
the mainstay of operation since even

306
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,149
before I was assistant sysadmin and that

307
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,850
was the mid-90s it's becoming more and

308
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,529
more common for people from operations

309
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,940
to write or contribute to things like

310
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,360
puppet modules chef cookbooks and with

311
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,490
these being shared and reused by a lot

312
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,920
of other people you get feedback and in

313
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
this case you often get a lot of

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,529
positive feedback which is pretty cool

315
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,270
and doesn't always happen in a lot of

316
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,149
environments and we also see some

317
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:09,850
operations people contributing back to

318
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,600
configuration management projects

319
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,180
themselves which in some cases requires

320
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,829
a bit more coding skill and maybe a

321
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,680
module or a cookbook and so I think

322
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,300
we'll continue to see these lines blur

323
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,190
between the developers and operations as

324
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,320
more and more teams embrace more of this

325
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,029
DevOps culture we've all probably

326
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,160
probably done this at some point in time

327
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,800
right made some nasty comment about the

328
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,420
technical skills of someone else

329
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,880
I know I've been guilty of this on way

330
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,250
more than one occasion not proud of it

331
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,890
but it's important to remember that you

332
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,480
you really don't always know what's

333
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,700
going on in someone else's head right or

334
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,620
why they made the technical decisions

335
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,320
that they did maybe they had a good

336
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,420
reason at the time for doing something a

337
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,270
certain way or maybe they know that they

338
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,930
took a shortcut

339
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,290
that wasn't optimal

340
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,939
and but they felt like it was the best

341
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,559
decision giving whatever constraints

342
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,759
they were working under at the time and

343
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,649
you know maybe you know maybe I generate

344
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:15,850
a little more technical debt something

345
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,799
like that but they kind of ran with it

346
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,959
and maybe they've spent maybe they spent

347
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,749
years and operations and are now just

348
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,009
starting to do a little bit of

349
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,499
development or maybe they're relatively

350
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,479
new to a particular technology language

351
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,059
or a certain way of doing things and are

352
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,470
already maybe a little insecure about

353
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,139
their abilities or maybe they were just

354
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,699
having a really really crappy day at the

355
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,639
time but the moral of this really is to

356
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,679
to give people the benefit of the doubt

357
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,949
put yourself in their position and I

358
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,019
think having a bit of empathy for other

359
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,789
people goes a long way towards

360
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:50,079
understanding what people are going

361
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,139
through well there is some occasional

362
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,850
talking crap from some people I do think

363
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,350
though that for the most part people

364
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,269
tend to be quite helpful and supportive

365
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,699
of each other I've seen a lot of

366
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,649
examples over the years of people really

367
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,660
pitching in and working together to

368
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,819
solve tough issues you know getting back

369
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,499
to my earlier comment about Ops people

370
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,019
writing code there's there's a lot of I

371
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,449
think empathy from ops people turned

372
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,480
devs when something they've written is

373
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,609
causing someone else to have an issue or

374
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,529
you know have an outage performance

375
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,449
issues something like that they they

376
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,619
actually know what it feels like right

377
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,899
to be in that position which tends to

378
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,910
make them I think sometimes even more

379
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,619
responsive when someone else is having

380
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,109
an issue because we all we all know what

381
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,759
it feels right to have things just sort

382
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,669
of on fire all around you and all you

383
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,619
want to do is to get things back in

384
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,819
working order so that people stop

385
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,309
yelling at you and I think this helps

386
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,379
make us this makes us more helpful and

387
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:48,970
collaborative even when you know it's

388
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,959
someone else it's this year that needs

389
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,498
to be solved

390
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,800
it's also really really easy to fall

391
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,860
into the trap of thinking that we know

392
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,470
the best way to solve a problem that we

393
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,700
can't learn from other people and

394
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,040
projects who came before us because

395
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,510
those projects may be different in some

396
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,850
way or maybe we think those people

397
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,940
aren't quite as clever as we are but I

398
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,650
think this is Franklin this is rarely

399
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,810
the case we can always learn something

400
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,880
from the successes and failures of those

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,510
that came before us even if you know if

402
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,280
we just take the time to do a little bit

403
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,710
of research and this is an incredibly

404
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,630
helpful community so there really is no

405
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,090
good reason for new tools and new

406
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,250
projects to be making the same mistakes

407
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,410
or running into the same issues as those

408
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,810
of those that have come before and we

409
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,760
can talk to the people who felt similar

410
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,410
tools about their challenges and

411
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,450
hopefully avoid running into some of

412
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:50,970
those same issues again now the downside

413
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,990
to more people without a coding

414
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,370
background being able to write codes

415
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,100
that you might sometimes end up with a

416
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,860
less than ideal solution but we

417
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,990
certainly can't blame this on operations

418
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,240
people writing code right I think you

419
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,130
tend to see this in most projects not

420
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,170
just configuration management we want to

421
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,640
be able to handle want to be able to

422
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,530
handle every situation every edge case

423
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,750
every possible use which then tends to

424
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,620
make things overly overly complex then

425
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,790
when someone tries to use it for a

426
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,520
relatively simple use case they need to

427
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,110
sort through a ton of options just

428
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,610
figure out how to handle their situation

429
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,920
and because we can't possibly anticipate

430
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,740
every use case some solutions won't be

431
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,450
nearly complete enough for some people

432
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,670
and people can strive for something of a

433
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,160
middle ground by building solutions

434
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,550
maybe aren't too complex but are likely

435
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,900
to meet the needs of most people while

436
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,970
being easy to extend and add additional

437
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,240
functionality however this is completely

438
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,100
a no-win situation right because it can

439
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,840
be really difficult and probably

440
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,790
impossible to strike this balance but

441
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,720
it's certainly something we can

442
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,490
certainly something we can strive for

443
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,949
part of the problem with modules

444
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,230
cookbooks that sort of thing is that the

445
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,809
quality varies tremendously from one to

446
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,240
the next some of them are amazing and

447
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,829
they used by tons and tons of really

448
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,459
really happy people and others are well

449
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,609
not so amazing right in some cases as

450
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,240
the the top quote here suggests there

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,040
isn't always great direction about best

452
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,770
practices to follow when developing them

453
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,990
so people take all kinds of different

454
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,449
approaches and some of those approaches

455
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,340
are good some not so much

456
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,520
and have but having better documentation

457
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,130
and providing better direction

458
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,720
to people about how they should be

459
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,200
developed certainly helps but you still

460
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
have the case where someone someone

461
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,049
develops something and then they they

462
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,360
just don't have time for it or they move

463
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,400
on to a new job and for whatever reason

464
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,980
it becomes abandoned and there are on

465
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,919
any of these sites big chunks of what

466
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,799
amount to module graveyards full of

467
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,770
really sad neglected unloved abandoned

468
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,669
code however there are ways that you can

469
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,530
start to solve off the sad abandoned

470
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,830
module phenomenon I personally love what

471
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,780
the Vox Populi group is doing so we have

472
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,000
at least one member of the the group

473
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,390
here in the back I love what they're

474
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,799
doing for the puppet community in some

475
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,809
cases they have adopted some of these

476
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,750
poor neglected sad modules and in other

477
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,580
cases they they work with owners to

478
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,040
proactively move their modules over to

479
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,530
this Vox Populi community and some of

480
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,850
the top modules now in the puppet

481
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,380
community are actually maintained by

482
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,960
this group they're including quite a few

483
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,059
of the puppet approved modules like the

484
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,840
archive module collecti gerra confluence

485
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,360
and few others and they've also recently

486
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,070
become a bit more organized they have a

487
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,750
governance document and an elected

488
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,140
project management committee and being

489
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,570
part of this group gives module owners a

490
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,030
bit more support from a community of

491
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,730
people who are working across a whole

492
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,409
collection of modules instead of you

493
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,090
know some lone module owner working on

494
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,760
their own

495
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,530
and everyone can work together to

496
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,780
maintain these existing modules and then

497
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,160
build some new ones as well

498
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,830
and the even accepted a poll request for

499
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,350
me when I was doing this talk I did this

500
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,500
talk before and Berlin a month or so ago

501
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,380
and uh there was a really annoying typo

502
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,450
on the website which I which I fixed

503
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,470
while I was doing research for the

504
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,010
presentation

505
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,520
I think many many projects struggle with

506
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,080
how operating system vendors include

507
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,179
their software this again is certainly

508
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,190
not a problem that is limited to

509
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,000
configuration management tools as users

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,980
it's really easy when the software we

511
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,770
want is already installed by default on

512
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,630
our you know favorite Linux distro and

513
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,909
when it's not we too often just you know

514
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:54,940
apt-get or um install and you know

515
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,750
anything that we're missing without

516
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,580
really spending enough time thinking

517
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,320
maybe about the version that we're

518
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,210
getting and and this is one of those

519
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,730
hard problems right to solve because

520
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,640
there are there are so many options if

521
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,529
I'm working on a config management tool

522
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,929
how much time do I have to collaborate

523
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,720
with all of the various different Linux

524
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,190
distros to help ensure that they're

525
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,679
actually using the most up-to-date

526
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,299
version and their package repos or

527
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,980
shipping an up-to-date version with

528
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,529
their distros and if I spend time

529
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,080
talking to them will they even have the

530
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,390
time to make the effort for my software

531
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,669
when they have thousands and thousands

532
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:36,130
of packages to think about and this is

533
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,960
again one of the scenarios that frankly

534
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,940
just doesn't have a perfect solution but

535
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,590
I do think that you know working closely

536
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,909
between the configuration management

537
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,470
tools and the operating system vendors

538
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,390
maybe we can improve it a little bit at

539
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,179
least in some situations so every

540
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,429
configuration management and DevOps oh I

541
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,169
I lied when I said that was my only plug

542
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,370
I had another one for the fact that

543
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,190
we're hiring every configuration

544
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,750
management or DevOps related conference

545
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,120
our meetup that I attend is full of

546
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,100
people who are hiring for various

547
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,240
operations roles and the the jobs for

548
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,490
these hard to fill positions of people

549
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,169
who have experience actually working

550
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,270
within dev app sin vironment s-- people

551
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,710
who are really awesome awesome at

552
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,690
operations but who also understand the

553
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,250
value of working collaboratively with

554
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,039
developers within these environments and

555
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,380
the people you know the people who can

556
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,909
automate the crap out of everything

557
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,710
right while focusing on building a

558
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,200
culture of sharing and collaboration

559
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,700
with the development teams to make sure

560
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,500
that development and operations are

561
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,210
actually working closely together as

562
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,070
opposed to throwing things over the wall

563
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,350
at each other

564
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,700
and I know a lot of people who have been

565
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,740
hired at companies based at least in

566
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,050
part and based on what they've

567
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,330
contributed to the community so most

568
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,830
companies I know hire out of the

569
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,430
community

570
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,640
puppet certainly does this sometimes

571
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
many other companies do as well and a

572
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,410
one person in the room who was hired at

573
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,430
a company because it would work he'd

574
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,240
done on a puppet module and not but not

575
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
many people have configuration

576
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,230
management expertise right now so it's a

577
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,850
kind of a great time to be looking for

578
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:20,740
that that next gig okay we all know that

579
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,990
some upgrades will be more painful than

580
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,210
others sometimes breaking changes are

581
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,830
frankly just something we need to

582
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,870
tolerate in order to make other things

583
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,620
better but we we need to make sure that

584
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,210
we're first of all correctly using

585
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,100
semantic versioning since people using

586
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,530
our software rely on those those version

587
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,180
numbers to actually decide whether it's

588
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,890
worth the risk of doing an upgrade and

589
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,930
maybe how much testing they need to do

590
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,130
to make sure that the upgrade isn't

591
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,420
going to just wreak havoc with their

592
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,060
entire environment and when we do need

593
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,590
to make those breaking changes like the

594
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,500
the puppet for example here and there

595
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,440
are many other similar examples we need

596
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,970
to think pretty carefully about how

597
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,980
those changes impact the people who are

598
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,380
actually using software and what we can

599
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,760
do to make the upgrades as easy as

600
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,150
possible

601
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,540
in the theme of things that cause pain

602
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,050
it's not uncommon for documentation to

603
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,520
be right up there near the top of the

604
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,990
list of things that are painful for

605
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,010
users how many of you prefer video going

606
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,210
back to this comment how do you mean how

607
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,620
many of you prefer video over other

608
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,950
forms of documentation no are there any

609
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,750
people in the room who work for vendors

610
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,240
who do this to poor port operations

611
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,000
people because don't documentation is is

612
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,370
one of these things that no matter how

613
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,920
much time you spend on it can almost

614
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,330
always be better and sadly sadly sadly a

615
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,460
lot of projects don't spend nearly

616
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,830
enough time focused on making sure the

617
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,200
documentation is actually correct

618
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,970
complete most importantly actually

619
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,790
up-to-date and I do think this is

620
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,080
something that they did pretty well at

621
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,250
puppet during the time that I was there

622
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,570
but I also know that there were quite a

623
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,450
few people devoted to to doing

624
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,760
documentation and the docs started

625
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,260
github repo so anyone could contribute

626
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,100
so they did make it

627
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,260
easy also to update the documentation

628
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,890
and it's it's not a small task I mean

629
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,590
looking at how many people puppet had

630
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,520
focused on it but as something that

631
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,350
projects do need to have some focus on

632
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,290
and so here's how I think about

633
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,790
documentation this is just my personal

634
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,040
philosophy on it if I could document

635
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,680
something once then when I get those

636
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,570
repeat questions on the mailing list or

637
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,150
wherever else and I can just point

638
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,550
people to the answer instead of me and

639
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,930
countless others spending hours and

640
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,460
hours and hours answering the exact same

641
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,920
questions over and over and over which

642
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,220
frankly is dull but documentation is is

643
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,900
really how you scale community and I

644
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,310
think that's important to think about I

645
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,810
did mention empathy quite a few times

646
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,820
throughout this presentation because I

647
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,710
think it's one of the keys to having an

648
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,400
amazing community full of you know

649
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,860
people who are welcoming and helpful

650
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,120
this quote was actually actually the

651
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,760
second half of a quote from a few slides

652
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,560
ago about maintain errs breaking things

653
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,420
for your users when abusing semantic

654
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,340
versioning but I wanted to spin this out

655
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,440
into a positive since I do tend to see

656
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,850
quite a bit of empathy within this

657
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,320
community

658
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,750
I see I see tweets and blog posts from

659
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,760
maintainer su are frankly just

660
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,950
heartbroken that they made some mistake

661
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,710
that caused really painful experiences

662
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,410
for their users and not all granted not

663
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,330
all maintained errs feel this way but I

664
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,350
think a lot of them are really

665
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,620
empathetic when it comes to their users

666
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,760
and you know I'm on the other hand we

667
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,830
also need to be really careful as users

668
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,050
of the software right to make sure that

669
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,180
we're we're actually showing empathy for

670
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,040
these maintained errs some of whom are

671
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,620
doing this on their free time and DevOps

672
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,590
really is sort of all about empathy I

673
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,270
think that when ops and devs can

674
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,590
actually see things from the others

675
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,110
perspective and work well together then

676
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,780
that's how we all win this this image up

677
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,390
here is a Twitter exchange between Luke

678
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,210
nice founder puppet and Mark Burgess

679
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,970
founder of cfengine

680
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,290
and this is when Luke announced that he

681
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,060
was stepping down as the CEO of puppet

682
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,940
and Mark wished him well and Luke

683
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,190
respond or yeah and Luke responded with

684
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,520
some sort of admiration for mark and I

685
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,380
wanted to actually end the presentation

686
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,560
on this note so this is this is one of

687
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,260
my favorite things about the community

688
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,580
while leaders and other communities

689
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,710
sometimes tend to focus on tearing the

690
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,260
competition down there are so many

691
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,480
examples like this one of the leaders

692
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,680
within the configuration management

693
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,810
space supporting each other and helping

694
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,110
each other which i think is pretty cool

695
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,410
because the reality is the leaders

696
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,030
really set the tone for how people

697
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,730
participate in your community when you

698
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,380
have leaders who are actually supportive

699
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,800
and gracious towards each other it

700
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,020
becomes more likely that people in your

701
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,360
community will adopt similar behaviors

702
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,570
and I've said before and and I certainly

703
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,340
mean it that the puppet community is

704
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,650
honestly really the nicest community of

705
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,450
people that I've had the pleasure of

706
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,950
being community manager for and I've

707
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,500
done this for a bunch of communities and

708
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,170
I but I think that leaders setting the

709
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,990
example for how people should behave is

710
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,520
really a big part of why the

711
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,650
configuration management community is is

712
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,989
such a great place to to participate

713
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:44,149
thank you questions so I know I'm

714
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,889
between you and beer but there's always

715
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,599
one question so I will stand here and

716
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,179
stare awkwardly into someone answers or

717
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,690
asks one
