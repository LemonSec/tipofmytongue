00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,420
 ok july on the bottom

7
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,869
 as

8
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,760
 half was

9
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:30,719
 peters options to plug in that's like mario's configuration

10
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:42,139
 because function inside brings wanted and events there

11
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,479
 either backup process the free choice

12
00:05:51,480 --> 00:06:00,540
 and masked in the component configuration blagojevich

13
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,140
 changes

14
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,128
 is it in example of what can be done with director plugin it is probably over

15
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,840
 monitoring services it works

16
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,270
 in other words, done with can use and performance data

17
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,270
 processing

18
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,919
 because this index of image composition wit the world

19
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,860
 the usa variable star will know how far is going

20

 rector

21
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,539
 the vdf plugins

22
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:56,150
 the text to be installed barrios join python plugin

23
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,060
 maybe something like enabled business lines for the deportation of the

24
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,220
 trausnitz who are coming up

25
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,720
 yes if we priests the awards

26
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,270
 we know plug in waynes with is he knows how auto or plugins maybe

27
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,849
 group introduces plugin der tross people like before

28
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,080
 vlotho

29
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,910

31
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,590
 so it might be called the last notes

32
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,890
 how

33
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,789
 in the profile delete the turn and with stone slabs companion

34
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,550
 the ent as far as the plugins want to capture

35
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,380
 until is

36
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:19,069
 the freedom in the palatinate source as here as the fine richards in the

37
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,910
 enz effient cantets box parameter sticker

38
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,330
 fits

39
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,580
 nadine thiemann plugins we come now whether to beat

40
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,060
 countries with later so that it gives you a complete example of how

41
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,209
 to internships except for python plugin

42
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,559
 This has an end now

43
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:04,150
 which new license from ampfing like the fans of the plug in mainz with

44
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,130
 because the tories with plug in will

45
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,360
 entropic samba with me see you soon

46
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,770
 however, an example of democracy

47
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,320
 richies on site at sap the log files of the process

48
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,379
 list of files and becker 6 from Dorstfeld are ultimately sampl before

49
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:40,349
 learn plugin in paris

50
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,209
 an example

51
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,519
 example of how to survive

52
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,990
 partly something myself

53
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,949
 the foreign ministers as

54
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,130
 so

55
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,249
 if you

56
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,850
 so could explain why to want to sue at home

57
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:39,029
 as he is library intensive python ftd s if how

58
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:50,299
 josef hot plugin now in stades in the python in twitter search for python

59
00:10:50,689 --> 00:11:01,409
 course modules imports with the motto get what you know that the german sweets plugin

60
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:04,879
 there were

61
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:17,949
 1 this entry point like thomas be available

62
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:35,869
 at work that calls for use was also so loud on constancy defined by use and

63
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:48,800
 ethan coen example with later the next step is free marias plugin in the

64
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:59,019
 python plugin can't dance pass plugin definition witsch because basic plugins

65
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:13,129
 drinkers in the usa box parameters yes if backup starts and the difference

66
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:21,220
 between command and option plugins is how complex the processes will be

67
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:31,129
 this is an example of the command plugin configuration of the plug in string

68
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:39,259
 defined in the inclusion and compared to get option flags

69
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:46,209
 definition plugin sting noticed the find and options section

70
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,370
 other

71
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:04,790
 spicy the difference later that if I come back here is the major difference

72
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,839
 is company command and option plugins plugin the thermal baths what is packed up x11

73
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,920
 so when thomas santl differente lenting could because an option plugin

74
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,140
 guest list files to be back up from the director and that came as defined by

75
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:31,900
 fire equal weight watchers and thanks to plug in

76
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:50,319
 then you have to wait because the callback rucksack fetches with a white cabbage if

77
00:13:50,320 --> 00:14:02,530
 the way from transform switzerland in box system backup function in python context

78
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:12,390
 parameter is everything fits end context fits like parsberg when nicole

79
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:23,230
 functions in the barrios is data structure of which we must be

80
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:34,630
 filled with a data on file backup and the most important function is a

81
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:42,730
 plugin euro function world trade today an operation is simple file backup it

82
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:54,010
 must discoverers on backup mast open file backup because plugin eurogate scholes

83
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:06,100
 rapidly and your case is packed up in indiana something monastery file backup is on

84
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:14,140
 then and back up file is called in the now also the term and if my files are

85
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:21,880
 going to be back up by the return of the end backup haggle and viscom

86
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:30,840
 plugins händel backup function is not for sony corp in the plugin option

87
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:48,800
 But I think there are so far the sessions that you think should be

88
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,589
 code in the maria score coaches when she should be most important monza the job fair

89
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:09,330
 junction which can generate information reporting messages aspects directors of the

90
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:20,880
 outer in the job blog and rent back messages which are important when the

91
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:32,310
 wave riding plugin the cost of the live show debug messages because you have you

92
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:41,540
 north from here in the dropbox app sometime in the back in the forward

93
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,680
 and we have that they used to get me you said

94
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:02,500
 because hot confesses like monolith exchange sense to use in herrieden

95
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:11,199
 streams existent barrios he thinks of a python plugin package already race class

96
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:22,429
 the celebration should functions the possible and logistics culture in harriet's wife we

97
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:29,540
 have the pipe which is wrapped the girlfriend olga functions thetakom

98
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,830
 in wild plugin

99
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,710
 example of how to run barrios fdp before ground combat like you

100
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,220
 the messages at level one hundred except

101
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,100
 then stood

102
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:14,480
 okay, that's dan coats from constancy

103
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:26,699
 Now that the batteries to do locally on the ex is in plug-ins and review too

104
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,930
 understand how it works

105
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,570
 the construction out of glass the fans the most important step

106
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:03,658
 he is ok for example if you want your files how to do it so he got to inter

107
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:09,230
 milito rektors example shot

108
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,419
 and yes of the most important functions is the plug in euro functions

109
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:27,960
 which is called the different operations

110
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:42,789
 at the beginning, scholes is us open and us open is also so flexible

111
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:57,850
 opens backup restore like in the place the costs like nord only knows

112
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:09,250
 backup files with plug in is like can call also functions tools you obediently

113
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:20,710
 tampe database and g data stream beckett must still exist libya file over the

114
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,830
 back up case work in the restore case

115
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:44,549
 of the call plugin codemasters variable until the end of data suite in f

116
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:54,129
 people samples point to study of you want to sing

117
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:03,870
 however there exist plugin is what is written in python is mysql plug in

118
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:12,510
 which the works like the way back in updater is best

119
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:19,080
 he praised kripo it was mostly at the post office damn log file system and

120
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,240
 the users online backup to back evaporate database the provision ventoux

121
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,540
 first steam locomotive file system water cent data stream directly to the backup

122
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:43,610
 server and plug in it is something nice automatically

123
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:51,000
 the germans of the list of data base in the data better was an exact basecap

124
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,360
 bradley

125
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:06,899
 the options and explain in detail here is so extremely, very interesting plug-in

126
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:15,360
 model of the back macnews on balconies extra backup ripples incremental

127
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:26,789
 backups on mysql data base in europe and recovery of you want to get started

128
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:35,789
 watch out with development plugins it's good to set up for development and i

129
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:45,840
 have instructions of how to set up barrios in the documentation of the place in

130
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:55,649
 suse studio like created price conficker plans michael brand and katy m saves

131
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:03,500
 is gone volunteer camp found huge installation up and running and here

132
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,080
 here is hollywood dedicate to july

133
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:23,549
 so he is a whole of how to back up in the development like euro die

134
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:33,720
 the mba plugin witches would be webos mansion in which la torre di wants to do so

135
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,909
 working on plug in which makes you on the backup restore pi know that we have

136
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:50,330
 had a very excellent talk about instrument backups in juno so ist so

137
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,620
 something that's where i would be interesting to sing with her in front of elements

138
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:05,120
 python plugin kazamias on humans like here

139
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:17,379
 success be sql database sql database like more goalie pianist der

140
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,950
 very large or is one where the baby you tube for smaller [ __ ] die bi

141
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:32,140
 databases with requests in black and white yes what did he want in docker do the

142
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:46,000
 company have nothing is yes we are against the long time gw emst after

143
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,680
 testing the most promising of how precious the monsters' incremental backups is

144
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:10,690
 bring you think you are so many questions ideas per server that's only

145
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:23,320
 plugin solutions server and think it's possible to lend lease full backups

146
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:31,990
 xen server was fdp as you know that with plugin the latter posse

147
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,740
 plugin what is so well endowed implemented in times like cord use

148
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:53,490
 them to get a list of the virtual machine backup and they also everything ok

149
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,790
 around here so

150
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:06,469
