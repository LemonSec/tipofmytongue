1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,899
hello everyone welcome to the security

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,320
to their room we are now going to have a

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,799
talk by Andre who's going to talk about

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,119
systems configuration management system

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,310
foremen and with open Skype please

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,410
welcome Andre hi I hope the sound is

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,900
okay so today I'll be talking about

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,449
foreman auditing and how you can do that

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,180
with foreman at all and open ask up so

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,040
in the beginning I'd like to talk a

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,620
little bit about our motivation why we

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,840
would want to do any of this then I'll

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,940
talk about openness cap and format

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,830
because I don't know if you know these

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,290
projects maybe you do and maybe you use

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,600
them if that's the case then feel free

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,330
to sleep and in the end I'll show you

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,280
how these two sort of come together and

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,690
what you can do with it okay so a brief

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,570
info about me I work at Red Hat I'm one

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,310
of the forum and openness containers

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,360
that's about it really

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,630
so why compliance well if you have been

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,490
without any kind of a security incident

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,399
in the past then that's great and I hope

26
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:17,249
it will last in the future but the

27
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,009
future is always uncertain and there's

28
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,109
always a chance that there is something

29
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,689
bad lurking just behind the corner and

30
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,659
for me personally I don't think I will

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,999
be targeted because I'm not really a

32
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,100
person of interest to anyone I don't

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,619
have any business critical information I

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,200
don't have anything related to national

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,569
security and I definitely don't have it

36
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,060
in my private email account but if you

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,249
are a company or a government then you

38
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,319
are much more visible and you are much

39
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,939
more likely to be a target and maybe

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,649
people will try to take over your

41
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,780
service and get to your data and maybe

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,850
they won't but that's not something you

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,289
really want to leave to a chance

44
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,590
entirely so one of the things that you

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,709
can actually do is to set up policy a

46
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,409
compliance policy and then try to force

47
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,959
yourselves and your users to comply with

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,860
it and the policy tries to mitigate the

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,970
risks that things go really bad and if

50
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,540
you decide to go this way then ASCAP is

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,670
actually something that can help you

52
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,360
with it it's security content automation

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,110
protocol it was designed for

54
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,790
vulnerability management and automate

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,020
the whole process and opens cap is open

56
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,330
source implementation of that it's

57
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,460
certified this is a National Institutes

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,130
Institute of Standards and Technology

59
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,500
it's part of US Department of Commerce

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,200
so if you tell your auditors that you

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
use a tool that has a government stamp

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,110
on it I'm sure they'll be quite happy

63
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,010
and opens cap provides you with a bunch

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,880
of tools basically the first one here is

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,130
command-line scanner then you have open

66
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,860
Eska daemon that surprisingly runs as a

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,050
daemon down here is anaconda plugin that

68
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,330
you can use with anaconda installer and

69
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,000
open escape workbench that provides you

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
with graphical interface you can run

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,940
scans locally and many more things

72
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,170
okay moving on to for men basically for

73
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,989
men in a nutshell does three things

74
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,160
provisioning configuration and

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,590
monitoring and I'll stop to talk a

76
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,090
little bit about each of these

77
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,600
provisioning so for men provisions

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,090
couldn't contain us VMs or bare metal

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,000
I've heard this one story that someone

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,160
was actually doing experiments and

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,620
trying to provision cash registers in a

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,810
supermarket but for some reason it

83
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,760
didn't work the hardware just couldn't

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,730
handle it somehow but so it got my

85
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,239
attention basically Foreman works with

86
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,200
most of the well-known computer resource

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,680
providers like we own are easy to Amazon

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,649
you name it if you think we're missing

89
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,279
something

90
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,709
then let us know and maybe we'll do

91
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,800
something about it and if not you can

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,870
always write your own plugin and support

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,240
it yourselves some of these are already

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,729
supported through plugins so you can use

95
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,120
that as an in spear

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,419
and Foreman does both network and image

97
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,419
based provisioning okay configuration

98
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,280
puppet is kind of a first-class citizen

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,099
for Foreman because I've heard this

100
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,830
rumor that Foreman started as a UI for

101
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,530
puppet but that was a long time ago and

102
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,550
for man evolved a lot since then you can

103
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,650
if you don't like puppet for some reason

104
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,349
you can use also unstable or chef or

105
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:07,909
salt it's entirely up to you okay

106
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:13,060
monitoring basically for man receives

107
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,120
data from host and tries to display it

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,229
to users in a meaningful way

109
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,139
that's your graphs your report your

110
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,009
trends and so on basically in this area

111
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,860
also for the openness cup reports that

112
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,409
we'll see in just a minute and right now

113
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,539
I think it's kind of obvious where we're

114
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,550
headed we have four men that can set up

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,650
their machines and we have open s cup

116
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,370
that can monitor them for compliance

117
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,620
policy violations so people said hey

118
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,969
let's get these two together

119
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,360
and they did create it form an openness

120
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,900
cap which is a foreman plugin and now

121
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,389
I'll try to show you what what you can

122
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,779
do with it

123
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,110
basically yeah you could see my you

124
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,900
could see my Foreman now maybe I'll try

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:17,409
to a little bit zoom out maybe not okay

126
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,629
basically I have two holes here the

127
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,090
third one is actually my Foreman server

128
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,550
and if you if you're looking for the

129
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,979
opener scope related stuff okay it's

130
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,250
down here

131
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,950
okay this is not good Arthur I'll try to

132
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,680
zoom out yeah that's my mother okay down

133
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,010
here on the host and first thing we'll

134
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,080
take a look at look at our scope

135
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,010
contents basically Skype content is an

136
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,610
XML file that has a specific format and

137
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,590
you can see I have already a couple of

138
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,400
these here these come from

139
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,830
one of the open SK packages and they get

140
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,290
uploaded once you install the plugins so

141
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,590
you get them right out of the box so we

142
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,310
can always but you can always upload new

143
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,500
one if you have one so let's do them do

144
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,380
that right now actually choose the file

145
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:44,160
write and submit maybe let's do this

146
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,620
yeah right

147
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,070
so I uploaded my Skype content and move

148
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,010
on to the policies and policy is

149
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,290
actually something that gets applied

150
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,500
directly to our host so let's create a

151
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
new policy

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,910
okay let's name it again description is

153
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,050
optional so let's skip it and here we

154
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,120
can choose scrap contents so I'll choose

155
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,360
the one that I've just uploaded and I

156
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,880
have to choose a profile and the profile

157
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,240
is within the actual file that I have

158
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,600
uploaded and it's basically says what

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,540
gets checked during the scan so there's

160
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,910
only this one in the file so I also like

161
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,059
that and move on and now I will choose

162
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,169
my schedule how often my policy runs you

163
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,169
can choose from weekly monthly custom so

164
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,620
let's say I want monthly and I want

165
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,920
every fourth day in the month and I'll

166
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,150
move on

167
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,540
and the last thing I'll do is to choose

168
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,350
my host group and basically I'm done so

169
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,410
what exactly is a house group well

170
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,810
basically if you are creating a lots of

171
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,670
hosts these holes

172
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,210
usually have something in common and you

173
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,300
don't want to do it each time from

174
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,839
scratch

175
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,120
so as you can see this is the place

176
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,930
where I can create a new new host and

177
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,570
basically it has a lots of tabs and lots

178
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,360
of fields to be filled in and I don't

179
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,250
really want to do that each time so I

180
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,500
have my host group and I choose my host

181
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,160
group and now I choose my choose where

182
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,170
to deploy I want to deploy on the berth

183
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,900
and basically I'm done because all this

184
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,010
gets populated from the information but

185
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,200
this gets populated from the host group

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,339
so if if I now click Submit I can create

187
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,500
a new host and it would start to

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
provision assuming that I have

189
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,990
configured everything correctly but I

190
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,400
don't really want to create a new host

191
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,520
now so let's go back and that's why you

192
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,930
have the host group selector in your

193
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,290
policy in the policies art because that

194
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,200
policy gets applied to or all hosts that

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,990
have that host group okay so now you

196
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,810
have set up your policy and I will have

197
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,610
your host and you have applied the

198
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,650
policy to your host and so what next

199
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,690
well next thing you can do is to sit

200
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,520
back and wait for your report to come in

201
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,620
based on the schedule that you have

202
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,110
selected in your policy but you can

203
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,779
always do that you can always run scan

204
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,240
manually and you would do that by using

205
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,140
SSH and to SSH into your host and then

206
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,360
you would type in command to run a scan

207
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,700
and it would run a scan and it would

208
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,339
send it to Foreman but if you have a

209
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,770
remote execution plug-in for Foreman you

210
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,740
can do this do it from UI so I have that

211
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,839
already set up I have a host with my

212
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,290
policy and now I have a prepared job

213
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,070
that can basically run a scan so I'll do

214
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,290
that now I'll select my host the one

215
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,649
that is

216
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,689
online and our solectron job basically

217
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:14,079
job category OpenScape I won't start

218
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,350
OpenScape scan I want to apply it to my

219
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,279
Danish Queen host and execute now so

220
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,119
this should take only a few seconds it

221
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,879
seems it seems like it started and this

222
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,980
is the command that gets executed and

223
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,670
it's it's done and it's a success so

224
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,459
let's check out our report so I go to

225
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,300
report and I see I have a new report

226
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,869
here that landed just a minute ago from

227
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,819
the overview I can see that it's failing

228
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,899
so let's take a look at the details so

229
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,600
here you can actually see all the rules

230
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,910
that are checked and what the result of

231
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,249
the actual check walls and you have the

232
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,350
metrics and so this sort of breakdown

233
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,050
how many rows failed and how many passed

234
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,230
and if you I go to view full report then

235
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,389
this is actually what open escapes ends

236
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,670
with some styling and you have again

237
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,420
lots of info here what will failed how

238
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,850
how many of them passed and so on and so

239
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,959
on and one interesting thing is down

240
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,149
here if I go to the details of the

241
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,059
actual rule and scroll down I have a

242
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,999
remediation script and if you run this

243
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,179
on your host you should get the this

244
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,360
rule fixed so let's let's do that now

245
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,370
and let's try to fix one of these rules

246
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,639
so again I have prepared a job with this

247
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,329
script so I will run it to using remote

248
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:49,329
execution and try to get it fixed so

249
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,499
again I go to all my hosts I have host

250
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:57,809
selected so select action ran job again

251
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,759
category open ask up and this time I

252
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,660
want fixed Java config there so let's

253
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,759
execute seems like a success

254
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,810
yeah all I have to do is actually early

255
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,010
around the scan so I will run the scan

256
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,660
once I find the correct page

257
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:31,560
so again run a job and open ask up start

258
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:40,470
open escapes can submit success ok again

259
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,990
let's take a look at the report and as

260
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,360
you can see I have a new report and it

261
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,090
has one on the rule that has PAS this

262
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,110
that is ok and the remaining needs to be

263
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,030
fixed so basically this is how you can

264
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,350
check the compliance with openness crap

265
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,070
and I'll just get get back to my slides

266
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,980
future features basically one of the

267
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,470
features that was done recently is

268
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,110
tailoring files this allows you to

269
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,210
allows you to modify your profiles and

270
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,700
modify or policies it's done it will be

271
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,520
in the next release of form an openness

272
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,670
cap then we have plant running the

273
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,620
aramid a mediation using and using

274
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,500
remote execution like we would will

275
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,230
parse the remediation step a mediation

276
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,280
scripts from from the report that came

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,320
in and was failing and you would have

278
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
this one sort of button that you would

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,620
just push and poof

280
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,930
everything would be fixed and we are

281
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,230
always happy to hear your suggestions so

282
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,380
basically that's all I have if you have

283
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:02,240
any questions please don't hesitate okay

284
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,850
so questions first thing my boss will

285
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,480
ask does it apply to Windows as well

286
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,750
well basically we are limited by by open

287
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,240
Skype what open Skype support and what

288
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,710
open scrap scans we can we can we can

289
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,410
basically use it

290
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,230
I don't think opens cap supports Windows

291
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,070
so raise your hand if you want to ask a

292
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,870
question there is one over here and one

293
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,160
order I how do you extend the escape

294
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,450
roof rows it to include your own chicks

295
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,000
basically you can use open s-capepod

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,090
bench to modify to create the tailoring

297
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,460
files that's the new feature that will

298
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,800
be introduced and basically people

299
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,200
people write their own Skype contents

300
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,310
themselves if you it has specific

301
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,190
formats that you have to stick to and

302
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,130
that's that's how you basically create

303
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,580
your own checks and decide what gets

304
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:28,490
checked during this scan hi yeah

305
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,780
given that you said that puppet is a

306
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,390
first-class citizen with Foreman is this

307
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,320
how open Skype runs on the house and if

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,050
yes can it run with anything other than

309
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,810
puppet puppet and if no can it run with

310
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,040
puppet yeah basically we use puppets to

311
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,950
deliver the client that runs the scan to

312
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,860
the host right now it it it can right

313
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,220
now it can't really run without puppet

314
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,130
at least we haven't tried to because

315
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,770
it's kind of tight tied together and

316
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,829
there are few there are future plans as

317
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,980
we progress with ansible and other

318
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,949
configuration tools also to make it more

319
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,400
available to other config tools to work

320
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,430
with

321
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,349
follow up on the first question you

322
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,240
mentioned something about opens cap not

323
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,930
supporting windows there are SCAP

324
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,240
templates supporting windows oh and you

325
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,020
can also for example use perpetuate or -

326
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,820
machine so why would there be any

327
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,150
limitations in opus cap ok so I I didn't

328
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,580
know there were there are really

329
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,130
policies for Windows so my bad so and

330
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,140
for cisco devices and falklands Oh

331
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,200
forgive if there are voices and if open

332
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,240
cap can actually scan a Windows machine

333
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,290
then we can support just questioning the

334
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,030
open Skype versus cap format so first

335
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,720
cap it's possible apparently yeah as

336
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,760
I've said we are we are using opens cap

337
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,500
and opens cap is able to to do we can

338
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,120
support ok so but thanks for more

339
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:30,270
questions hello I have a question about

340
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,840
the output so if we have some findings

341
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,140
say 10 findings for a server some might

342
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,360
be false positive but that scan might

343
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,570
still apply to my other servers say if I

344
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,610
have this false positive or this thing I

345
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,920
accept at one server for example IP

346
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,980
forwarding on my VPN server can I

347
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,930
whitelist that or acknowledge that as a

348
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,130
false positive for that specific server

349
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,940
well I would I would recommend to

350
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,000
basically tailor that policy and answer

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,780
uncheck do rule basically remove the

352
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,270
rule from scan so you wouldn't have to

353
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,640
deal deal with it if you if you if you

354
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,310
think it's a false positive you can just

355
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,270
make a separate policy for one yes you

356
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,120
can basically make like do you mean you

357
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,820
have your example of a VPN server which

358
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,000
allows IP forwarding and on all my other

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,620
servers I don't want that

360
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,790
yeah yeah okay I get it for you the new

361
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,370
tailoring file feature will be very

362
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,190
useful because you can assign assign a

363
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,060
tailoring file to that policy and that

364
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,850
that host basically okay there's one

365
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:55,880
more quick question actually Foreman is

366
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,030
the only tool to allow the orchestration

367
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,100
of opens gap or is there is any other

368
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,610
tool that you you may use to to

369
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,950
orchestrate or deliver all your agent of

370
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:17,780
opens gap it's not clear basically you

371
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,930
can use you can use open scrap on its

372
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:29,090
own without Foreman you have some kind

373
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,570
of user interface so now well the tools

374
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,290
that I've shown here basically these you

375
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,340
can use these on your own and the open

376
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,770
escape workbench has graphical interface

377
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,800
and this is basically only a command

378
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,680
line scanner okay that you can use on

379
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,800
your own we have plenty of time for

380
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,020
questions so who raise your hand if you

381
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,030
have any we have one over here you

382
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,500
mentioned that there's a plugin for

383
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,030
anaconda for the Installer

384
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,060
yeah does is there any plans to Beck I

385
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,830
know it's in seven is there any plans to

386
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,640
back port there to six I don't really

387
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,100
know what opens cup guys have planned oh

388
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,170
this is the redhead team that's

389
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,020
developing the anaconda installation

390
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,310
component yeah but I don't have what

391
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,460
they have what they have in mind for the

392
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,710
future well it's not really on my radar

393
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,460
so I can't really tell it's it's the

394
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,050
best thing for you would be to contact

395
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,020
the open skype guys and ask them their

396
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,710
directly no it's actually the redhead

397
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,390
guys that are developing the Anaconda

398
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,440
installation rapper to support the

399
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:05,000
escape policies at install time again

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,740
raise your hand if you want to ask a

401
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,529
question hi another question so this is

402
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:16,100
about the execution bit M is there a

403
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,529
possibility in extending Foreman in such

404
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,510
a way that when you have the remediation

405
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,039
step you can directly run it from the

406
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,399
you know the bit that that suggests it

407
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,250
directly how do you mean

408
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,960
so you know you have the remote

409
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,850
execution engine with Foreman yeah and

410
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,890
the open Skype gives you a remediation

411
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,919
step that says run this for your hosts

412
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,669
okay can you is there a way of running

413
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:51,100
it directly from that from that

414
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,289
input-output no not yet

415
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,809
not yet but there are points for that in

416
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:01,580
the future excellent raise your hand if

417
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,720
you have another question

418
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:12,090
yes over dinner two more minutes for

419
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,259
questions is there a way in that UI

420
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,379
except for perhaps using using cron to

421
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,870
run these jobs to do these checks

422
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,289
periodically to maybe detect that there

423
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,789
was an attack and something was changed

424
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,980
in the meantime and get alerted about it

425
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,279
well automatically we use cron in the

426
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,799
background and so I can say run this

427
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,870
every day or something yeah you can run

428
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,700
this every day

429
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,360
you can basically if I go to the policy

430
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:56,700
resort you can you you can choose a

431
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,460
crowd you can choose how often you want

432
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,980
your policy to run based on the cron

433
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,269
line whose custom you just specify or

434
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:10,830
online and that thank you very much we

435
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,769
have a final question here is it

436
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:18,659
possible to trigger from an outside

437
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,139
application via API call instead of

438
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,090
scheduling the scan and the second

439
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,659
question can you can we hook up like for

440
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,389
an event in an external system after

441
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:36,240
that now right now

442
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,419
it's meant to run periodically and to

443
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:43,230
check it in at certain times but maybe

444
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,299
that that could be a request for feature

445
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:58,059
okay let's thank Andre once again and

446
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,269
there will
