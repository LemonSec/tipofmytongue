1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,369

3
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:16,880
mottled it on Michael wait see well okay

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,200
hi everybody

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,420
hello so it's a pleasure for me to be

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,050
there today and I'm going to talk about

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,140
jaspera which is a an offensive social

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,150
network I think you know about it and I

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,780
I feel really happy to be in the

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,170
decentralized room to see that the the

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,299
mine of people is changing and that we

12
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,890
know how this room at the first time and

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,650
I hope like Tristan said that it will be

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:57,379
bigger next year so shortly I'm flat so

15
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,960
that's how everybody called me

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,110
I work in Grenoble in a small company we

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,509
do we which does carefully and mostly

18
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,950
Mozilla from a soft and diaspora

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,539
contributor so I care about how unlike

20
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,630
privacy I feel like we need to do some

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,219
to ride the Internet so that's why I

22
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,560
joined from a soft and I'm running the

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,399
Framus Fair which is one of the biggest

24
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,570
jaspera server in France and hosted by

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,890
from I surfed so maybe some of them some

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,039
of you are users so why did why does the

27
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,659
desperate project exists the first thing

28
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,899
is I feel like and I hope you feeling

29
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,829
like that too that sharing is awesome I

30
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,929
know a lot of people who are afraid of

31
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:57,289
Facebook and they are just like you know

32
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,630
the memory of the good old times when

33
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,170
you were talking to your friend in real

34
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,229
life and I feel like the social network

35
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,610
can be way better than it is right now

36
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,600
and maybe something which is good and

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,650
that's actually you have kind of

38
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,530
like to kind of people the the one who

39
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,659
just doesn't care and use Facebook and

40
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,090
don't care about their data and the one

41
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,849
who are afraid and just use nothing and

42
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,790
there is room between them to breathe

43
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,909
something great to use which will hello

44
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:37,250
you to share with your friends your

45
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,159
contact everyone in the world but

46
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,859
without being spied be the without being

47
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:46,760
used to make money by corporation so

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,799
that's that's the the first things there

49
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,950
is also things about the rules if you're

50
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,900
a Facebook or Twitter user you may

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,269
notice that you're not always welcome on

52
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,430
those Network depending on what you

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,980
share what you think which country you

54
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,170
are using which from country you're

55
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,650
using the network so for example we so

56
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,220
during the the hot spring Facebook being

57
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,760
cut in Tunisia it's really easy to catch

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,799
you you just have to switch off the DNS

59
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,019
and that's it no more Facebook for

60
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,790
thousands of person and so the the last

61
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,470
thing is yeah we want to be able to

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,000
control the service we want to be able

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,769
to control the data so we need to split

64
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,299
it to decentralize so the first thing

65
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,699
you can say about just rise

66
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,699
decentralized technically it's really

67
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,519
really close to email everybody can set

68
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,280
up an email server and everybody can set

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,750
up at just for a server and you will be

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,379
able to talk to everyone else sitting

71
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,400
another email so if you if you feel like

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,519
you you can house to just brandade I

73
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,379
really encourage you to do so it it will

74
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,359
help you to talk with everyone it's not

75
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,599
only what's going on on your server it's

76
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,250
not for you and your friends only you

77
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,989
can set up a server for you and your

78
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,000
friends but you will be able to reach

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,310
everyone from the Jasper Network from

80
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:26,150
from this place so yeah and the the data

81
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,909
are are controlled only by the server

82
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,020
administrator so if you feel like

83
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,599
example you trust from a soft you can

84
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,490
join us and from as fans will be as easy

85
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,949
as register with one click like Facebook

86
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,470
if you feel like you want to control

87
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,449
completely all the data you want the

88
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,590
images on your house you want to be the

89
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,180
only one to be able to remove your

90
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,310
messages then you will have to host

91
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,500
yourself and you will be the master of

92
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:01,900
everything so this not this this is

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,940
pretty funny because well we are talking

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,729
about social networking and you you will

95
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,740
recognize Facebook there but you can

96
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,620
replace Facebook by almost any other

97
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,050
American corporation and will we you

98
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,990
will have the exact same shot so so I

99
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,550
said the other point is social I

100
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,819
strongly feel that we can do way more

101
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,060
than we hug actually doing for a lot of

102
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,580
interesting topic of course for free

103
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,729
software's but also for ecology politics

104
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,199
almost everything you want and the the

105
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,740
Internet is the it's something as

106
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,639
important as the the printing was by

107
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
Guttenberg hundreds of years ago like

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,750
everybody now can send stand up and talk

109
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,900
and you will be able to reach thousands

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,430
millions of people within minutes we

111
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,139
need to be able to do that to build a

112
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,529
better world so I feel like sharing is

113
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:13,000
really important and about the jaspera

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,300
features you will be able to do mostly

115
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,819
what you can do with a traditional

116
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,580
social network so sharing images and

117
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,270
polls and with all the classic features

118
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,789
like mentions and hashtags and to be

119
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,710
able to react by liking commenting or

120
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,810
sharing that's that's the curse of the

121
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,590
social network but just rise more than

122
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,710
that we also give more power to the user

123
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,719
to be able to transform the the message

124
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,550
so to be able to write

125
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,280
and to insert images where he wants to

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,190
inside the the textile to say this

127
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,830
should be in bold or italic or this is a

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,330
title least table inside videos and many

129
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,330
things you can move in a range inside

130
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,830
the network and finally jazz pride is

131
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,770
about privacy so this centralization is

132
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,050
already something really really good in

133
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,000
terms of privacy that you control the

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,840
data but still the software itself is

135
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,560
really privacy oriented so that means by

136
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,800
default the user will be in a secure

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
world like when your register on

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Facebook you you first register and then

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,990
you have to go to the settings deeply

140
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,210
inside the sittings to find everything

141
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,860
you can hide so no I don't want my

142
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,810
birthday to be public no I don't want my

143
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,640
friends to be public no I don't want my

144
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,500
pictures to be public each sitting is

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,140
deeply hidden inside the Facebook

146
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,570
configuration by default if you do not

147
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,640
touch anything on just by just after you

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,700
you register you will be safe this is

149
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,670
really important the the hub team versus

150
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,470
opt-out mine when you build a software

151
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,540
especially we do not require real name

152
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,300
no even a valid email address if you

153
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,520
don't put valid email address by which

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,740
when you register inside just probably

155
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,690
you just will not be able to recover

156
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,260
your password and you will not reserve

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,080
any email notification but that's it the

158
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,630
software itself works without email so

159
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,980
if you want to be completely anonymous

160
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,890
and I know a few nerds which can be

161
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,440
reached using at all so directly with an

162
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,960
onion address so if you want to be

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,720
completely anonymous you can do you can

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,809
do that we are using a system called

165
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,720
aspects which is which has been cooked

166
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,210
ID by Google with a circle inside

167
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,780
Google+ to define the different aspect

168
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,910
of your life so your co-workers or your

169
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,820
family your friends and deeply control

170
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,280
the who is accessing the data you're

171
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,420
publishing right now that that's pretty

172
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,999
efficient

173
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,709
other example of privacy feature right

174
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,869
here for example I don't know if you

175
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:06,129
know the the small demonstration project

176
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,769
which was maybe something called shat on

177
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,579
to someone one day just feel like oh my

178
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,499
god I want to know whether the kitten

179
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:17,980
are on the internet so it go on Flickr

180
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,029
Iggy

181
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,839
it goes on Google Image it bring

182
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,579
something like 1 million pictures of of

183
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,419
cats and it just had a look at the eggs

184
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,059
if so the GPS location of its each

185
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,269
picture and put that on a map and it was

186
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,540
really scary yo you you display the map

187
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,209
and you see like oh this is the cat of

188
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,399
my friend right here and you will be

189
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,739
able to see the picture of the cats all

190
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,859
around you and you say you you're like

191
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,439
ok when I take a picture I don't think

192
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,259
about all the Queen sequences but most

193
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,499
of the time from a smartphone the

194
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:58,569
location of the picture is is recorded

195
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:01,689
and you will to say at which time and at

196
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,480
which place it has been taken so this

197
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,899
give a lot of information about the user

198
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,480
in jaspera by default they exist that so

199
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,249
the metadata of the picture are stripped

200
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,410
when you upload it so you upload the

201
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,449
picture and everything behind it is

202
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,429
removed you we only keep the picture and

203
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,489
so another one is the the proxifier

204
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:28,509
content so a lot of pictures are linked

205
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,579
inside social network from other website

206
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:36,459
you have also the Open Graph short text

207
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,869
presentation when someone passed the

208
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,749
league on Facebook on just raw so if I

209
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:45,129
post a link to a website a request will

210
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,439
be made to this website to display a

211
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,970
short summary of it just under the past

212
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,389
so if you load the images for example at

213
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,629
the website did this means that each

214
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,759
user which will display who will deal

215
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,860
play it will will do a request to this

216
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,709
server so will be able to be tracked by

217
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,870
it

218
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,180
so we set up a proxy so all the images

219
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,120
can go by the note itself and the user

220
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,490
is not doing any queries from the

221
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,890
external to the external world only to

222
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,050
the just for our server so it's not

223
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:31,080
tracked this is the Jasper a publisher

224
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,400
so I just wanted to show you how easy it

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,670
could be to format your text and choose

226
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,200
what you want to do so we support Mac

227
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,350
down there is some shortcut on the top

228
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,580
the pole picture on geolocation if you

229
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,100
want to hide it

230
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,589
they're sitting there is to hover you to

231
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,240
post directly from just right to

232
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,420
Facebook Twitter or tumblr because the

233
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,370
transition is pretty hard for most of

234
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,980
people so we want to be able to connect

235
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,190
with with the outside world and the

236
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,640
aspect is are you select who is able to

237
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,940
see the person jasper eyes no community

238
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,370
run project but it says it has phoned by

239
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,490
for Chanukah students after a talk by

240
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,589
him eben Moglen i don't know if you know

241
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:26,040
him

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,330
a he wrote the GPL license with stalin

243
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,360
is an advocate and is really interesting

244
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,730
i really encourage you to listen to to

245
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,850
Moglen talks so they they started a

246
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,240
Kickstarter campaign unfortunately they

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,690
were pretty in experimented and this

248
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,530
thing didn't go wells and the this is

249
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,530
the site part of the talk one of them

250
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,990
even committed suicide because of the

251
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,110
pressure coming from everywhere and so

252
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,770
at this time the desperate project was

253
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,060
almost something dead like they didn't

254
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,220
want to work on it anymore so they

255
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,250
decide to release it to the community

256
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,330
and for more than four years no the the

257
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,970
community bring the project so the FSN

258
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,040
is an organization

259
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,420
managed by heben morgan this is the who

260
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,639
they are urging their assets for so all

261
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,490
the trademark and copyright for just run

262
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,000
some money too but most of the time we

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
are just managing the project yourself

264
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,970
without any problem we were using the

265
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,100
the loomio tool to make to take decision

266
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,440
as there is and rights of person on it

267
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,269
who can vote and you're welcome to join

268
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,759
everybody can vote and take decision

269
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,389
about just rob and we moved on a new

270
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,560
release system so we know release in

271
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,769
minor fashion every six weeks and we

272
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:10,009
release a first measure of ation in May

273
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,540
2013 and we all know what the sixth

274
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,009
measure of version which was released

275
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:22,500
September with a deeply improved

276
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,449
Federation so the protocol between the

277
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,170
nodes and a new redesign I cannot I

278
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,930
cannot not talk about the fact that we

279
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,579
saw his is coming on Jastrow on August

280
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,089
2014 so we need to be decentralized we

281
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,389
need to be to protect ourselves from

282
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:49,589
cooperation but the espera was not built

283
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,569
to be no Lowe's land it's something I

284
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,199
want precise because we are not so we

285
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,290
are not fighting the government here the

286
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,740
decentralisation alo has to be resilient

287
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,519
to censorship but this is not the first

288
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,100
goal of J's bra the first goal of Jasper

289
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,250
ice to avoid Facebook and and Google and

290
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,829
hold a data mining and ads targeting

291
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,939
done by American corporation but we do

292
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:26,009
need to have a control system to be able

293
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,300
to remove some illegal post so each it's

294
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,600
not itself can decide what he wants to

295
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,510
do with the post the user just seems

296
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,050
senior it like they are saying okay

297
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,930
something which is maybe helical is on

298
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,660
your server and the administrator can

299
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,240
decide if you think you should remove it

300
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,790
or not and especially all server are

301
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,620
spread all over the world so the lows

302
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,750
for example in France or Germany are

303
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,019
different than the USA ones and if you

304
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,990
want to host a server somewhere in

305
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,449
Taiwan or with a no-loss country that

306
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,589
you can do whatever you want so this is

307
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,079
a quick screenshot of the whole design

308
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,480
from the previous major version and the

309
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,730
new one I just wanted to show you how it

310
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,100
looks I don't have time to do a demo but

311
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,769
we can talk about it later or you can

312
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,690
just go on pod and register and you will

313
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,860
see and I wanted to point that with we

314
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,560
did a really big big work last year to

315
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,550
rewrite the would just prop protocol to

316
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,130
extract it from the core and so you it

317
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,310
is not available as a ruby gem so

318
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,920
library you you can include inside the

319
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,750
project and we are not the only one

320
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,430
speaking this protocol the fryin teacher

321
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,430
and the RevZilla projects are still are

322
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,019
talking

323
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,630
jaspera too so we know called the the

324
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,270
protocol the Federation and we try to

325
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,419
remove all the jaspera specific world

326
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,980
inside the protocol the protocol itself

327
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,140
is not referring to jasper anymore it's

328
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,049
something which has been extract and I

329
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,750
unn courage you to have a look the the

330
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,880
complete specification are available of

331
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,020
course everything is open and you can

332
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,809
switch your project if you maybe I don't

333
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,110
know I depending on what you do and we

334
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,950
we have a website called the Federation

335
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,440
that Mpho that I'm really signing

336
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,320
currently which is a list of all the

337
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,210
nodes which exists and is speaking the

338
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,070
just prop vertical so you you've got

339
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,360
several project listed under

340
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,559
and shout what expect for the futures

341
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,520
well we are full of ideas unfortunately

342
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,730
we are all volunteers so we need more

343
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,900
resources and more time maybe but big

344
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,150
things are coming especially senior

345
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,150
right here is working and the migration

346
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,970
things because we this is also a core

347
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,700
value but we it's really hard to build

348
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,590
in the decentralized world but the idea

349
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,990
is to be able to say I want to live this

350
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,990
nut and grab every information I have

351
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,270
with me every messages that post on my

352
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,490
contact information and to be able to

353
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,820
grab that and put it in another node for

354
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,669
example you can say oh I will try Jasper

355
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:37,470
I don't have time to instil it so you

356
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,409
register on premise fear and you use it

357
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,720
for several months you say ok I like it

358
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,150
but now I want to host myself so you

359
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,460
will be able to grab all your data and

360
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,039
inside your home just prop put it on it

361
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,770
and restart like everything never to

362
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,090
likely if you started on your your node

363
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,760
at the beginning so that's really

364
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,299
important for us and I can't create you

365
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,210
to to come and contribute if you if you

366
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,240
want to help just to welcome some new

367
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,870
here people is always something very

368
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,789
very valuable all right thank you

369
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,299
this is all the the URL well you can

370
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,610
find most of the information about just

371
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,860
brought out the official website and the

372
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,110
code on github and the list of nodes at

373
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,939
the Federation thank you

374
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,090
I don't how many time we have for

375
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,820
Christians but five minutes okay yep two

376
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,430
questions in fact one is a promise for

377
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,090
[Music]

378
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,900
ya and the second one is also relates

379
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,090
MPP would it be possible in the future

380
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,190
to send host why am i its MPP client

381
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,170
yeah so I read posts using an XMPP

382
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,810
client instead of for that side so the

383
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,270
question is about the integration of

384
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,630
XMPP inside Jastrow for so first of all

385
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,030
the chat right now is not in a stable

386
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,570
state so from a sphere is way too big to

387
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,280
put a better feature on it at the moment

388
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,560
but it will be activity that as soon as

389
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,160
it's ready I'm right on the started blog

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,960
about the XMPP integration itself we're

391
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,000
using SEM PP for the real-time chat it

392
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
is already possible to what we do is

393
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,180
just to link the database of jaspera to

394
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,070
be able to log in to XMPP with your

395
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,200
username and your password so if you use

396
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,930
I don't know pidgin and you you're part

397
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,630
of XMPP enabled you will be able to log

398
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,460
inside pidgin directly and to chat with

399
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,550
all the person using XMPP you're not

400
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,140
stuck to it just for a user of course

401
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,270
but the message is that ya know this is

402
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,430
not going to happen hi because like

403
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,330
really XMPP is is nice to do chat and

404
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,650
other things but it has some flows which

405
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,110
is not really the good idea to write a

406
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,200
social network backs on XMPP I know I

407
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,120
know pretty well the guys behind a

408
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,640
cellulites were behind moving there is

409
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,270
nice social project trying to use XMPP

410
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,690
and definitely there there should be a

411
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,340
lot of he thought to do that and I don't

412
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,760
think it was it at the moment yes

413
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:58,050
yeah which Dennis - would you shut down

414
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,480
[Music]

415
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,010
well the point yeah so the point is

416
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,890
about a censorship by shutting down gns

417
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,010
I talked about facebook.com because

418
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,040
Facebook desk dot-com is only one server

419
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,440
one domain name so if you start this one

420
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,600
then nobody can use Facebook anymore

421
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,210
really just for I like the email if you

422
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,990
if you stop gmail.com if you stop Orange

423
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,870
and free and all the Yahoo and maybe out

424
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,050
mail everyone was still using emails you

425
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,610
see what I mean you cannot shut down the

426
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,410
email if you shut down a domain name I

427
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,960
will just be able to buy another one and

428
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,090
point it to my server and that's it so

429
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,169
yeah we can talk about it after that

430
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,880
yeah so the IPA is currently we already

431
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,940
work a lot on it and we'll specification

432
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,600
of the API is is written so we have the

433
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,900
the idea oh it it will be but the code

434
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,080
itself is not done yet jaspera is

435
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:26,710
already an and I was a provider of I was

436
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,640
I lost it

437
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,230
open ID thank you yeah so there is

438
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,430
already the identification part which is

439
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,080
quite working and there is still works

440
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,120
going on but the the IP I is not ready

441
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,980
yet but the specification out there so

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,470
if you want to be prepared to write an

443
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,180
application for just bra you can already

444
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,780
have a look and we welcome feedback to

445
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,850
of course yes

446
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,590
so the question is about the data being

447
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,900
cop ID to us on nodes of the network so

448
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,590
the answer is the texts are pushed but

449
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,350
not the the important data like images

450
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,530
so if you if you publish a posting look

451
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,560
at my pictures you will it will be

452
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,090
encrypted sent to other nodes on where

453
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,370
you have contact only the one you're

454
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,950
talking to they will receive the message

455
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,920
and be able to decrypt it and then they

456
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,650
will have URL to the images they bet the

457
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,650
image is stay on unit so that if you

458
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,420
removed it nobody has access on it

459
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,090
anymore all right

460
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,470
so time's up everybody I'm sorry I can

461
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,780
answer a question after that thank you

462
00:24:50,780 --> 00:25:01,149
very well and so see you there
