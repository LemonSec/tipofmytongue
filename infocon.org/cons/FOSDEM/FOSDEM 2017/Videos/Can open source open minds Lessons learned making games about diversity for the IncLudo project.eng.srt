1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
this is

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,529
so I can open source open minds lessons

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,480
learned making games about diversity for

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,690
the in crudo project my name is Jesse

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,389
and before I begin I like to apologize

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,520
this is not a Tech Talk so if you're

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,210
expecting a Tech Talk

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,080
anyway so but I am gonna tell you about

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,720
stuff that I find really fascinating

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,619
stuff that I've been learning when I've

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,330
been making a games about diversity and

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,400
I hope that you find it interesting too

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,489
okay so like I was saying my name is

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,200
Jesse I work at the Cree game lab so the

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,899
Cree is a center for research and

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,120
interdisciplinary interdisciplinarity

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,420
sorry it's hard to say in Paris and at

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,550
the game lab we make open games for

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,059
science social change and infra

20
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,850
Education so we create games with

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,710
usually we team up with researchers and

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,120
teachers and we create games with them

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,629
we teach we teach we teach game design

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,610
and in particular we have a really cool

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,830
summer school that we call glass where

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,229
we mix science students and game design

27
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,060
students over the summer in order to

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,799
have them make science games together so

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,909
we've been running that for a few years

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,479
is pretty fun and finally we have we do

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,310
some community events so we have this

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,409
club called the gaming da but Pedro is

33
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,820
talking about earlier where people come

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,290
and they give talks about game design

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,900
about educational games and all sorts of

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,240
stuff related that most of the talks are

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
online on YouTube some are in French

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,590
some are in English it should be pretty

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,759
clear when you find them so if you're

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,189
interested don't don't um don't hesitate

41
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,829
to check out that our YouTube channel

42
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,439
all right so this project began when

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
these two guys these two brothers Hilmi

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,479
and sue B who worked for who started a

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,299
small start-up and social

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,180
entrepreneurship in India approached the

47
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
creeks and said that they wanted to make

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,369
games with us that promote diversity and

49
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,290
inclusion in the workplace in India so

50
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,640
you know I said hey that's a great idea

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,159
you know I mean I don't know anything

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,079
about diversity or inclusion and I've

53
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,209
never been to India but you know let's

54
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,619
do it right how are you how hard could

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,890
it possibly be

56
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,670
and so it turns out that diversity is

57
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,010
very dangerous okay and this is true

58
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,900
studies showed that it can cause

59
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,960
discomfort create rougher interactions

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,470
create a lack of trust greater perceived

61
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,450
interpersonal conflict lower

62
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,670
communication have less cohesion in a

63
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,770
group and more concern about being

64
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,410
disrespected so why are we trying to do

65
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,910
games about diversity again what's

66
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,860
what's the point well it turns out that

67
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,410
diversity is also very advantageous for

68
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,780
organizations obviously it also is

69
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,550
advantageous for a society as a whole

70
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,290
but I won't even argue that point just

71
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,380
for organizations to be diverse actually

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,510
brings them a great advantage and

73
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,770
there's all sorts of studies that have

74
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,670
shown this it's really interesting

75
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,489
there's stuff that diversity brings so

76
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,050
the most obvious thing is that okay

77
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,820
you're a diverse group you have did

78
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,080
people have different viewpoints that

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,790
come right that makes sense but what's

80
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,500
really interesting is that the dynamics

81
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,739
of the group changes when you have

82
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,510
change when you have people from

83
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,580
different backgrounds so people actually

84
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,180
share information better than they would

85
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,670
perhaps because if you're was someone

86
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,709
who you think is very similar to you you

87
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,209
might not think that you really have to

88
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,860
talk about something because it's

89
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,320
obvious they already know it right but

90
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,670
if you if you don't trust that they

91
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,780
really know what you're talking about

92
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,060
then you're gonna put it out and if you

93
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,440
think that somebody has a different

94
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,150
viewpoint than you you actually do a

95
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,220
better job arguing your viewpoint which

96
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,320
means you do more research you back up

97
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,000
your thinking you think about what

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,110
you're gonna say before you say it

99
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,480
whereas if you're with people who you

100
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
know you generally all agree you don't

101
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,750
do that it you just get lazy and you

102
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,360
just say what you want to say you know

103
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,510
and on the flip side of that to people

104
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,630
with differing opinions her dissenting

105
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,310
opinions are actually more likely to

106
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,430
bring them up in a group that's diverse

107
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,380
so once again if you're in a group that

108
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,700
with everyone else that's pretty much

109
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,750
like you you generally try to stick with

110
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,940
that like like you part and you won't

111
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,310
bring up the oh this might not work you

112
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,810
know kind of a viewpoint which can be

113
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,470
very important all right it is shown in

114
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,910
the corporate world to lead for better

115
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,240
performance companies make more money

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,220
when they have in particularly it's been

117
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,100
study with having females on corporate

118
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,760
boards for example and in the scientific

119
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,320
world it turns out that scientific

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,930
papers written by groups of authors that

121
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,479
are diverse are cited more and have

122
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,130
higher impact factors which is another

123
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,889
kind of cool cool element and there's a

124
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,900
third reason I think that probably big

125
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,190
companies have started to care about

126
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,160
this which is to avoid really bad PR I

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,410
don't know who remembers this thing with

128
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,440
Google photos when it rolled out was it

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,449
two years ago and it was missing

130
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,870
identifying people as gorillas and you

131
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,460
know obviously right knowing things like

132
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,229
Google's out to do that right that's not

133
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,699
there that's not what they're trying to

134
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,500
do but it does indicate well how come

135
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,389
they didn't pick that up right and we

136
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,860
don't really know but we can suspect

137
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,449
that the reason they didn't notice it

138
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,310
before it rolled out is maybe the people

139
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,130
testing and doing the QA we're not that

140
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,570
background didn't have that skin color

141
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,490
weren't from that part of the world and

142
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,590
maybe there's a reason that they also to

143
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,520
have never seen okay so okay so

144
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,080
diversity is so good

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,610
that's do it what's what's the problem

146
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,229
right and in fact I think most people

147
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,000
would agree with that point most people

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,229
would agree with that one and the

149
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:33,460
current political climate maybe not

150
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,289
everyone agree with that point but I

151
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,940
think a lot of people would think well

152
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,830
you know we've moved on right like we

153
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,539
know diversity is good we know people

154
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:41,680
are different than us it doesn't mean

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,470
that they're inferior so you know okay

156
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,950
it's good the problem is that that's not

157
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,780
actually even if we think that way

158
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,970
that's not the way we're really thinking

159
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,940
because it turns out that as this as the

160
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,160
quote goes we are not feeling beings who

161
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,530
think oh sorry we are feeling beings who

162
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,979
think not thinking beings who feel which

163
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,300
means primarily we are driven by

164
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,030
emotions and our thinking can be all

165
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,180
kind of wacky afterwards and in fact

166
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,160
even the fact that where we make

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,870
decisions and our reasons behind the

168
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,840
decisions may largely be thought up

169
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,479
after the fact that's been studied too

170
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,340
so people will tend to make decisions

171
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,490
and then you justify why you said that

172
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,710
right so you make decision first you

173
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,930
know explain later so that obviously

174
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,450
doesn't lead to making really good

175
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,010
decisions where you're taking in all the

176
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,680
information

177
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,900
fact is there are researchers who

178
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,370
suggest that the ability to reason did

179
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,180
not come from is not motivated to make

180
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,190
really good decisions but rather to

181
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,400
convince other people to join us you

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,050
want to do which is really crazy which

183
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,240
means that basically once again we're

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,520
making a decision then we're justifying

185
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,870
it and then we're going to explain it

186
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,639
really well so that we other people can

187
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,449
agree with us so that's kind of scary

188
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,699
and in particular it's least all sorts

189
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,610
of bias so the there's different kinds

190
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,349
of bias probably the main one that we

191
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,020
talk about is called confirmation bias

192
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,009
so that's what they talk about a lot

193
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,410
nowadays involving the news it means

194
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,500
that when you get new information and it

195
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,180
agrees with what you've already thought

196
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,090
then you tend to accept it that's true

197
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,090
if you get information that goes against

198
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,349
what you already thought you tend to

199
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,229
disregard it and if people confront you

200
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,180
with information that goes against what

201
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,460
you think often rather than changing

202
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,440
your mind you will probably double down

203
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,510
on what you believe and think that

204
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,190
there's some kind of like plot to try to

205
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,789
get you to change your mind and in terms

206
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,650
of stereotypes this comes down to people

207
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,570
right so you know categorizing people

208
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,000
based on what their skin their age how

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,560
tall they are how pretty they are

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,690
whatever kind of thing and make some

211
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,889
kind of judgment about the way they're

212
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,889
gonna act and in fact this is

213
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,930
interesting little sign know it's even

214
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,900
been studied that when we see people who

215
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,030
we consider very inferior to ourselves

216
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,130
we actually the part of our brains that

217
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,630
light up is not the part having to do

218
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,280
with people but rather the part having

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,560
to do with objects which means we are

220
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
capable of literally seeing people as

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,990
objects you know yes you cannot make

222
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,970
such a straightforward assumption that

223
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,669
this is based on this papers are not

224
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,899
significant in the way we see people

225
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,578
okay I don't know that's what I've

226
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,500
understood so far obviously the two

227
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,909
things can go hand-in-hand you can have

228
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,799
bias against area against groups of

229
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,649
people okay so it actually makes sense

230
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,449
why we act this way right our brains

231
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,399
have evolved for a certain reason most

232
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,050
we don't know for sure but most most

233
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,459
likely it's because we need to make

234
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,529
decisions quickly especially in a more

235
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,850
kind of wild situation where there's

236
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,440
predators there's different groups of

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,850
people maybe there were reasons to be

238
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,470
scared of other groups of people and it

239
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,670
made sense to try to run away or

240
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,079
something that okay so get back to the

241
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,050
workplace in the workplace obviously if

242
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,490
you want a diverse workplace well you

243
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,940
have to hire diverse people okay and

244
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,839
some of the interesting studies they've

245
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,360
done have involved sending out CDs so

246
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,130
some of the Renda there put out resumes

247
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,529
that are exactly identical except for

248
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,029
the name on the top so in this

249
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,180
particular study there was they had one

250
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,310
one person was named one fake resume was

251
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,319
for John and one fake resume was for

252
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,079
Jennifer they sent these out at

253
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,730
university laboratories to be hired by

254
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,940
faculty members right and in this case

255
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,029
the it turns out that Jennifer

256
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,089
attendance okay Jennifer would be was

257
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,329
judged less competent would not be as

258
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,220
hired as often and if they were hired

259
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,920
wouldn't be paid as much so that's kind

260
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,199
of that's kind of scary too okay and if

261
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,300
you think the hiring based on CVS is bad

262
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,819
well it turns out that interviews are

263
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,240
much worse in fact some people suggest

264
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,529
that interviews are probably the worst

265
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,360
way to hire people because it's when you

266
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,769
have the most bias because you're

267
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,300
communicating with them if you come down

268
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,519
you talk about stuff that you enjoy in

269
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,990
common and you're not judging them based

270
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,380
on what they what they need to be doing

271
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,540
okay just a quick side note really

272
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,550
interesting example they've done is for

273
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,410
orchestras so it used to be in the u.s.

274
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,449
there are very few females in orchestras

275
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,420
I think it said in 1970 was less than 5%

276
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,889
and the way they got around this is

277
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,120
doing he's blind he's blind

278
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,779
what's it called when you're getting

279
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,759
hired I can't think of a minute blind

280
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,699
blind recitals so people had come they

281
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:36,990
put up a curtain and they play behind

282
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,420
the curtain and actually at some point

283
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,149
in some orchestras they make people take

284
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,100
off their shoes because there was a

285
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,920
thing could

286
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,360
people could hear when he was a woman

287
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,339
walking when it was a man walking it's

288
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,880
just it's crazy okay so let's go on to

289
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,339
games so when we started this project

290
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,980
making games to promote diversity we

291
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,360
started with the assumption that most of

292
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,190
ideas were not going to be very good and

293
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,579
that we needed to so the our conclusion

294
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,649
is that we need to try a lot so

295
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,230
basically we structured our project so

296
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,449
that we started with prototypes a bunch

297
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,269
then we cut them down to just four

298
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,070
that's what we're doing now and we're

299
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,420
going to be developing them for the next

300
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,089
year and then putting them out there all

301
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,290
our projects well it's open source

302
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,779
otherwise it wouldn't be here we also do

303
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,459
we're going to put out all a data as

304
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,260
open data so all the analytics we get

305
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,829
back and the process itself is open

306
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,449
we're trying to put put it all on our

307
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,310
blog so people can reproduce our ideas

308
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,899
try different things that we didn't do

309
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,199
etc okay so we started with game jams

310
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,329
and with working with people with the

311
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,269
organizations that we're gonna be out

312
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,800
and this was I was going to go through

313
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,779
all the different ideas that we tried

314
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,300
but I'm not gonna have time so we tried

315
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,279
abstract platformers online comic

316
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,470
captions five-minute debates about

317
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,660
celebrities automatic stereotype

318
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,120
generators a whole lot different stuff

319
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,100
and we put out these things out there we

320
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
had our people our testers in India try

321
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,589
them and rank them based on how engaging

322
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,360
they thought they were and how much they

323
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
learned and based on that we picked

324
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,890
these four games so one of them is a

325
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,209
let's see so hired is a game where you

326
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,890
we kind of we kind of teach about bias

327
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,769
so we give people biases and you have to

328
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,170
hire someone and so you you pick up

329
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,610
cards and everyone's trying to hide

330
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,260
their bias because if someone else finds

331
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,360
out they're out of the game and so there

332
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,680
you come up with these really funny

333
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,240
arguments where you're kind of trying

334
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,649
not to say why you don't want to hire

335
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,209
women because you have to come up with

336
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,640
funny things it works uh pretty well in

337
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,190
my state is a game for about learning

338
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,350
about different regions of India it's

339
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,880
too hard for me but for people who live

340
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,550
there they can they can play it this is

341
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,810
kind of a weird physical game where you

342
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,800
pretend to be pirates

343
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,060
that all have different physical

344
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,279
handicaps and you have to play a

345
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,870
cooperative game and

346
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,030
another day is a visual novel that we're

347
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,910
creating now about being a manager head

348
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,780
up oh sorry I lost my phone one second

349
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,220
all right so don't have a lot of time

350
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,510
but I just wanted to say a few things

351
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,460
that we learned with this process so far

352
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,550
so one thing is that we've learned to

353
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,640
favor concrete ideas over abstract ones

354
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,350
once again based on the assumption that

355
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,470
the the abstract things people might

356
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,000
agree in the abstract about diversity

357
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,010
but might not act that way in a concrete

358
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,430
decision-making process we found that

359
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,340
getting people to talk is really really

360
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,290
really valuable and that for that bird

361
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,360
games actually surprisingly good so when

362
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,830
we started this we're going to make only

363
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,660
video games and then it turns out most

364
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,040
people wanted board games you can play

365
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,260
them but they actually also work well

366
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,820
for a company like you bring everyone in

367
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,740
to a meeting room you put a board game

368
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,600
on a table people can start to play and

369
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
then or a card game you know or other

370
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
kind of tabletop game people you know

371
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,280
can start to discuss all this happened

372
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,290
to me this happened in my aunt you know

373
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,050
you can start discussing things that way

374
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,580
we also found that in general people

375
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,530
really do like to find out about each

376
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,570
other and they also like to share things

377
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,010
about themselves it's just that you know

378
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,960
it's a little scary and you're worried

379
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,790
about being judged and so by putting

380
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,170
them in the game context where they feel

381
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,570
comfortable you can make that process a

382
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,490
lot easier

383
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,980
all right in terms of the process we

384
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,420
found that game jams are really

385
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,150
fantastic as a way to start come up with

386
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,500
lots of different ideas and try a lot of

387
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,100
things out we found that using paper

388
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,140
prototypes are really great too so even

389
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,090
for video games did not just code

390
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,280
something but to do stuff on paper and

391
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,080
try to make a board game that would act

392
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,360
like the final video game is a great

393
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,920
process because it's really quick and

394
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,480
you can change the rules you can change

395
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
the rules like 10 times in an hour and

396
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,140
you don't have to you know each you

397
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,820
could never do with with well maybe

398
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,050
you're if you're incredible coder you

399
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,050
could on the flip side that's hard for

400
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,820
other people to accept sometimes if you

401
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,350
have a paper prototype people don't take

402
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,300
you seriously so that's you know it's a

403
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,310
little harder that way

404
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,459
okay and having a diverse team obviously

405
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,649
also makes a big difference this seems

406
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,540
very obvious but actually when we were

407
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,420
starting the project we were mostly guys

408
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,790
and none of us were from India so we you

409
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,019
know we thought oh it's so cool we're

410
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,519
gonna work with the Indian partner it

411
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,690
won't be a problem they'll teach us

412
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,760
stuff but there's stuff that's hard too

413
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,279
hard to learn on your own and so as we

414
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,720
started hiring more people who are

415
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,459
Indian who are women and made things a

416
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,740
lot easier

417
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,620
so in conclusion diversity and inclusion

418
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,019
are good things for organizations and

419
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,889
that over time our bias has moved from

420
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,420
something that we you know it's just out

421
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,490
there some overt thing into some

422
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,750
implicit thing that's within ourselves

423
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,880
that is harder to address for that

424
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,500
reason because people don't think that

425
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,180
they're biased we all none of us think

426
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,500
that we're biased we all think that

427
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,560
we're very rational games have been

428
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,620
shown to to help people tackle difficult

429
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,139
subjects and we found that icebreaker

430
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,120
and tabletop games are really great for

431
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,339
getting people to start to discuss and

432
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,899
finally with prototyping is a great way

433
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,180
to start any process like that

434
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,040
so to get back to the original question

435
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,310
about can games really improve diversity

436
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,890
and inclusion in the workplace my answer

437
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,560
is you have to wait and hopefully I'll

438
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,449
tell you next year okay thank you very

439
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,569
much

440
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,570
and I think we have time for questions

441
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,400
so that's good I rushed a little bit

442
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:35,520
because that's okay any any questions in

443
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,589
the game you mentioned about having to

444
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,730
hide your bias okay okay so the way it

445
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,130
works is that you pretend that you're

446
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,070
you pretend that you're all management

447
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,690
at a company and that you have to hire

448
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,270
somebody for a position okay and then

449
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,400
you show it's a random random right now

450
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,720
it's cards and then we're gonna move it

451
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,670
to a mobile game but right now it's a

452
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,020
cards and so you see the people with us

453
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,260
for the fake CV and then everyone has a

454
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,060
secret bias card so for example mine

455
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,740
maybe is like you know you don't want to

456
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,480
hire a woman maybe someone else does

457
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,520
don't want to hire I know Muslims or

458
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,230
something like that and then what you do

459
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,359
is you argue about who you should hire

460
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,160
and you don't want to hire the person

461
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,679
that you're bias is about but but if you

462
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,390
truly obvious and I'm like yeah you know

463
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,949
I don't know she's going to go on

464
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,510
parental leave at some point well then

465
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,220
they'll know that that's my bias and so

466
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,410
they can call me out etc and you try to

467
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,540
like get the UM so you're trying to

468
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,370
fight for it but without really putting

469
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,850
it in the discussions that come out are

470
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:43,800
really funny for the game jams are in in

471
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,110
the origin oh yes okay so it's very two

472
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,670
very different things so let me just go

473
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,280
back to this slide real quick um that

474
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,950
we're talking about oh say I'm supposed

475
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,690
to repeat the questions and I forgot

476
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,120
myself so the question was about the

477
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,559
recruitment process for the different

478
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,179
events so when we were in India we we

479
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,830
basically did like board game making

480
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,950
events with the different groups that

481
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,530
zmq who is our Indian partner is in

482
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,800
touch with so there's companies there's

483
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,110
nonprofit organizations and there's and

484
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,970
there's also government like parts of

485
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,260
the government so these are basically

486
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,480
contacts of theirs that were interested

487
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,160
in promoting diversity in their

488
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,910
workplace and in Paris what we've done

489
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,740
is more kind of use their getting a

490
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,720
community of people who are

491
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
student making games maybe don't know so

492
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,559
much about diversity although that's not

493
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,820
totally true there are people who really

494
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,429
do and kind of get them say okay let's

495
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,020
make games for over the weekend and you

496
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,929
know and okay well for the key on

497
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,850
shooting how many I think for the Paris

498
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,500
one it's around was like around 50

499
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,610
people or something like that I would

500
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,130
say forty to fifty yeah yeah and then

501
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,900
but for in India we've done smaller

502
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,610
things we've done it also at school with

503
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,840
a bunch of students yeah

504
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:08,800
any other questions yes the question is

505
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,320
how do you measure the impact so that's

506
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,730
really hard it's really hard because

507
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,410
there's a few different things you could

508
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,240
you could try to measure the impact of

509
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,450
the game in terms of what people learned

510
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,700
and that is difficult in itself you have

511
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,980
to have very specialized standards

512
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,890
questionnaires and the other attempt is

513
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,390
to try to see what the organization's

514
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,670
actually do in real life so that's what

515
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,100
nmq is planning on doing so their basic

516
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,960
is the idea to see if the management

517
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,160
makes any changes in their procedures so

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,270
because I didn't talk about that but

519
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,110
there's a lot of things that

520
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,090
organizations can do to try to promote

521
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,800
diversity in the workplace it's not just

522
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,870
like you know talk about how good

523
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,130
diversity it is there's like very

524
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,600
concrete things you know like that you

525
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,550
can do so you can make the hiring

526
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,560
process more open you can make people

527
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,570
have to write down everything they want

528
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,270
about a candidate before looking at the

529
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,930
CVS and that way you can argue it

530
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,650
actually if you're interested in that

531
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,790
there's a really fantastic talk by an HR

532
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,620
researcher at Google called something

533
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,950
bias diversity diversity Google or

534
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,630
something like that and its really

535
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,950
fantastic and you go through all these

536
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,990
different hiring practices that they've

537
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,080
done at Google to make it better if so

538
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,000
for example on the on the interview

539
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,130
thing they basically are trying to get

540
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,830
rid of a typical interview where you

541
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,850
would just kind of talk to the person

542
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,410
and ask them questions and they've

543
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,210
replaced it with like a script so like

544
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,920
you know this is the first question and

545
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,530
then the answers are this this or this

546
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,850
you know and these ones are good and

547
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,710
these ones are bad now the next question

548
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,910
you know and the answers of this

549
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,860
business which is it's kind of strange

550
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,660
because it feels very robotic you know

551
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,100
it's like well we're replacing people

552
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,930
with you know an algorithm but at the

553
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,730
same time it does get rid of the bias

554
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,470
right because if something is

555
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,940
standardized and you it's not about that

556
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,830
yes maybe I'll go to him first since

557
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,640
you've already asked a question if

558
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,940
that's okay

559
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:45,010
yes okay okay yeah so so the question

560
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,590
was about competitive versus cooperative

561
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,400
games so in this okay so just a quick

562
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,370
thing about competition and cooperation

563
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,660
what's cool is that both things can go

564
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,240
nicely together like typically in team

565
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,790
games there's a cooperation between the

566
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,140
people on the team and there's a

567
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,460
competitive thing between the teams

568
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,200
right and that's an element where you

569
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,130
can mix it I wouldn't agree that

570
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,540
competition is bad like by itself

571
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,210
because I feel like there is there's it

572
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,740
is something that motivates us and as

573
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,300
long as it's within a game context where

574
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,040
we understand we're in a game we're

575
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,630
competing in the game and when we get

576
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,040
out of the game we're not competing in

577
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,360
the same way I think I think it's

578
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,770
acceptable in these particular games

579
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,910
sorry I mean skip to the ones that I

580
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,570
picked yeah higher it is competitive

581
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,929
pirate prep - this one is

582
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,130
non-competitive right now but when we

583
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,380
tried it in India they kept saying we

584
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,150
want a scoring system we want to be able

585
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,770
to know if we're better than the other

586
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,690
ones we're thinking about making it

587
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,059
competitive just to kind of bad people

588
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:47,980
so have people playing a team but once

589
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,270
again have the teams compete you know

590
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,800
how many cars did you get through that

591
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,650
kind of thing this is a visual novel

592
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,540
it's used play on your own so it's not

593
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,480
competitive and pin my state you could

594
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,190
play competitively if you wanted but you

595
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,570
don't have to it's more like an

596
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,560
icebreaker so

597
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,930
mave time for one more question yeah I

598
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,940
just wanted to respond to that in

599
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,700
another way to me diversity is from the

600
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,290
mental of life I mean you don't have

601
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,260
diversity you have that natural process

602
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,840
that applies quite many social processes

603
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,270
some curious why you promote diversity

604
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,230
as a competitive behavior because

605
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,120
vomited in the womanís as a competitive

606
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,360
asset was on the contrary I think it's

607
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,330
pretty much the competition that kills

608
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,070
diversities I find there is a bit of a

609
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,930
column yes so so there was an

610
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,200
observation about how diversity is

611
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,940
something that creates can create

612
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,710
cooperation if understand quickly and

613
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,670
why are we trying to promote

614
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,430
competitivity which is as a why are we

615
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,900
trying to promote diversity as something

616
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,000
that's competitive as an advantage I

617
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,520
guess the reason that if you're trying

618
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,170
to bring diversity into an existing

619
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,420
social structure made of companies that

620
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,090
are competing then it makes sense to

621
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,460
sell it to them as a competitive thing I

622
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,840
guess that's the answer it's more like

623
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,750
utilitarian than anything else if you

624
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,040
were in a different social structure

625
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,780
where you could be people would be much

626
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,550
more collaborative and I think it would

627
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:17,430
be it'd be wonderful all right maybe we

628
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,600
should stop there well thank you very

629
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,870
much

630
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,929
you
