1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,270
so hi everyone my name is Nick Missoula

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,969
I hope you can hear me okay I'm doing a

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,670
talk on studying the new score design

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,980
team it's more than talk almost

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,160
succumbed then what has been because

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,800
it's just starting out so what is new

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,279
score a new score is this scoring

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,279
program where you can write scores edit

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,190
scores sheriff scores it has an online

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,660
platform as well that you could share

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,790
scores to and that you can download

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,620
scores from so my goal wasn't just to

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,650
start a design team for a new score it

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,450
was also to figure out how to do user

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,420
centered design effectively in volunteer

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,790
based communities I used to be a

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,640
volunteer in the user experience design

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,540
team for LibreOffice so I had some

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,320
experience with that and I feel like

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,460
consistently not just with LibreOffice

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,860
but with various open source design

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,100
teams one thing that felt like was

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,159
missing was the user there was not

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,640
enough research being done there often

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,700
wasn't a solid basis for some decisions

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,560
being made a lot of designers were

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,850
making decisions based on their own

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,240
experience without doing research and I

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,960
haven't really seen user research being

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,470
done on a larger basis and open source

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,110
projects I'm also working part-time as a

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,159
user experience designer

33
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,190
I'm studying some subjects in

34
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,290
human-computer interaction so I was

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,369
coming from that as well and and this is

36
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,040
a book that I was basing a lot of the

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,960
processes that I tried to incorporate

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,650
and then I'm gonna try to incorporate

39
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,570
into the design team it's designing for

40
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,310
the digital age it was written by Kim

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,890
Goodwin who used to be vice president at

42
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,250
Cooper Cooper's one of the largest and

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,409
most famous design consultancies and

44
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,479
it's a really huge book and it's very

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,950
detailed and it goes through the entire

46
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,659
process of user experience design user

47
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,690
centered

48
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,860
design so when I say user centered

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,590
design what do I mean well wikipedia

50
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,970
defines it as a framework of processes

51
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,010
in which the means wants the limitations

52
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,930
of end users are given extensive

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,990
attention at each stage that means that

54
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,420
you do research at the beginning then

55
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,170
that research usually have personas

56
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,120
which are you take the data from that

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,560
research and make fictional fictional

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,450
people fictional characters that

59
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,430
exemplify the patterns that you found in

60
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,910
in that research that you did and then

61
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,760
once you start designing you test you

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
keep testing you validate hypotheses you

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,370
make sure that what you're making is

64
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,020
being actually useful to the people that

65
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,730
you're making it for and you keep the

66
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,340
personas in mind throughout the whole

67
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,240
process and why is this important well

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,280
let's everyone understand the needs

69
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,620
their workflows and the mental matters

70
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,600
of the people involved in them whatever

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,830
you're designing so that basically makes

72
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,040
you able to understand how what kind

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,989
what different kinds of people are using

74
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,580
your software it's not just you it's not

75
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,170
just your surroundings it makes you

76
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,270
aware of who all is using your software

77
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,320
and it also gives you a better

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,269
perspective on what the needs are you're

79
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,220
not just copying competition it gets the

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,660
whole team thinking about the target

81
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,400
users it makes it clear who the core

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,010
target users are and aren't you know who

83
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,670
you're designing for there's a concept

84
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,040
called the elastic user which is

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,670
basically sometimes you can arguments

86
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,400
from developers oh we need I don't know

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,970
we definitely need a wizard for this

88
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,070
because it's just too hard but then at

89
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,730
other times

90
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,140
oh it's fine you know they'll figure it

91
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,850
out because they're clever and then they

92
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,470
can look through documentation right and

93
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,820
so you have these opposing views on who

94
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,699
the user

95
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,610
and it's the same user and you're

96
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,650
designing you know you have a very

97
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,199
schizophrenic interface if you're

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,750
designing that way the personas help you

99
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,360
keep bounded on who the actual users are

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,979
going to be and where their needs are

101
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:51,510
and it resolves arguments so if you have

102
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,090
data to back up your arguments then it's

103
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,030
much easier to resolve them what I did

104
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,570
sorry

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,780
and and it also helps you keep leg up on

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,570
the competition because you actually

107
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,950
know the means you're not just stopping

108
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,910
blindly what the others are doing and so

109
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,680
what I tried to do is get a local meetup

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,210
running first of all I wasn't really

111
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,120
experienced with running something

112
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,290
locally I've only been volunteering

113
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,070
web-based design communities and there

114
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,200
were a lot of inefficiencies in doing

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,310
things on the web in communication and

116
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,500
setting times so I was wondering what's

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,139
it gonna be like if you do it locally so

118
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,450
I studied to meetup.com the idea was to

119
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,370
you know start with me so you start

120
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,250
doing research as a first step get some

121
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,020
personas as I mentioned and then once we

122
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,580
have the preserves ready the personas

123
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,560
would be the basis of everything and

124
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
would inform all the design going

125
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,050
forward we just start solving user

126
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,440
experience problems you know we do some

127
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,380
the process was you do some testing at

128
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,940
the beginning or you'd look for some

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,870
hypotheses or

130
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,330
you know people would have some ideas of

131
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,669
what the bugs were maybe you have some

132
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,830
bugs in the buck tracker or you do

133
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,190
research and ideation for you know the

134
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,789
bugs that you identified then you use

135
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,250
your personas and put them in the Sun in

136
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,020
scenarios in which they're running into

137
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,220
this bug and try to find solutions for

138
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,889
personas in those scenarios then you do

139
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,190
some wireframes you test those maybe you

140
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,570
go to mock-up fees and test the mock-ups

141
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,010
themselves because sometimes you don't

142
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,910
need why framing phase it's easier

143
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,590
sometimes to just do the mock-ups and

144
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,950
then you do testing and once we figured

145
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,139
out oh okay this works for people we

146
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,600
move on to the next book so really a

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,590
straightforward process that can be

148
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,900
applied not just in new school but in

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,919
other communities as well

150
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,410
so it didn't go that bowl and it was

151
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,180
probably because I didn't really have

152
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,020
that much time to devote to it so this

153
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,690
is the first meeting where we set up you

154
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,030
know what was gonna be like or we talked

155
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,180
about what our plans are what the vision

156
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,840
is that was nice but then the next

157
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,830
meeting I had a set of four completely

158
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,260
different people so I didn't expect the

159
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,460
base to be quite so changeable but it

160
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,979
still kept going you know we did the

161
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,910
next time there were four of us some

162
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,260
from the first meeting some from the

163
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,600
second meeting and we did some sacred

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,250
interviews to find out what the

165
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,990
stakeholders were looking for who the

166
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,919
users were etc and then the next meeting

167
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,970
we had six people and that was I think I

168
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,389
think this is it and we were still doing

169
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,860
stakeholder interviews we were talking

170
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,720
about the user experience design process

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,600
in general and it seems to be working

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
relatively well people who people seem

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,219
to be motivated because these people

174
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,860
they were coming into it because he

175
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,089
wanted to learn the user experience

176
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,909
design process they didn't we have

177
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,690
experience with it so it was interesting

178
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,310
to them but at the same time they didn't

179
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,640
have that much time to devote which

180
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,130
actually showed up afterwards we were

181
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,950
starting to do user research prep and

182
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,120
there weren't that many people coming

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,210
first yeah the next memory meeting you

184
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,490
had to be canceled the next meeting two

185
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,810
people came and we just talked about

186
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,140
user research and then the meeting

187
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,490
afterwards when you started people

188
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,580
preparing for user research you know who

189
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,980
we could where we could find people what

190
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,930
people are we looking for settled that

191
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,470
kind of stuff and that last meeting was

192
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,380
kind of a bit disorganized so it might

193
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,790
have discouraged people because nobody

194
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,030
came the next time and then the next

195
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,300
time again nobody came

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,610
and I wasn't really want to devote the

197
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,480
time to to it I had school I had work so

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,800
I put it on hey-hey hiatus for a while

199
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,810
and then started in January started up

200
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:51,290
again in January and this kind of

201
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,130
lukewarm it started out a bit slow but

202
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,200
at the same time we were able to have a

203
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,440
meet up we did do three interviews in

204
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,010
January and there's some problems with

205
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,130
the interviews so that makes me actually

206
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,000
inspired to do more work in terms of

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,110
teaching people how to do these or

208
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,560
interviews putting more effort into

209
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
resources because the interviews that we

210
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,620
had were more marketing driven and more

211
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,910
focus on the current software rather

212
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,580
than the users so that's where you are

213
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,700
now the lessons learned well I learned

214
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,890
that people really need resources and

215
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,580
that it's there's a shortage of quickly

216
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,580
digestible resources for people to use

217
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,900
and people to get involved right away

218
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,080
and if I show people designing for the

219
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,560
digital age it's such a huge complex

220
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,430
book that discourages them from

221
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,230
contributing so what I'd like to do now

222
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,380
is put more time and effort into into

223
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,090
the resources that there are and trying

224
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,890
to find resources so if you have any

225
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,580
tips let me know

226
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,870
so another thing volunteers come and go

227
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,590
I can't count on those same people to

228
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,570
keep contributing I have to be prepared

229
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,020
for you know new people coming in and

230
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,790
how to integrate them as fast as

231
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,400
possible maybe some easy hikes would be

232
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,890
would be good to get people integrated

233
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,210
people signed a specialist so you need

234
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,030
to also focus on motivation and keeping

235
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,600
them feeling like their time is being

236
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,420
used as as well as possible and the

237
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,100
people that are coming are generally and

238
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,690
experience so you really do need to

239
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,660
teach them how to do user experience

240
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,389
design these people that were coming to

241
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,980
the meetups will also not experience and

242
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,829
music music theories so that's also

243
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,569
something to keep in mind when you're

244
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,160
doing when you're working with a local

245
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,130
group feel you're less likely to find if

246
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,170
you have specialized software people who

247
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,579
are interested in that specialized

248
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,560
software so that's where online

249
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,750
communities really have the upper hand

250
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,990
because it's easier to find people so

251
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,199
going forward I'm going to be gathering

252
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,009
resources making more resources I'm

253
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,800
going to be trying to build a stronger

254
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,089
community something that I was missing

255
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,670
was another person to help me keep the

256
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,829
things going because I really was

257
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:38,420
running out of time I didn't really have

258
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,110
the time to devote to this and it would

259
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,519
be helpful to have someone else so if

260
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,380
there's anyone here who'd like to get

261
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,529
involved let me know especially if

262
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,329
you're more experienced but even if

263
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,699
you're not there's lots of stuff to do

264
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,319
and I'd like to actually do a mix of

265
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,089
offline and online communities because

266
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:03,649
both are very useful

267
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,170
I'd like to define the roles better

268
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,290
something that as I've mentioned I don't

269
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,000
really see user research being done

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,689
often and research researchers can

271
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:20,389
actually have a different set of set of

272
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:21,829
skills then you know your standard

273
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,920
interaction designer and that's

274
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,180
something that you could use different

275
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,819
people for right if somebody isn't

276
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,829
comfortable making wireframes isn't

277
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,380
comfortable you know going through you

278
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,509
know layout and graphic theory they can

279
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,240
do this they can ask questions they can

280
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,790
gather data they can make personas

281
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,110
that's a completely different and I

282
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,209
think in the open source world

283
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,060
relatively unexplored though that we

284
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,689
could have also research participants

285
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:55,699
you don't have to know anything you can

286
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,000
just participate in interviews and

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
we absolutely need those people so if

288
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,360
you have no skills and can talk then

289
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,579
yeah you're perfect for openers

290
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,899
volunteering and it was those different

291
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,810
visual designers of course if you have

292
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,889
experts people who know the domain

293
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,709
interaction designers designers as well

294
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,949
and I'd like to rate on the process a

295
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:27,870
bit more I mentioned the process before

296
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,730
now I'm also thinking about doing the UX

297
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,759
so I mean let's instead of doing

298
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,490
research up fronts and then making

299
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,069
personas from that you do porto personas

300
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,629
based on your assumptions of who the

301
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,949
users are going to be and then you

302
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,839
validate them then you basically grow

303
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,230
them into full-blown personas so you

304
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,120
start with the fictional characters but

305
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,889
over time they get validated through

306
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,370
actual research the benefit of that is

307
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,230
we could start working on the bugs right

308
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,569
away with an idea of who the users are

309
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,750
and then when we find the personas over

310
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,750
time and I want to aim for replicability

311
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,120
because I really like other open-source

312
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,250
communities to also focus more on user

313
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,680
research I think that's something that

314
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,149
you'd like to do in your community we

315
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,040
could connect up and find ways to

316
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,269
incorporate user research and testing

317
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,500
basically user centered design into an

318
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,639
existing design team or into a new

319
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,699
design team if you'd like to start one

320
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,709
so let me know your thoughts this is my

321
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,079
email address and I'd like to take

322
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,170
comments questions thoughts right now if

323
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,649
you have any

324
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,250
right so yeah okay so the question was

325
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,190
why a mix of offline and online

326
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,180
communities I think the advantage of our

327
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,180
own communities can be well you have

328
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,710
stronger bonds it's easier to coordinate

329
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,660
and it's also easier if you're going to

330
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,350
be conducting user interviews then

331
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,880
ideally you have two people at user

332
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,650
interviews once to take notes one to ask

333
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,530
questions so that each person can focus

334
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,930
a bit and the person taking notes can

335
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,820
fill in if the other person doesn't know

336
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,340
what to ask and that's always easier to

337
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:47,990
coordinate locally oh yeah I think I

338
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,000
think online only has some certain

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,140
advantages of its own it's easier to

340
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,330
find volunteers the for volunteers tend

341
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,280
to be more motivated because they're you

342
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,630
know they're coming online they may be

343
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,610
associated with the software itself so

344
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,959
there are definite advantages to doing

345
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,910
it online as well and you can still be

346
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,880
local interviews but generally alone so

347
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,390
yeah Prague this was in Prague Czech

348
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:26,530
Republic yeah

349
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,510
so the frequency it was partly based on

350
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,370
the first meetings that I had you know

351
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,060
how frequently others felt like they

352
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,200
they could devote time to this and it

353
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
was also partly based on my schedule

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,070
because I'm working I have school so I

355
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,690
needed to coordinated these things and

356
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,480
it turned out to be you know the idea

357
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,450
was to have it once a week but then

358
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,730
sometimes it fell through because some

359
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,590
people couldn't go I sometimes couldn't

360
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,040
go so that that's how we decided

361
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:40,570
right so so the question is with lean UX

362
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,850
if there's a danger of just

363
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,220
incorporating the stuff from the polar

364
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,790
personas or just you know the protocol

365
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,500
as being very much like influencing the

366
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,680
course of the research and I agree with

367
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,510
you that's that's actually why I didn't

368
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,460
do lean UX at first because that's

369
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,430
something that I that does concern me if

370
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,520
you do research afterwards and start

371
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,350
with Berto personas you're more likely

372
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,170
to your final personas are more likely

373
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,410
to be like the original protocol s that

374
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,020
said it does have the advantage of you

375
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,630
being able to start right away on fixing

376
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,090
user experience bugs and not having to

377
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,130
worry about that so this is something

378
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,480
that you need to keep in mind while

379
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,780
doing the research I'm not sure if

380
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,370
there's an easy solution that really

381
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,630
keep them try to be objective when

382
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:42,060
incorporating that research okay

383
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,670
and so the question is what I was

384
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,470
looking for volunteers was I looking for

385
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,920
these people interested in you score or

386
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,400
people interested in UX um good question

387
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,570
I so I just started Meetup and I I was

388
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,210
kind of free balling it so it was more

389
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,130
like you know people who are interested

390
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,290
in open source or user experience design

391
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,970
I tagged this events on meetup calm

392
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,100
using these various tags music as well

393
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,120
and the people that came generally came

394
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
from generally were interested in user

395
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,750
experience design and were an

396
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,730
experienced it and the thing that

397
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,790
motivated them and coming to the meetups

398
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,220
was learning how to do user experience

399
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,060
design I'm not sure if that was because

400
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,250
of the description of the of the

401
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,990
projects if you know people interested

402
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,640
in music didn't feel like they could get

403
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,000
involved I'm not sure but it attracted

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,840
the user experience newbie crowd any

405
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,800
other thoughts comments questions any

406
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,490
recommendations on how to do a user

407
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,860
centered design or any knowledge about

408
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,200
other projects that have incorporated

409
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,690
this in a volunteer-based way

410
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,460
I'll just repeat that so the tip was to

411
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,710
keep everything you keep everything

412
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,190
documented to have the personas and the

413
00:21:34,190 --> 00:22:03,320
user research findings on the wiki so so

414
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,690
the tip was that to make videos as well

415
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,120
because for some people more easy to

416
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:45,200
digest they wouldn't like the person is

417
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,429
right but they're like oh the use

418
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,450
yeah so just to repeat that the comment

419
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,570
was that if he and and yes and call

420
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,809
we're debating whether personas make

421
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,909
sense how useful they are and especially

422
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,889
poor do personas if they're useful at

423
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:17,860
all but at the same time we refer to

424
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,129
persona we never we're doing design even

425
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:23,350
with if we don't have for someone as we

426
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,029
keep using the word the user you know

427
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,769
these are would like this user would

428
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:28,870
like something so you know heads there

429
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,240
is a persona we just don't actually put

430
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,690
it down and I agree with that and I

431
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,940
think I think they're Sooners are useful

432
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,600
I think they get a bad rap because after

433
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,850
them is what you see our proto personas

434
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,070
that don't really have any bag that

435
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,970
aren't backed by research so it's yeah

436
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,940
so so you could have elastic the elastic

437
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,730
user problem so because you you don't

438
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,370
really have a person to actually work

439
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,580
from

440
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:08,079
