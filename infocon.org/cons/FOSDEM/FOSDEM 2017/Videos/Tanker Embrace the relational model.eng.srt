1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,320
hi everyone so it's nearly time to start

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,310
it's time to start so I'm gonna talk

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,890
about Tonka and if you don't want to

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,539
listen to me and follow it you're all

6
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,210
real with him again but with the

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,530
presentation at this so a bit of

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,280
presentation I'm first everybody give me

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,989
correctly it's all right or should I

10
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,190
speak louder like that so I do Python

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,460
development since 2006 and if you also

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,110
SQL what the f see that mean stuff

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,260
general development I'm also a long time

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,680
Triton contributor so it's a new

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,960
framework in Python and I spend so much

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,140
time on it that I probably skew it and

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,109
how I see development and oh database

18
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,920
with works and etc and currently I'm an

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
admin employee many consistent for

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,020
energy which is an energy provider in

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,749
both France and Belgium Italy and Aquino

22
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,520
is hiring so we are searching for Python

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,429
developers so if you look for a job you

24
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,130
can ask us so I will start with a bit of

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,840
context about Tonka off to give a an

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,780
idea of why it was created and then I

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,780
will show some example or it works and

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,590
and tells some details about how it

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,139
works and how to use it

30
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,649
and then a few slides about the future

31
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,289
thank you so many what I still don't

32
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,850
like about it what I would like to

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,709
implement and

34
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,129
somebody's so as I said we are

35
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,379
consisting mainly Ferengi and we work

36
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:23,799
with a lot of external data so it's we

37
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,129
are loading data from web services well

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,349
Dominic CSV on the web or we are

39
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,420
scrapping websites or FTP files like

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,640
that those data are most of the time if

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,510
you need nominal alized so completely

42
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,950
the opposite of what you want in a

43
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,910
database we have most of the time nodes

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,379
this tidy to identify the record so we

45
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,750
don't know if it's the first time we see

46
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,180
the value or if it's an update of

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,959
existing value and sometimes with an ID

48
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,430
but it can be unreliable or sometimes

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,319
you don't even know what can be opposite

50
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,639
isin I listened as I said we are

51
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,489
scrapings website and she's really

52
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,870
strong and when it's not external data

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,989
what is data inside the company

54
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,519
everybody loves work with Excel or

55
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,459
everybody at least developers and it's

56
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,139
the same issues we don't have any is

57
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:42,040
work with Excel we could add some it

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,470
creates other issues and generally we

59
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,389
have no metadata for that and more about

60
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,260
the context so this is more about all we

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,109
get the data and what we do with those

62
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,380
data we have a few amount of business

63
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,359
data or concept as

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,290
if not much data with a lot of logic

65
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,440
about it and so as I said we have we for

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,410
example we manage that about powerplant

67
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,040
fuels shipments and we maintain a lot of

68
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,350
time series so like weather forecast

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,910
plant prediction and stuff like that so

70
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,310
it's mainly time series we don't care

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,690
about one line alone we care about a lot

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,050
of data to compute averages some and

73
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,400
stuff like that so we are far away from

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,810
here your blog application also fragment

75
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,800
so the first question would be you we

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,470
have the other m's in Python so we could

77
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,530
use them to to write this data in

78
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,889
databases but as I said we work with a

79
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,810
lot of time series and stuff like that

80
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,630
so we don't need to instantiate an

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,750
object for each time stamp it's not

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,919
really useful but we need other type of

83
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,940
features then what solution offers and I

84
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,860
like and you should like the relational

85
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,039
model and you don't always need object

86
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,250
in Python you can work with kind of

87
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,289
relation and it also in pattern

88
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,180
so as I said we have no idea student

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,889
file cards but we've when you read all

90
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,219
those e cards you can identify them when

91
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,479
you have a weather forecast we have a

92
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,969
time stamp region where this was the

93
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,819
focus is done and temperature so there

94
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,279
is a way to identify stuff is a way to

95
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,919
know if they type new world or if it's

96
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,289
an update or not so all release is a

97
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,479
technical support do that so the idea is

98
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,469
okay let's enforce this way of working

99
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,039
let's work with natural key for our

100
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,909
business key for everything and let's

101
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:37,619
build on that so I start with the I will

102
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,749
do the main example with the same set of

103
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,430
data so let's say we have incoming data

104
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,110
looking like that like that can be a CSV

105
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,159
file or coming from an excel file so as

106
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,800
you can see we have different people

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,469
that are member of different team in

108
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,019
different countries and it shows them as

109
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,769
a code which can act like butter France

110
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,629
or something like that yeah it is so

111
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,399
it's a bit tricky because as you can see

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,399
we have different team with the same

113
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,319
name in different countries so we'll see

114
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,629
how it works

115
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:25,529
with that so in tanker owed you define

116
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,330
your table in the example I show it with

117
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,369
our definition but it could work with a

118
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:38,999
simple Python dictionary so I hope you

119
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,279
know all Yammer works but if not if not

120
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,449
is that difficult so this will become a

121
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,699
list in Python so ever list and each

122
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,699
piece is a dictionary and it is really

123
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,949
defined

124
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,310
the table we want to define the color of

125
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,879
the table and an index so are we don't

126
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,840
define something in this table and so

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,169
here is this mean we're going to create

128
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,439
a table called team with the name a

129
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,129
country which reference config : which

130
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,199
has a hundred country table and that

131
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,449
will use the ID column of the country

132
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:26,509
table so it's a foreign key table

133
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,240
country it's even simpler we only have a

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,279
name : and of course we index on that

135
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,059
and so all we have to do is define the

136
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,380
member table which contain the name of

137
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,589
member the code of the member and to

138
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,339
which this member is linked and it in

139
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,140
this situation we use the code itself as

140
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,050
music

141
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,110
so now we have defined a loop of the

142
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,949
database all we have to do is to say

143
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:08,600
which database we want to connect to so

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,910
it can be searched like phosphorus the

145
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,000
balls back in supported by tan color and

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,140
so here it's dictionary saying which you

147
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,750
are hi we want to connect to for the

148
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,660
database and then Tsushima so we only

149
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,310
this time and F is the Yama we saw and

150
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,209
then with that we can use the connect

151
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,709
method which is context manager and with

152
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,290
that we can set the table the table

153
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,459
definition of also config and if the

154
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,390
table does not exist is that if if a

155
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,779
table doesn't exist which related and

156
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,699
then we add the current and something

157
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,000
that can be tricky sometimes

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,520
you don't have to specify your table in

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,720
the specific order

160
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,790
in the example I quit first in that

161
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,990
reference quantity in the example I

162
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,150
defined first the team table that was

163
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,370
around the country table well it's not

164
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,530
an issue and but there is no support for

165
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,630
migration so if you change the type of a

166
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,730
colon it won't work but if you add a

167
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,890
colon and rerun the creative any keyword

168
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,530
so how do we put content in the database

169
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,530
knowest anchor so we I chose the

170
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,020
countries here as a simple list of table

171
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,750
so it's your job to extract this

172
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,280
information from your source and then

173
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,510
what we do is we instantiate view object

174
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,640
so the first argument of the be object

175
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,250
is the table we want to write to and the

176
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,960
second one is the list of column we want

177
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,380
to fill so in this case conscience is

178
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,280
his name is Johnny : so once view is

179
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,000
created we call right and it's gonna

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,339
write the country for us and fill the

181
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:24,310
name column so quite easy same for teams

182
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,540
so it's really close we create a view

183
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,330
for the tin table and we say we gonna

184
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,860
map two columns now the name column and

185
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,070
then the country : the country as I told

186
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,270
you is a foreign key and here we say we

187
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,610
don't use the name : of the country to

188
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,630
identify our our accountant so Tumkur

189
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,120
knows okay this train is gonna be the

190
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,680
name of a country and I will maintain

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,260
the foreign key in the team table for

192
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,490
you and so then we can write it like

193
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,370
that yeah I didn't explain it so the

194
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,150
view objects

195
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,190
close to the only objects you will need

196
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,020
in tanker you can see it as when you

197
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,370
read that a fourth at the base you can

198
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,360
see it as a view like a view to burn in

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,029
the database because you can use it to

200
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,790
select which Quran you want to see but

201
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,990
here we also use it to to write and so

202
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,730
it's all you view database and all

203
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,000
you're gonna write in the database so

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,140
after those to step out done we can saw

205
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,089
in this case with SQLite we can use a

206
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,680
scale active online to check what we

207
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,810
have done so we see we work at our

208
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,570
countries the IT colon was created for

209
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:02,500
us with a note on command same for the

210
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,089
team and then this is wrong

211
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,310
copy passed and the foreign key here is

212
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,490
filled by the correct countries so as

213
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,850
you can see we have two blue team in two

214
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,430
different countries but our index is

215
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,839
built on those two columns so it's not

216
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:30,700
an issue so oh it works exactly because

217
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,010
as I said the goal is also to to batch a

218
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,970
lot of write in one go so in this case I

219
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,690
have three countries and from and three

220
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,660
teams so it's not a big deal but the

221
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,240
goal is to write thousands of values in

222
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,400
one go and the first implementation was

223
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,380
trying to write the base line by line

224
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,420
and it was super slow so so it works oh

225
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,660
it works so when you call right the

226
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,250
first thing we do is to create a

227
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,459
temporary table and this top of a table

228
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,860
has no constraint so it's there is

229
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,520
nothing to to check women right on that

230
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,980
it's really

231
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,779
temporary place to put stuff so we call

232
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,540
copy form so compromise from the post

233
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,110
less API

234
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,010
it allows you to kind of upload a CSV

235
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,720
into progress in one go and it's the

236
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
fastest way to put stuff in process in

237
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,459
SQLite you can still write stuff like

238
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,089
byline because you have no pay you have

239
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:41,790
no costs to pay across the network and

240
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,769
you are the same process so it's fast

241
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,560
so once this table table is filled we

242
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,690
join this double dipper with the actual

243
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,180
one so let's say we want to fill teams I

244
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,719
don't know what happens

245
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,630
so this join with tellers which line of

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,750
the time perfect type table is new and

247
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,790
which one which line already exists in

248
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,630
the Rift happens

249
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,800
Rita burners and so we insert a new line

250
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,959
and we update blindly all the other one

251
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,399
so so when you upload when you write we

252
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,720
need to write with something like that

253
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,000
you overwrite everything or at least all

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,180
the line we don't try to say oh this

255
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,310
line is completely equal so we don't

256
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,230
touch it now we insert and update

257
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,720
everything and then when this is done

258
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,089
with optimal table and we are done

259
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:48,660
so it's it's a nice way to to to do the

260
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,480
right in in the batch with the temporary

261
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,620
table but still maintain all the feature

262
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,079
like foreign key resolution so when you

263
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,350
write when you do a reference super job

264
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,760
of course we know which side it is

265
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,620
insulated should I do something to stop

266
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,670
that

267
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:18,890
I closed it

268
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:49,370
or of course sometime we have stuff in

269
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,470
the database so we can read it so yes so

270
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,270
still with the connect context ledger so

271
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,910
as you can see it's AG is the same view

272
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,209
definition so it's it there but it could

273
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,010
be the same object if you want to keep

274
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,089
the same object but sorry well you say

275
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,339
we want name colon and the country

276
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,740
current but you give me the name of the

277
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,930
country and not right I don't care about

278
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,150
it

279
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,180
and so the dot feed give us

280
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,520
so does execute the query and give us

281
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,709
back is possible scripts or vasculitis

282
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,980
oh so you can loop on that or you can do

283
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,210
dot all and all we instantiate the list

284
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,940
for you and you are supposed to get back

285
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,770
what you put on that so a more

286
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,700
complicated example now so we have put

287
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,160
the team and the countries in the

288
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,780
database and now we got to put the

289
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,360
members and if you know pond on the

290
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,330
defame tonker also support it so the

291
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,160
example before it was with the list of

292
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,110
tips but it can be also that a friend

293
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,730
that also content so here we have all

294
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,060
our members their country code and teams

295
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,200
and so to write them what we give now so

296
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
we have to say to tanker so before that

297
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,590
we were giving list so the position of

298
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,810
the name of the quran' was left so when

299
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,379
we did that

300
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,030
when we did that it was implicit that

301
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,920
the first argument is the name and the

302
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,330
second one is a country so it's a

303
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,830
position that gives you what is what

304
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,500
here what we give is a dictionary and

305
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,020
when you give a dictionary we the tanker

306
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,820
we will get the name here from the

307
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,440
defame consumers our own etc you can

308
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,590
also give a list of dictionary instead

309
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,210
of at the frame and it'll work the same

310
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,110
so in this case we say ok name is going

311
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,410
to be the name of our members the

312
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,120
country here is the name of the controls

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,550
the team of the members so tanker will

314
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,050
have to join all those thing to know

315
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,600
which team in which country is linked to

316
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,670
and then the team itself so for the

317
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,320
first example we have we're gonna have

318
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,890
we're gonna have Bob in blue team in

319
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,570
Belgium and in this case it's a tricky

320
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,650
run because as you remember we have to

321
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,910
know we have to hear tankers to say ok

322
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,130
this member is in this team but it's not

323
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,960
enough to say is the blue team or the

324
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,580
red team because we have several blue

325
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,820
team in different countries and we have

326
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,400
the index on the team which is on both

327
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,820
on the name and the country itself so we

328
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,590
have to give those two information for

329
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,440
tanker to know which team exactly this

330
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,650
and discovers right ID for the race you

331
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,290
have to give the country so it's a

332
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,360
couple of the team name and the country

333
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,400
name that gives the team exactly but

334
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,650
beside that it's gonna work it's not

335
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,750
more complicated so once it's written

336
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,710
you can read back the result just before

337
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,260
I show you how to read a list you can

338
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,200
also after it cold yes

339
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,460
and this would give you or that that

340
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,750
came back and so we give we get back I

341
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:07,160
thought that famous also result and now

342
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,270
if you check the database we see that it

343
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,060
was I think Bob and hoodie so those two

344
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,950
are in blue team but the first one is

345
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,710
the Belgian team and the other one is a

346
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:25,270
whole team so it's a nice twelve

347
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,020
so when you read stuff from database you

348
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,000
can read the refinish one but most of

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,130
the time you want to filter stuff and

350
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,190
all the filter works are based on s

351
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,590
expression so if you know this you

352
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,020
already know that the SF expression is

353
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,550
symbolic discussion only does the main

354
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,620
advantage of an expression basic fashion

355
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,040
is that it's supposed to pass so it's

356
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,000
super easy to have a small language to

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,200
express the filters so in this case we

358
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,460
want on the team we want only members

359
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,320
whose team in country Belgium

360
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,810
so we say we want to read the member

361
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:20,380
table and we want the country of the

362
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,420
member and these filters to continuously

363
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,230
Belgium so the first time German of

364
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,130
weight is a filter and when we read back

365
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:52,210
from the we have yeah it should be it

366
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,220
should be team that name here because we

367
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,470
have team as result and not countries

368
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,050
but anyway this is how it work

369
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,110
yeah in the back so if you do this call

370
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,540
tanker will generate that for you

371
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,790
so if basically each time you do a dot

372
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,190
you will have to you will generate a

373
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,860
joint in your supercar yeah as I said

374
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,880
you are weak so select the name of the

375
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,170
team for member and then we join on team

376
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,410
and then we join our country and then we

377
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,860
said the country name should be should

378
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,650
be Benjamin so it's quite easy and you

379
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,380
can hear it's a small example with

380
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,990
retailers so this is the most complete

381
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,420
joint we can do but we have position

382
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,250
somewhere with 60 tables and sometimes

383
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,870
the query eats then joins together and

384
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,310
take care we try to reuse some joins if

385
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,790
possible

386
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,050
and will avoid to do stupid stuff if you

387
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,620
have a diamond crevice so if you have

388
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,510
several joints that goes through the

389
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,440
same table but two different paths

390
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,020
anyway so if you want more complete

391
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,490
cranny so we here we have also a nice

392
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,170
expression so I I forgot to give some

393
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:31,560
tests

394
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,780
it's quite easy all lift to know is that

395
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,300
it's an operator left operand and right

396
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,230
so it's like teen name equal blue and so

397
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,890
here we want blue team or member code in

398
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:53,580
zero two and we have the member with

399
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:01,650
those those members yes so blue team are

400
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,120
those two and zero run a.22 anyway and

401
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,750
here of the current operator so I show

402
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,410
an equal in but you have not acquired

403
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,090
bigger smaller that is not new not new

404
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:23,100
right Angie it's in fact I I'm not sure

405
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,670
I have everything but until now I

406
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,170
haven't yet needed some field so this is

407
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,690
quite easy until now but the big problem

408
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,240
when you work with external data is that

409
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,650
you have also to updated you have to

410
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,970
maintain them so this is all new the

411
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,040
authority we have scrapped a website or

412
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,090
downloaded something so Trudy has

413
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,050
disappeared and then is now in her team

414
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:58,020
in Belgium it was in Holland and the

415
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,720
code is small is the same so you have

416
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,210
the same you that define all you map

417
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,450
this data to database you write members

418
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,990
but the new version of members and by

419
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,850
default right will only try to insert an

420
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,010
update but won't try to delete

421
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:25,270
so purge here you said doctor okay if a

422
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,910
line is missing the visitors room so in

423
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,929
our example hoody is missing so the

424
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,640
purge argument will say removed hoodie

425
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,360
from Italy if not only time is submitted

426
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,150
but you can also say in certain updated

427
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,190
argument somebody for that but you can

428
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,410
say insert legal force so I will write

429
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,960
the title my database but III want on

430
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,610
either place and you don't answer to

431
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,040
stuff okay and then when we read back

432
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,059
stuff who disappeared and now Dan is in

433
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,760
the head Belgium so quickly other

434
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,169
features that I don't cover it I haven't

435
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:13,870
covered so ACL access control list you

436
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,390
can define filters that are

437
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,490
automatically enforced for you all the

438
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:23,020
time it's mainly and if you have multi

439
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,110
user application and you want to say

440
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,140
this user can update this table or this

441
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,140
line in those table but not in

442
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,460
connection pooling so you can create a

443
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,820
lot of connection but tell government in

444
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,200
the pool so you don't overload the

445
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,130
database you can work with bility thread

446
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,330
and nested context so if you want to

447
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,549
connect with two databases and confer

448
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,650
that data from one to the other is going

449
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,460
to work this is not a feature but the

450
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,190
limitation because we use the public

451
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,110
table SQLite as soon as you create a

452
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:06,910
table even a temporary one kit commit

453
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,410
for you

454
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,669
so when you work this tonight you're

455
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:12,630
gonna have transaction as soon as you

456
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,100
you start to write if you do one right

457
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,360
it's not a big issue but if you do

458
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,960
several write a few writing can be

459
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,910
committed for you and then you wonder

460
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,360
what's happening yes their support for

461
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,750
more which way to pass argument you can

462
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,030
also eat the food value in your database

463
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,250
so you can have a timestamp with a

464
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,380
default value while now and it's genuine

465
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,020
source terminal and there is an explicit

466
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:46,260
delete method on you and short code map

467
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,130
so currently 320 resolution is done in

468
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,490
Python so before writing we have to

469
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,920
resolve foreign in Python so we have to

470
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,370
know Belgium is ID one phosphate so it

471
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,420
can be an issue with bit yeah this is

472
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,240
difficult to explain now Postgres

473
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,230
support absurd so we may use I think

474
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,840
there is a way to use it and avoid the

475
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,290
pollen table I think so the position is

476
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,179
insert and on config update which is

477
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:31,559
quite maybe I could add more type of :

478
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,330
so currently we can create current of

479
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,510
Varsha type step and also the one we may

480
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,640
need more

481
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,710
there is no way to detect conflict so if

482
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,710
you read a bunch of that from database

483
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,910
somebody update them meanwhile and then

484
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,830
you want to write back you're gonna

485
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,678
erase everything I did or you don't know

486
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:03,410
ever more so currently we insert update

487
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,500
always it if something is missing we may

488
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,380
need to I already see some application

489
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,660
to to trigger something else in addition

490
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,700
when record is a plane yeah and a filter

491
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,910
when we write so if you have a filter

492
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,010
when you write first you know you gonna

493
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,620
you want to write something you don't

494
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,980
expect to write but you want also delete

495
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,420
something you don't want to delete yeah

496
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,080
and that's all and I give some link so I

497
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,820
use their SD to PDF for supplementation

498
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,150
it's another one with a good one it's a

499
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,910
nice library and some links about stuff

500
00:30:43,910 --> 00:31:05,150
I don't follow any question no currently

501
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,440
there is no way to to to to to to load

502
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,590
its information from an existing but it

503
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,260
could be done because I already do them

504
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,120
because I have to know when I create the

505
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,830
: I have to know if it's already there

506
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,540
if you can't read so most of the code is

507
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,790
there to do that but I haven't gotten it

508
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,430
yet yes

509
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,619
yeah

510
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,390
[Applause]
