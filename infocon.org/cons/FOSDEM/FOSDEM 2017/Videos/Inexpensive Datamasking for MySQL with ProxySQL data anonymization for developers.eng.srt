1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,750
they had the pleasure to present to

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,660
co-present with Rene so you have seen

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,030
all his work today and for people that

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,240
was here yesterday on proxy SQL so is

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,279
the founder the main developer and the

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,619
one like if you saw Coleen slide that

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,900
spent all his night developing it's him

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
so you can say thank you for for all his

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,349
work yeah and I am the one that may wake

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,890
him up during the night to fix stuff but

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,590
so it's a shared work first I want to

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,320
ask you guys who knows what but I'm

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,050
asking is not much so from the guy who

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,339
knows it who needs the time asking some

15
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:56,039
of them okay so first and say that this

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,620
is the most fun part of the of the

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,449
presentation the most interesting one No

18
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,329
so everything I say here is just you

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,270
know yeah it's for example you can test

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,640
it don't try to go to prediction with

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,259
what I said that's all but Fred says

22
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:13,110
it's like that yeah it is for you need

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,229
to test if you want that be sure of it

24
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,420
this is just let's say I want to show

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,490
you something about proxy SQL everything

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,409
that guy says it's written in stone so

27
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,619
you have to to follow him and this is so

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,210
this safe our bar is only for me not for

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,759
him so let's start by who we are so

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,950
she's Renee I will let him introduce

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,079
himself hi

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,140
so you can follow me on Twitter and is

33
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,350
the proxy SQL founder right and you also

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,550
work at Dropbox so this is me you can

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,050
follow me on Twitter for people who

36
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,060
likes Twitter sorry and so I'm managing

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,220
my skype for a long time and I'm DevOps

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,140
the believer but nothing to do with that

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,240
today so no worries if you don't like

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,259
DevOps so first let's talk about what is

41
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,460
proxy SQL so this is the mask ul data

42
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,990
Stargate that's it this is all you need

43
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,910
to know if you need to know a bit more

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,360
of details yeah so basically I mean it

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
was already introduced in the previous

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,350
session so for who was not here the idea

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,640
is that the proxy has to be a middle

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,980
layer between the application and the PI

49
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,000
server so my vision is really it's a

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,220
gate that communicators those two layers

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,620
and the wise thing in the middle between

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,300
those two layers is able to do a lot of

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,350
things like query routing the processing

54
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,570
of the query like blocking them or

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,100
forwarding somewhere else

56
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,380
rewriting them caching and of course the

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,420
session this session is about data

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,070
masking so again this is one of the

59
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,170
option that you can do having a middle

60
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,030
layer in the middle Thank You Ronnie so

61
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,950
yes this session is not about everything

62
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,930
in proxy SQL you saw the previous

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,540
session it's more about like the queries

64
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,190
rewriting that we're gonna do so why do

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,260
would like to use proxies well as the

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,510
term asking solution because it's open

67
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,670
source and free like in beer so who

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,489
knows other solution for MySQL to do

69
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,530
data masking nobody Sveta

70
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,670
[Music]

71
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,040
yeah you can find someone Google like

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,130
greensql for example but this is quite

73
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,470
costly right they are dark they are

74
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,450
quite expensive so it depends for what

75
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,610
you need but let's first talk about data

76
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,390
masking I didn't think about making a

77
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,020
slide on that but the what do we want to

78
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,459
let's say to resolve with this data

79
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,290
masking what's the problem the problem

80
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,050
is that sometime you have developers and

81
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,300
your production data and the proper one

82
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,550
needs a copy or just they need to access

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,470
in read-only the data the pollution data

84
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,080
but maybe your data is sensitive you

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,610
have sensitive information there that

86
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,850
you don't want that any developers in

87
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,820
your in your let's say enterprise have

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,649
access maybe of students that works

89
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,720
there or whatever and so you say ok

90
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,480
maybe we have data that we need to mask

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,340
so the data should be there the

92
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,350
performance to see ok you need to

93
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,300
retrieve you need to sort or whatever

94
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,550
but it should be mask you should not see

95
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,130
it right so this is just about that I

96
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,560
will talk about that also later but

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,630
currently there is no there is no very

98
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,150
good solution on the time asking right

99
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,650
now so this is one option that we did so

100
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,660
the other solution are very expensive or

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,700
they are just not working or not working

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,650
properly and for the price some time is

103
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,460
not that good this one is not worse than

104
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,479
the other solutions but because they are

105
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,390
none are perfect so if you have seen a

106
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,370
bit of a jar if you want to discuss

107
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,760
about jewelry yes I talked previously is

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,080
the street expert in MySQL yeah

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,350
it's always possible to extort ooh to

110
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,600
deal with security so watch out

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,660
so the best solution if you really want

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,090
to have data masking it would be to

113
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,150
integrate this inside of the server for

114
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,510
example just after the N layer API so

115
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,000
when you get the storage engine gets the

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,460
data that you modify the data there

117
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,950
before exposing it to the client

118
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,100
but yeah this is I think this is a lot

119
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,060
of work and currently it's not in our

120
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,070
roadmap to do so maybe in the future so

121
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,740
what is the concept of data masking

122
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,130
using proxy SQL so what we gonna do is

123
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,900
that we're gonna use regular expression

124
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm very sorry about that because I will

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,870
show you the regular expression after we

126
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,030
are very let's say we are all in the IT

127
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,610
world so we are using Perl regular

128
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,690
expression so sorry for people who ate

129
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,100
that but you will see they are very easy

130
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,050
so what we want to do is we get the data

131
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,030
and before we send the data to the

132
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,940
client we want to modify it so we want

133
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,010
to say oh we have some rules and for

134
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,800
example an easy one we don't want that

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,200
the developer or this user cannot see

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,990
the credit card numbers make sense that

137
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,870
you don't want to share your your credit

138
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,330
card numbers or something like that yes

139
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,890
yeah this is just know my example is not

140
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,590
it's just with critical numbers so I

141
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,230
know you're not like I said you remember

142
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,020
what I said it's just for example and

143
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,420
the numbers you will see are not real so

144
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,140
don't try them so what I mean any data

145
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,300
you want emails or whatever you don't

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,070
you if you have some data that you don't

147
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,050
want to share with the developer you

148
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,970
need to add it so in this case when the

149
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,310
developer will do a select we need to

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,120
find all this the column we need to ID

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,790
and we need to add it and then return it

152
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,010
so this is what we're going to do in

153
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,219
fact

154
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,889
so first how do we do that so in proxy

155
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,649
SQL we need to create a user so it has

156
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,679
so managing proxy SQL maybe it was not

157
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,649
abused or it was too fast or you are not

158
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,259
in the previous sessions about proxy SQL

159
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,259
but the administered min interface is

160
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,129
just SQL almost standard SQL with some

161
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,099
keywords just specific for proxy SQL of

162
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,649
course but it's very easy so if you want

163
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,689
to create a user you gotta do insert

164
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,229
into MySQL user and give a user and a

165
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,149
password so in this case we create a

166
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,759
username called devil first thing we

167
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,159
need to do like I told you earlier we

168
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,759
want to hide this column right the non

169
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,169
credit card column we want to add it and

170
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,099
so so what you're going to do is to

171
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,439
check for this column but people can do

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,869
select star right so we want to avoid

173
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:32,469
that too

174
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,899
so if the developer do select star we

175
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,149
need to avoid say select star you cannot

176
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,039
do it on this table right so we need to

177
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,250
create some rules to stop this and all

178
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,529
variant of select star so if the table

179
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,629
is part of many tables we need to do the

180
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,509
same so hide this name for every table

181
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,000
this is how it works but it is also

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
constrained currently so it will so

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,199
let's say you want to I to an email in a

184
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,300
you know user table but you want to

185
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,579
either knee mail same column name in

186
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,240
another table here in this case it won't

187
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
work they will both be hidden this is

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,569
one of the limitation we have so the

189
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,579
second rule we need to mask the field

190
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,529
right

191
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,110
so when the field is selected we will

192
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,910
need just replace in my example what I

193
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,949
will do is I will show the column and I

194
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,509
will just show the first two characters

195
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:40,329
or numbers or whatever you want just to

196
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,230
and then put X's right to to mask but at

197
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,220
least why I play this

198
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,960
two characters it's in case you want to

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,230
sort in your exam in your query or

200
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,420
whatever so you can do it you want also

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,780
to keep the column name because if you

202
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,280
do okay select email and then you do a

203
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,280
lot of changes there you want that in

204
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,800
the result will still have email so

205
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
because what we do we rewrite the query

206
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,500
so we will send a query to MySQL and the

207
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,560
query we sent it's about changing

208
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,600
already when we send it to ask you to -

209
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,120
MySQL so we need but we need to return

210
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,500
the the name so an example this number

211
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,920
will become like this so if we want to

212
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,030
mask this system from the table customer

213
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,069
we will need seven rules

214
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,750
so this is the rule number one so as you

215
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,959
can see yeah you see a very nice mouse

216
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,910
pointer so as you can see ya

217
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,980
the first one it's quite easy to

218
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,540
understand we're looking for this CCM

219
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,329
right and if we have it we will replace

220
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,889
it so this is not complicated but we

221
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,199
need to find because people and I will

222
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,500
discuss that after they put some quotes

223
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,139
they put some parentheses they will do

224
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,699
everything is possible to get that

225
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,360
information so we need to to try to

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
focus on all that then it becomes a bit

227
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,000
more complicated so like I told you I

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,839
like Perl so this is also we will try to

229
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,199
find characters to find our what we are

230
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,300
looking for and then we will make a cone

231
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,209
cut in fact so what we gonna send to my

232
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,240
square is just okay we don't tell it

233
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,490
give me the system just give me the two

234
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,240
first characters of CC nom plus

235
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,860
concatenating with with the X we want

236
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,640
okay so we don't send the the full

237
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,040
request to my square so this is a

238
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,300
rewrite of the query in fact

239
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,020
yes that's basically us this is a

240
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,760
completely rewrite of the query one of

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,230
the important thing to notice if you're

242
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,760
familiar with regular expression of

243
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,410
course this you have those that are

244
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,390
nothing more than reference to the

245
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,700
matching pattern so this refers to this

246
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,250
one this one to the other one and so on

247
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,220
so you can and the thing this is not

248
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,370
possible with the my sequel like a

249
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,990
fright plugin doing back reference and

250
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,640
you cannot do that also with regular

251
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,709
expression you need the power regular

252
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,240
expression because we have also case

253
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,610
less and global here so we want to do it

254
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,690
every time

255
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,740
it happened so this is so if you are you

256
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,420
familiar with proxy scale maybe you have

257
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,910
never seen this and this is because I

258
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,540
asked Rene to do that and it will be

259
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,709
really soon right so yeah you can

260
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,180
compile the code but there is no

261
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,420
packages with this information yet so

262
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,970
then we have extra rules again but I

263
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,630
won't detail them all as you can see

264
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,140
there it's fun so also what we're gonna

265
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,510
do here is that if somebody do a select

266
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,040
everything from the customer who just

267
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,899
gonna send to the to the user sending

268
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,230
the query that is not allowed to get

269
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,760
that information you can put everything

270
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,850
you want there of course but so this is

271
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,410
the message every time somebody will go

272
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,959
the developer that user will do a select

273
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,000
star for example in this case will

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,399
receive okay you're not allowed to do

275
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,160
that so we return an error

276
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,009
again same information because you need

277
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,860
to take care of several different cases

278
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,699
that I will show so what are the

279
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,220
limitation the limitation is this this

280
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,699
is supported only with proxy SQL big or

281
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,779
equal of 1.4 not the previous version

282
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,779
right so all filled in the same of the

283
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,339
same name this is what I was saying

284
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,220
before will be masked even if you say ok

285
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,170
this is for this table we don't check

286
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,120
about table in this case because maybe

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,829
you can join several table then it will

288
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:28,529
be very complicated if you find a very

289
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,230
nice regular expression to do it feel

290
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,089
free to send it to me I will be very

291
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,790
very happy but currently so all the

292
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,199
fields with this name will be mask and

293
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,589
however is the name of the table so of

294
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,790
course regular expression are not let's

295
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,300
always save and maybe the seven words I

296
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,850
give you here are not enough maybe

297
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,829
somebody will come with a fancy solution

298
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,610
I hope so

299
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,730
so we can improve it but I saw already

300
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,680
what we did until now so yeah if you

301
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,269
want to create this all these rules is

302
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,730
quite painful or I think it's painful I

303
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,649
need to remember them so I made it just

304
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,009
more bash script that you call it like

305
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,449
that so you give the column name you

306
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,040
want and if there is a table that you

307
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,290
want to avoid select star from it you

308
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,199
just do it like that it creates the the

309
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,480
rules for you so you can add many as

310
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,420
many rules so how does it look like yeah

311
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,259
so we select star from I will show you

312
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,839
afterlife if we have time but select

313
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,449
star from customer it was easy what

314
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:40,860
we're going to have here we're gonna

315
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,600
have okay you are not allowed to do that

316
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,899
right select first name last name GCM

317
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,240
from customer also easy what we will

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,649
have will have the first name the last

319
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,709
name and the DC cinema you that will be

320
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,429
will call it masked right then more

321
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,319
difficult and then here I need to tank

322
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,449
estimate here again

323
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:08,160
is away he was he was ear so I made some

324
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,949
blog post and I got some contribution or

325
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,019
by email or by comment to say yeah but

326
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,689
if you do this query what will happen so

327
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:19,129
this query is in two lines right

328
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,899
my first was of course it fell

329
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,019
completely and you had the content so

330
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,169
now this is also by the query you have

331
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,389
seen we take care of that so if the

332
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,169
queries in multiple lines it will work

333
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:37,109
if you make this system twice in the

334
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,919
same this is really okay in my school

335
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,149
right you can do that

336
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,759
my the first rules we did without having

337
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,579
this global did so when proxy square was

338
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,290
only doing the regular expression and

339
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,499
not the per regular expression this one

340
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,179
was hidden but not the other one

341
00:16:54,179 --> 00:17:00,419
so now we take care of that now I forgot

342
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,949
but when we put some with the

343
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:07,470
application name no over sit on it

344
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,240
doesn't see ya if you don't see it

345
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,039
because there are quotes in fact and

346
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,709
this is they are removed by the the

347
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,750
syntax that's highlighter but here you

348
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,069
see it to be two different phone so you

349
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,888
have quote the backwards so backwards

350
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,859
single quote double quote all all that

351
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,289
is is taking care and this one also in

352
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,320
two lines it takes care of it so this

353
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,669
one is some two lines this one is just

354
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,620
because it's too long it is when you

355
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,519
have some function before the field it

356
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,059
works too

357
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,340
again extra example that we the route so

358
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,790
all these with the rule I sent you it

359
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,350
will work you mean you won't have the

360
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,880
data it will be a masked so yeah when

361
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,980
you give us T one for example and here

362
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,040
you add analysis it this is taking in a

363
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,160
consideration if you use system and then

364
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,770
you give an alias of it you want to see

365
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,310
fret and not CC nom or not CC no concat

366
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,000
CC Nam or whatever so it will work

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,580
same when there is not the Hat yeah here

368
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,650
again you have the the quotes that you

369
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,540
don't see but there are some codes on

370
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,680
the on the slides it takes care of it

371
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,050
again here this one a squat it takes

372
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,510
care of it and here with the quotes to

373
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,940
does work to so all these case are taken

374
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,920
in consideration by the seven rules you

375
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,820
have seen extra so yeah this is taking

376
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,470
consideration when you put comments

377
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,780
everything it will work you won't see

378
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,320
the data this also you will take care of

379
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,090
it so it won't work this one will be

380
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,510
blocked

381
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,480
this one will be blocked so all these

382
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,380
cases are handled by the proxy SQL with

383
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,380
the rules so it's quite already let's

384
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,080
say it goes far they'll be not enough

385
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,800
for everybody

386
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,690
I don't know and this is what we would

387
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,510
like to we need you for feedback so do

388
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,250
you have some ideas of queries that

389
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,640
won't work

390
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,850
generate some string

391
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,240
yeah but your prepared statement will be

392
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,960
already

393
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,030
I need to check I need to test to see

394
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,899
what we can do

395
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,250
if you have if you find this too fancy

396
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,460
ID send it to send it to us please and

397
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,800
we're gonna test it I mean this lady of

398
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,640
that I'm asking is also to to not make

399
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,310
exactly strict rules of the the queries

400
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,900
that need to be executed because another

401
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,150
approach is just to block any sort of

402
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,280
query with exception of whatever is

403
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
worth listed but of course it's become

404
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,250
more complicated yes

405
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,220
if you can send us an email we will

406
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,550
write

407
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,689
yep

408
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,550
yes

409
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,520
yes but there is not there

410
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,840
yeah we started the slides we're saying

411
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,450
making this in the database server in

412
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,639
the just after the entire API for

413
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:58,669
example will be the best but this is not

414
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:01,639
the case right now so currently we don't

415
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,850
have

416
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,240
but you need to write that information

417
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
so you need to write that and see so

418
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,790
inter interfere with was the storage

419
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,640
engine sends you and then verify oh this

420
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,170
match what we don't want to see and but

421
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,150
this is quite also a lot of work to add

422
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:33,960
it there for and so yeah yeah it sounds

423
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,940
easier for sure yeah this sounds easier

424
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,180
it's not easier this one is just you

425
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,850
have it you can do it if you need that

426
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,130
now today but you can do it like that

427
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,070
and first maybe make some tests and

428
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,170
parse all the queries your user are

429
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,990
doing and just allow this one block the

430
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,760
other one and mask the one that you know

431
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,180
and but you have it know if you have to

432
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,060
wait for MySQL to implement it I cannot

433
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,580
give you yeah it will be next release so

434
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,650
this is the difference here you have it

435
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,950
it doesn't cost you anything but maybe

436
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:13,400
it's not perfect yes to be

437
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,700
so the question is what is the column

438
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,380
name and the table name is the same yeah

439
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,120
didn't write that you are it's more

440
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,809
crazy than me so I will test it and I

441
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,799
will see but yeah I will test it or you

442
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,280
can test it this is this proxy SQL taken

443
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,549
on github compile it and test it if if

444
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,179
you need it

445
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,440
other questions yes

446
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:05,010
Yeah right the responses so yeah the

447
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,620
question here is why do we don't rewrite

448
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,900
the response we get from my scale

449
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,140
instead of writing the query we sent to

450
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,580
my scale and I will let Rene explain you

451
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,160
actually this was a request I had I

452
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,730
think more than one years ago and to be

453
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,770
able to do this the proxy need to

454
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,230
understand the query and currently does

455
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,640
not understand the query because there

456
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,410
is no parsing so it doesn't understand

457
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,090
what the query represent and what

458
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,400
exactly the query is asking so it

459
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,990
doesn't understand what is a columns put

460
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,120
is a table and so on having if the proxy

461
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,640
will understand this then what will do

462
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,310
is that when the server replies it will

463
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,930
take the results that make the

464
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,090
modifications and to the client it will

465
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,060
be way greater overhead anyway because

466
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,340
right now whatever the server is

467
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,960
responding is because it's already

468
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,690
processed that is responding the proxy

469
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,310
just storing temporarily and then

470
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,500
sending row by row or in patches

471
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,600
depending from from the protocol to the

472
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,670
client so there is no extra processing

473
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,590
doing extra processing will be way more

474
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,129
costly

475
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,169
yes

476
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,679
yes but you can have values so you can

477
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,270
run a select CC CC Nam us whatever block

478
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,030
and so the proxy won't know

479
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,210
here we process it once when we send the

480
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,130
data right so we do it once let's say

481
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,419
you do a select and you have thousand

482
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,230
records or you know thousand hundred

483
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,000
thousand record stuff like that you will

484
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,660
need for each rows modified and this is

485
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,880
too much overhead for francisco in this

486
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,130
way the data never live database server

487
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,950
I don't know if that makes any

488
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,110
difference when it comes to security

489
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,910
constraint but the data would never live

490
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,630
terribly server

491
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,889
super-good

492
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,980
well you have so the question was what

493
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,790
if the same proxies use also for

494
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,780
production traffic and not just for

495
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,930
development so the first thing I can is

496
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,470
go back

497
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,769
so here you see you have the username so

498
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,749
all this transformation apply only to

499
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:59,590
that user that maybe the user used by

500
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,218
the developers

501
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,820
just this

502
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,500
yes I mean the question was about how to

503
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,690
try to afloat the main proxy in case

504
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,000
there is too much processing here and of

505
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,490
course you can always create multiple

506
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,620
layer of proxy so one proxy in sending

507
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,960
traffic to the other and you can for

508
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,050
example decide do the processing in just

509
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,820
one of the proxy while the other one is

510
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,130
just for what in traffic and not be

511
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,620
affected by the time required for the

512
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,470
processing by the way the proxy also

513
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,900
collect metric on how much time spent

514
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,300
processing those rules so it is easy to

515
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,370
identify processing those rules is a

516
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:18,770
time consuming operation or not so thank

517
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,000
you very much and let's call the next

518
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,170
speaker Thank You Ronnie

519
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,359
