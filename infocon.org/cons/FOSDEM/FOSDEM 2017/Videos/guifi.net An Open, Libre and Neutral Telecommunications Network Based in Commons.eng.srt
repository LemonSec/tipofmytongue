related to to giving it and well we give

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,350
a like an overview of what giffy is its

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,348
relationship to to free software that's

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:37,809
an overview okay so this is this

10
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,579
presentation is mainly based on this

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,530
document which is what is if minutes an

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,179
introduction to the definite road by

13
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,579
rosette way oh you can easily very

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,460
easily find it from the on the main gift

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,229
net page so he's to be acknowledged for

16
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,749
that okay so there are many

17
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,999
misunderstandings on what giphy is so I

18
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,879
will start by telling what if e net is

19
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,890
not so it's not an internet provider hmm

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,930
it's not an yeah it's not an ISP so but

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,670
we is the access to the Internet we can

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,730
easy this kind of access this is not a

23
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,210
subscription service but there are many

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,730
companies and organizations that provide

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,090
this service on top of Ethernet it is

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,760
not a second-class network some hobbies

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,040
network it is a it is connected to the

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,000
core infrastructure of the Internet it

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,720
is not just a Wi-Fi network we are using

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,600
more advanced technologies like optical

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,970
fiber right now well from and for for

32
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,270
many years we've been doing this this is

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,190
not a single corporation a single

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,960
corporation of any kind it's not a

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,520
public or private corporation there are

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,500
many corporations many organizations

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,310
that are part of definite or participate

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,530
in it

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,330
this is not something held by a single

40
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,788
single organization as well giving it

41
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,490
itself as a network in this this aspect

42
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,430
has many many owners okay so and it is

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,370
not some kind of very radical movement

44
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,560
trying to change the world make it burn

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,390
no we have we are transformative with

46
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,820
let's say political may say in the in

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,220
the broad sense political movement okay

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,210
but we are not very radical in the same

49
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,470
and we are not a geek only or hobbyist

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,950
only project there are many kinds of

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,050
roles everyone can participate everyone

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,620
can play their role okay we are not some

53
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,590
Wild West place we have very clear rules

54
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,180
that we will introduce you later okay

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,840
and it is not actually a new idea this

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,630
is an application of the of the common

57
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,640
pool resource handling to something that

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,520
is new like computer networks this also

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,040
happens with with free software so it's

60
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,380
just a new a new version of something

61
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:32,640
old very old project of giving it before

62
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,210
I talk about techy stuff let's see a

63
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,690
little bit of context definite started

64
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,600
in a little area in the countryside of

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Spain and Catalonia name it zona there

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
are almost no broadband internet access

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,080
so neighbors started to collaborate and

68
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,250
self provision the their internet access

69
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,260
there they were not geeky geek people

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,140
they are farmers normal people that

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,050
wanted to talk sis that public resource

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,290
I even say it's a common pool resource

73
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,450
like some other resources like

74
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,720
piece of work and such some fundamental

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,910
conditions that it's free so Anakin

76
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,460
anyone can do anything like hosting a

77
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,210
speed net web pages we you are free to

78
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,320
do anything it's open to anyone and so

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,590
you can join and study the network see

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,830
how it works and improve it and it's

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,080
neutral so there is no discrimination on

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,800
the content on or who you are talk to

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,070
the network

84
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,770
it started from using community with

85
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,280
hardware like the light link is below

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,850
LRT in 2008 it become an autonomous

87
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,550
system and join the Cognex internet

88
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,360
exchange in Barcelona where we exchange

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,490
traffic with other ISPs and connect to

90
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:36,460
some top-level providers in 2010 there

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,300
were more than 10,000 others and we

92
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,630
started to deploy optical links and

93
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:56,910
nowadays there are more than nodes and

94
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,000
almost 550 thousand

95
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,520
project during the questions we will

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,550
show you a little video of the growth of

97
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,050
the network here you can see a map a map

98
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,750
of the notes on the network

99
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,420
infrastructure that we are on on we have

100
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,990
a Drupal website where we anyone can

101
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,110
register and post their node

102
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,960
configuration we use open LDAP for

103
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,910
outdated identification both on the

104
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,180
website and the network resources like

105
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,200
internet proxies we use some tools like

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,010
smoke being warm weather map or sto IP

107
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,210
for managing resources related to the

108
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,460
network operation center in the connects

109
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,260
and from for config management of the

110
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,170
network protocols we use built quagga

111
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,340
and be make 6 that's it it's a mesh

112
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,100
routing other algorithm and we do both

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,410
use SNMP as protocol both by cactii and

114
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,130
well some Drupal models that we have

115
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,010
developed to public to polish the usage

116
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,370
information almost all Reuters from

117
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,630
definite runs on general in fin worse

118
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,760
although there are a lot of closet

119
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,030
source systems that we are trying to

120
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,550
change but it's it's what users use

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,199
mainly from necrotic and death platforms

122
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,529
and we have some supporting services for

123
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,919
the users to collaborate like simple for

124
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,099
the mailing list rocket chat that is

125
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,469
widely used to communicate among users

126
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:10,059
and a third pattern media drop for video

127
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:16,419
publication there are a lot of self

128
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,729
development and project that started

129
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,069
with the needs of efnet

130
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,319
as I said before there are some

131
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,479
primordial Drupal modules that let users

132
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,589
create domain names and associate to

133
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:42,070
resources this information is the blade

134
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,670
that is reply it to replicate it sorry

135
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,720
for all the DNS servers of the network

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,290
so that are geographically distributed

137
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,940
among the different geographical areas

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,519
also there are packets that its name in

139
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:09,209
SNP service that those are the snps n be

140
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:15,279
collecting and service as read the tool

141
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,139
images to the web page also we have

142
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,680
developed

143
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,050
meriting framework that is use it a lot

144
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,360
in the network and is

145
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,950
it started like 2009 and it's actively

146
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,910
developed right now and we also have

147
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,339
some tools for managing the proxy access

148
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,450
that is the principal way of accessing

149
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,890
internet in the beginning of the project

150
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,529
also definite has collaborated in

151
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,800
several European projects that involves

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,839
research for example confin'd project

153
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,380
that lets developers try application and

154
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,730
services and we bid that our that is a

155
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,829
framework for testing on commodity with

156
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,850
the hardware also some projects like our

157
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,320
AP models and a distro for installing

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:34,649
services already introduced many of the

159
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,700
tools and the concepts thank you very

160
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,959
much like you know check well it's not

161
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,370
we have a big issue with the with the

162
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,579
projects we developed a little the the

163
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,470
its dissemination many people in the

164
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,100
network doesn't even exist the that

165
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,720
don't even know that it exists they

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,019
exist and the long-term funding and

167
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,810
maintenance for instance we we had this

168
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,329
the European projects but now they are

169
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,120
done it's a little bit difficult to pay

170
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,449
someone to actively develop such complex

171
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,750
tools so any idea or suggestion on this

172
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
will be very very welcome so regarding

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,750
the social project very similar to

174
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,670
whatever you know already already

175
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,170
mentioned we consider the access to

176
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,610
telecommunications and the internet to

177
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,120
be a human human right so we work

178
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,399
towards that we want to facilitate

179
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,620
access to the communications and the

180
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,750
internet and access that is a four-level

181
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,660
so it doesn't discriminate on on how

182
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,630
rich people or poor people it's for

183
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,010
everyone we put special importance on

184
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,250
the fact that that some people

185
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,589
typically left behind can access the

186
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,149
internet like people in the rural areas

187
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,610
where it all began and what we call the

188
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,290
phonetic Community Network because we

189
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,329
feel a community we we know each other

190
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,000
locally in the different areas now and

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,240
we're a pretty diverse pretty diverse

192
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,889
community of course we would like to be

193
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,050
more diverse but I think it's okay

194
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,709
right now there are volunteers that

195
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,680
participate in its expansion we have all

196
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,360
kinds of associations that I get so that

197
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,199
introduce you before give advices yeah

198
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,490
pretty big associations we have

199
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,779
companies that work on top of giving net

200
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,029
and provide services on the maintenance

201
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,709
or installation of nodes and

202
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,870
infrastructure we have a co of course

203
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,100
the users we we consider users to be

204
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
also part of the the community we share

205
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,350
their interests and we have the public

206
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,600
administrations that that helped that

207
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,050
the help the network deploy by giving us

208
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,709
access to some key play 60 locations or

209
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,120
is in the the legislation as well we

210
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,500
have this very clear rules that I

211
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,079
mentioned you before we have this free

212
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,339
open lead wha nura free open neutral

213
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,209
network Commons which like like the GPL

214
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,870
license or yeah everyone that

215
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,839
participates in the in the network in

216
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,759
the physical network itself must accept

217
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,480
it explicitly by signing it okay and

218
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,850
this is the the base for everything else

219
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,269
in the network like some of these

220
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,559
governance tools like a complete

221
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,769
resolution system that we apply when

222
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:42,880
there are not so agreeable situations

223
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,279
but there are hospital to work pretty

224
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,170
well and the foundation okay

225
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,490
the foundation is like a legal

226
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,220
personality for the network whenever it

227
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,559
is needed but it is not the owner of the

228
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,350
of the definite it is not if net itself

229
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,150
it's a tool for giving it

230
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,880
and someone to guard for the for the

231
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,800
network to develop according to the to

232
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,100
the rules that I mentioned before okay

233
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,529
legally is well it's a private

234
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,670
not-for-profit foundation it has many

235
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,940
other roles that you can see here and it

236
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,410
is a telecommunications operating

237
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,270
expenses which are still is research

238
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,910
resistor as so such and it it can

239
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,150
provide access to other ISPs that want

240
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,940
to to share this this connection in the

241
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,910
Endicott Nix in the new exchange point

242
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,880
in in Barcelona a bit mention before

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,360
okay and that's a common resource pool

244
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,870
okay this is a concept that was

245
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,100
described by Elinor Ostrom its Nobel

246
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,260
Prize winner she introduced this this

247
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,800
concept and this is this has existed for

248
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,830
millennia for for people for people

249
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,940
running a resources that that must be

250
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,830
shared in several people like the earth

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,800
fields or things like that it's a very

252
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,070
very old concept well and when using

253
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,180
such a resource concurrently one one

254
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,050
must make an economic economic and

255
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:30,250
installation of it now so by everyone by

256
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,230
the fact that everyone uses the same the

257
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,440
same resource pool and develops it

258
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,220
together we can we can manage to to make

259
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,640
a more efficient use of it and to avoid

260
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,920
some kind of duplicity that that other

261
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,170
ISPs and telcos

262
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,170
produce just because everyone has to

263
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,990
have their line and pay for it and he's

264
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,170
very efficient we do not have that so

265
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,240
all participants cooperate in the

266
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,120
development and service providers can

267
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,980
offer their services at the price or

268
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
there are cities that offer them for

269
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,839
members that many many kinds of models

270
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,529
running on top of it

271
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,230
well these are some of the of the

272
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,750
professional services or offered in the

273
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,029
in the network you will see internet

274
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,339
access in the bottom because if you net

275
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,500
it is like a big local local network but

276
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,160
it is not that does not provide access

277
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,650
to the internet by default so one of the

278
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,150
ways of the many ways to access the

279
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,220
Internet besides what proxy some things

280
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,260
like that are these are the ISPs that

281
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,990
operate on top of of giving it which are

282
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,730
pretty competitive and much cheaper than

283
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,260
another and another I spit in Spain by

284
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,080
by grace of using this share share

285
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,910
common pool resource ok so to avoid

286
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,380
another topic in the in the 200 topic in

287
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,880
in common pool resource handling which

288
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,679
is the tragedy of the Commons that is

289
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,140
that someone uses the resource but

290
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,900
doesn't provide any anything to make it

291
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,300
grow we have this compensation system

292
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,579
that applies to the let's say big

293
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,859
players in the in the network like

294
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,449
biggest piece big associations

295
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,000
volunteers that put a lot of effort so

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,170
we run this this system that where you

297
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,730
can compensate collectively the the

298
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,800
resources that you put and the the

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,179
benefit that you get from the from the

300
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,059
network

301
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:42,760
ok so to summarize we we have proved in

302
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,290
these years that this kind of model can

303
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,150
work we have this sophisticated

304
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,010
compensation system that has been

305
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,330
awarded by the European Union and in

306
00:17:51,330 --> 00:18:00,460
2015 I think a 16 there was another

307
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,980
network Scottish networking which is

308
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,830
community network that's also good but a

309
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,220
similar price so yes we have the the

310
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,880
recognition of the European it's I think

311
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,429
we can it has proved sufficiently that

312
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,920
this can be a model for future for

313
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,929
future access to the for providing

314
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,000
access to the to the internet to

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
everyone in an affordable

316
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,659
yeah you know this isn't this isn't a

317
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,360
socially good way so thank you very much

318
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,289
for listening

319
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:42,710
any questions we'll play this this video

320
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,590
in the background while you what you

321
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:58,220
have a few questions questions first

322
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:12,980
times so the first question is how do we

323
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,210
provide Internet access or whatever

324
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,059
for example I can explain the exo use of

325
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,230
case they use IP IP tunnels but there

326
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,840
are from there are ISPs that use ipv6

327
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:37,490
mainly and do not operator for the ipv4

328
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,130
for example there are many techniques

329
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,190
use it it depends on the and the

330
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,730
operator itself

331
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,490
ah well it you asked about the rotting

332
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,720
and yeah you are asking that how we

333
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,639
manage the routing in all the network

334
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:17,620
well we use mainly BGP and and well

335
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,950
there are some partitions on the network

336
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,580
they start as affluent and the users

337
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,039
decide which protocol use and then when

338
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,820
they join the network there are some

339
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,210
problems that we must solve using

340
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,519
filters or any technique

341
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,270
so question is how did the political

342
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,220
situation in Barcelona Hotel and

343
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,680
influence Lee how it influenced the

344
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,220
growth of we change something so I

345
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,710
wouldn't be sure to say about this to me

346
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,370
project was was born in some way to

347
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,590
support the very quick deployment of a

348
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,340
mesh network

349
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,550
it's qmp is this cute quick mesh project

350
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,140
so I don't know if you can consider this

351
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,940
to be supporting some kind of political

352
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:56,300
movement the movement in Barcelona with

353
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,660
very life in the last year's we got

354
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,260
support from them but the no it's we are

355
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,980
very informal ways of getting support I

356
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:15,320
will be able to there is some interest

357
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,400
as we can see and social meetings that

358
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:46,610
the so regarding how does people sign

359
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,490
this agreement

360
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,180
in the comments how do with it how is

361
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,480
that they have to register on the

362
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,090
website so they can play the note of the

363
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,850
network and configure it and for

364
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,440
existing you have to accept the contract

365
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,980
so one per user and with user or with a

366
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,530
user you have to you need a user to

367
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,830
create a note we assume that they really

368
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:22,690
turned as all the services do good when

369
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,090
introducing the concept of or the

370
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:39,810
network we told by saying it yeah

371
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,240
so the question is if X is an ISP and

372
00:23:50,240 --> 00:24:02,960
how do we get if we need to connect

373
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,510
directly to to the Excel in the CAD Nick

374
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,390
so we mask all over other nodes the

375
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,070
infrastructure of Givi net is the the

376
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,620
free part and an EXO it's available

377
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,559
through giving it no so we in particular

378
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,780
we have a machine and the the Cognex

379
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,429
hosted with other machines of giving it

380
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,830
of the foundation and through definite

381
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,799
we reach these servers and then we

382
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,770
establish tunnels

383
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,780
another thing exact technology but it's

384
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,400
done like this III think it's done like

385
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,409
this for other ISPs you reach their

386
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:49,940
servers and there are some optical fiber

387
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,100
links from the connects and there are

388
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,950
some equipment connected directly by

389
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:02,799
this optical fiber links I'm an example

390
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,960
he's asking that if you can connect

391
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,900
directly to the connects yes you can

392
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:16,820
good he's fortunate he's one for do a

393
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,350
tour and all that connects directly to

394
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,939
the town building where

395
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:35,809
[Applause]
