1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
should be quite easy

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,279
you just need to read the slide if you

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:07,840
cannot hear me

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,270
so first welcome to skip the wrench for

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,090
listening about me speaking about docker

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,610
and on three board innovating my name is

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,560
Michael and I would start to us please

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,980
take picture of me like do not want to

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,290
do that and if I do not tell two people

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,020
they do that where I am beside the

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,259
French speaking or the sysadmin guy we

12
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,390
do not want to take picture system

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,309
administrator at reddit which is a

14
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,370
company that you may have off for the

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,750
open source and startup team which is a

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,210
team that you likely not ever heard of

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,290
which is helping upstream strategic

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,860
project from reddit to be successful so

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,060
most of the time that means doing

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,100
configure on the commercial management

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,750
community management design system

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,090
administration when you get a system and

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,190
mistreated by a developer you can

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,079
imagine oh but it is right it's exactly

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,850
that but worst and so my life so far

26
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,950
been since three doing that

27
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,520
managing restaurateur manager q dot org

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,720
deploying cloud and this kind of stuff

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,090
we want to get infrastructure maintained

30
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,550
by the community which means most of the

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,080
time being maintained by the same

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,210
developer that most of the time did a

33
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,960
suboptimal mess when given the root

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,310
access and I did that first by being a

35
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,090
bad guy

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,420
I like pipette very much except that for

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,909
people who already have used pipette

38
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,580
it's harder to install an order for

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,190
developer to group so I started to look

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,710
at unstable because it was simple

41
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,560
each time I was giving a talk everywhere

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,420
lots of people knew about it and say

43
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,950
yeah therapy but it's slow and

44
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,920
everything so we know just to make sure

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,900
everybody did heard about unstable can

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,110
raise their hand just to check okay so

47
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,460
that we still are from the people who

48
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,110
didn't so you're going to have a five

49
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:10,810
slide on that I can speak up okay I is

50
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,140
it better

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,500
okay so let's go back to on SeaWorld so

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,110
on Siebel is an orchestration tool for

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,520
people who are not assignment because I

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,780
know that which you don't anyway things

55
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,970
that's running some tasks on your

56
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,700
cluster or server vanishes sometime a

57
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,590
cluster of one single server sometime

58
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,470
it's much bigger and something like

59
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,720
deploying a new application shutting it

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,760
down shutting the monitoring because you

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,410
do not want to get page at the same time

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,660
and everything people started to use

63
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,480
that for orchestrations then move to

64
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,700
deployment when compared to a pipette

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,070
one of the big advantages is it's

66
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,070
agentless which mostly means that you do

67
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,470
not depend on one specific reduction of

68
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,410
the agent it just used by default or SSH

69
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,360
but we will see later that it can use

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
something else such as the quran

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,730
container it's really simple to explain

72
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,410
what it does that's why it's not a good

73
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,450
topic for presentation because in five

74
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,590
minutes you have already explained

75
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,780
everything so but just the concept of a

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,060
remote execution of module for example

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,560
if you want to get fired it's quite easy

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
you just use that which will shut down

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,130
or your server which as I said is own

80
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,780
bad for prediction but it's nice to test

81
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,370
what happened in case of catastrophic

82
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,400
that the server is not enough I mean

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,930
there is also the concept of playbook

84
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,290
which is executing a set of step based

85
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,560
on a llamar file because XML was toured

86
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,299
so we decided to use our Yammer

87
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,610
so it's like a script a bad it's

88
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,650
not a script I say that because there is

89
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,299
a lot of people who come we say yeah I

90
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,090
would like to do that do that and that

91
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,350
basically what I want is a bash script

92
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,230
or Python script but it's not a script

93
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,150
it's supposed to be different if you

94
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,680
want to get Python write it or not that

95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,600
the with Python if you want to do power

96
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,040
you can do power if you want to do Ruby

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,420
you can also do power it's almost the

98
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,640
same and it's one of the new hotness

99
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,548
I was last week at a conference in the

100
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,669
Czech Republic and I have a trick when I

101
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,919
want to go speak about something I just

102
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,120
write word we do

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,820
with on sabor for anything like this

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,530
afternoon it will be Sdn with Jean

105
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,290
Seberg today it's a container with on

106
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:33,830
3-ball

107
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,169
I did try community with on seaboard

108
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,930
this one got refused but on both of the

109
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,940
time it work and I was like something

110
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,250
ten torque it was aware that sponsor

111
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,570
come from so that's why a lot of people

112
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,540
are speaking about on Seabourn yeah it's

113
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,130
quite popular among developer because

114
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,930
it's simple each time I try to do

115
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,400
trainings I ask me directly is a

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,870
complicated question instead of the

117
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,520
simple stuff that I did prepare because

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,889
I'm season mean I'm lazy if I can just

119
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,750
read the documentation for people in

120
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,490
action or food I will do it it or not

121
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,490
that's not what I want I want my brain

122
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,169
not like zombie like developer when if

123
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,960
the difference is not that abuse at

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,440
first and speaking about stuff popular

125
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,080
among developer so there is docker same

126
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,539
everybody did docker someone coming from

127
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,250
Mars where there is no Internet's in

128
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,850
three years

129
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,789
no ten people who heard about docker

130
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,360
razor and okay so that's animals as

131
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,060
popular on Seabourn but some since

132
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,370
people didn't raise their hand

133
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,800
well again five slide it's not at all

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,950
Schiller for the conference I promise so

135
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,410
what is the curve the curve is also the

136
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,500
new hotness which is revolution the

137
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,120
revolution last year was cloud now it's

138
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,550
container and it's a container enjoying

139
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,800
which managed build and one container

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,060
most of the time when we say container

141
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,520
to old system in the Rita yeah the solar

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
array stuff added sea or whatever and

143
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,880
this time it's completely different it's

144
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,470
not like we are taking the same stuff

145
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,960
and we packaging for marketing reason I

146
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,430
mean that's not what happened in the

147
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,630
industry at all the IDE is mostly to get

148
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,729
prepackaged single process execution

149
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,250
environment mostly for micro services

150
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,530
people that have been there since a long

151
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,479
time things that are micro services is

152
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,490
all stuff that's what we got with our

153
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,310
enterprise javabean and as far and all

154
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,770
kind of trendy technology from the last

155
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,820
ten year it had to manage of the network

156
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,250
the disk and everything and so it's it's

157
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,930
I'm a sysadmin and I think that being a

158
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,880
sysadmin mean balls and just playing

159
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,360
quake

160
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,229
complaining about developer okay so if

161
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,909
suddenly I start to be a much louder

162
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,590
it's because someone is fixing the audio

163
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,229
it's not because I want to really it's

164
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,120
not because I'm really motivated by Daka

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,659
so I tried I try to use a docker first

166
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,939
to solve my problem my first problem was

167
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,520
to learn to Jodi for some federal server

168
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,650
with an old version of prosody because I

169
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,599
like to live dangerously I use federal

170
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,360
on my server and it turned out that well

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,289
you do not work that well the reason

172
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,569
[Music]

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,779
it's not because someone is trying to

174
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,129
replace me and it's not the Duke a

175
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,639
people trying to shut me down either

176
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,550
so we first add some issue well-known we

177
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,370
first I first add an issue we stopped

178
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,219
talking to me using really with your ID

179
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,379
information because docker is supposed

180
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,930
to be free easily kid like you have your

181
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,639
dock environment and it's not supposed

182
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,979
to communicate except using the web West

183
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,500
API and everything like this so yeah

184
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,240
first tribe right problem is your ID

185
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,669
information okay not working so gonna

186
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,650
attempt one of my work is building

187
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,839
static website and we are using your

188
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,979
wonderful will be middleware which is

189
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,110
wonderful because thanks to it I'm never

190
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,500
out of block I mean I will be likely be

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,569
forced to maintain it until the end of

192
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,460
my life which is great because lot of

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,050
people are looking for work and I have

194
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,319
more than enough and of course because

195
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,150
this is Ruby this is using all kind of

196
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,819
gem and we did eat some issue about

197
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,129
sketching with dokuro so it quickly

198
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,529
worked to phone from thousand nope not

199
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,839
solving an issue so then I said okay

200
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,000
it's not working for the steps that you

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,620
are going to use but what about the use

202
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,779
case of docker which is using your own

203
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,929
customer code and it turned out that

204
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,870
well ten years ago I was trying to learn

205
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,440
Django so I took the tutorial I created

206
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,029
my own blog and join because it's

207
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,620
tutorial for jungle

208
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,190
and yeah I decided to modernize it which

209
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,460
is mostly or moving to jungle 1/2 1.2

210
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,480
1.1 1.3 and roofing and it's quite great

211
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,670
I did with or the release note and out

212
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,560
for the code good to be torn away that's

213
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,470
so nice with a development and it was

214
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,100
the same

215
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,779
it was taking lots of time despite

216
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,550
catching because the Duke afraid was

217
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,380
inside the source code so everything at

218
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,540
we start from scratch the application

219
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,920
was a three different docker image so I

220
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,170
was making a modification waiting 10

221
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,970
minutes playing quick seeing it break

222
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,730
making modification and everything again

223
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,370
you know develop our best practice so I

224
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,500
said yeah maybe I'm not doing it right

225
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,779
and I started to look at the dockerfile

226
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,220
best practice and the first one is do

227
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,540
not use wood which is something that

228
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,610
it's quite nice because nobody does that

229
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,650
everybody started wishing in wood and

230
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,690
when you are wood inside the container

231
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,210
it's the same outside I mean everybody

232
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,220
I've seen matrix-y narrow is wood inside

233
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,890
the Rodricks managed to do stuff outside

234
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,959
which is a plot or in the movie but

235
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,470
which is a rarity in the case of docker

236
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,390
there is that so the word part about

237
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,860
cleaning your system after in standing

238
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,100
package which make docker file so

239
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,240
whatever because suddenly you have line

240
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,750
that we have to get to screen just to be

241
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,360
displayed with the world part about that

242
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,800
you are squashing and all of these are

243
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,330
something that should be done by default

244
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,490
and it's on other word you cannot do

245
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,970
because the format is frozen but as far

246
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,500
as I know and if there is so much from

247
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,810
docker that can tell to me I'm wrong I

248
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,730
would be happy to change that slide it

249
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,050
would be too late because so a

250
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,440
presentation is recorded but it's not

251
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,110
formally specified so that means that

252
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,690
well you cannot do any change but you

253
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,330
cannot make another implementation it's

254
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,360
also not extensible I mean lots of

255
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,020
people are likely maybe packaged 100 a

256
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,570
p.m. work in a p.m. you have a p.m.

257
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,029
macro which is well nice when it works

258
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,650
quite overboard when you're done

259
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,720
don't you have GB on come on you have

260
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,700
image function and everything each time

261
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,650
you want to do a package and the docker

262
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,270
image is basically a package because you

263
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,910
want to distribute

264
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,210
binary to be executed which is the world

265
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,640
with zone of having a package part you

266
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,970
do not have that extent extensibility

267
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,050
the same you do not have anything which

268
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,820
is matching with the board directly I

269
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,830
mean you can always do a parser but a

270
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,960
parser with something which is not

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
specified and using something not as

272
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,270
good as a XML and I mean if I say that I

273
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,820
would prefer XML than the format it's

274
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,830
quite bad for the format and that mean -

275
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,860
no abuse way to inform the policy for

276
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,170
example if you look at other packaging

277
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,540
system where you have packages on you

278
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,780
can trivially burn it look at the

279
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,730
content and then do whatever you want

280
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,700
and so yeah that most of the time

281
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,560
require manual change on first base best

282
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,600
practice for example you want to install

283
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,880
Apache but you need to install it and

284
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,170
then you need to clean everything

285
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,120
because you do not want to get crap

286
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,280
especially since you are likely using

287
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,490
the cloud and paying by the gigabyte of

288
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,510
image that you are using and yep there

289
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,160
is no script automation like you are

290
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,500
with rpm I don't know if people did a

291
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,290
p.m. I did write since 10 year but so is

292
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,640
that of stuff that are done in an

293
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,560
automated way that are not done there is

294
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,150
the world caching side effect so there

295
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,830
will you complain and I'm pretty sure

296
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,390
everybody that use docker did see that

297
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,250
it's like a make file but recursive yeah

298
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,620
the add operation is victress you so if

299
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,000
you have a good do Clefairy or no catch

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,210
and so i started to look at that and I

301
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,970
said ok what can I do to avoid do that

302
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,250
because you cannot fix it I mean I

303
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,660
cannot fix it because I move not a good

304
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,910
you proper but even if I was a good

305
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,620
repair I could not because I decided to

306
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,350
froze it which is also a good idea so

307
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,050
what can I do and uncivil is really

308
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,730
really flexible always people using it

309
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,820
inside whether for QA testing that you

310
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,400
find the bugs I get a playbook they give

311
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,410
it to the developer the developer run it

312
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,540
fix it and then so then it become a test

313
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,030
there is people using that for deploying

314
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,330
their own the number environment so with

315
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,970
people I was using that on netapp I was

316
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,060
using that for searching of directory of

317
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,550
user and everything so and the reason

318
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,590
for that is there is lot of plugin

319
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,060
on seaboard you can add your own module

320
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,850
and everything and one specific plugins

321
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,680
that people seem to overlook its

322
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,420
connection pregame by default on

323
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,750
seaboard use just ssh easier paramiku or

324
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,900
the command line in SSH there is

325
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,030
something for a stage foot so you can

326
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,590
instead of connecting for a remote

327
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,910
system you just connect to your own

328
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,450
stage which if you want to configure and

329
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,850
I did create something to run on Siebel

330
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,040
on top of funk if people do not remember

331
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Frank is like incorrect evil soul stack

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,010
but although I also did vote something

333
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,020
to run on Sybil on top of search tag

334
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,540
because it did look like a fan ID it

335
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,040
took me one year to fix and it's still

336
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,100
not working properly but still fun for

337
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,530
guests FS you give a if you have to our

338
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,720
machine or image you start it you modify

339
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
with uncivil you shut down

340
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,130
it's like Packer but using a my code and

341
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,560
so I started to say yeah maybe I can do

342
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,500
something with docker so I started first

343
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,380
by using NS exact docker walk with the

344
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,510
system of name space and you can use a

345
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,550
NS exec as your own petard Zuni or

346
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,320
working at docker water blow past and

347
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,630
said oh that looks like a smart ID and

348
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,980
it turned out that no it was not a smart

349
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,830
idea because a peer got refused one year

350
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,020
after the curve managed to get the

351
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,030
docker exact come on some on someone

352
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,780
decided to create a plugin for

353
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,090
connecting to a docker image directly it

354
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,580
got melt and then someone which is not

355
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,410
me because I'm not an unstable

356
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,420
container developer just an unstable

357
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,980
developer decided to create on simple

358
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,920
container like less than one year ago

359
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,950
and because the question is why do we

360
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,300
want to do that if you can do everything

361
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,850
directly with unstable and why do we

362
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,520
want to do that if you add VD have a

363
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,440
llamar file no not yet okay file so why

364
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,170
use on super container so first well

365
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,260
it's Jamel so it's kinda machine

366
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,390
readable which means that you can

367
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,720
enforce static checking another big

368
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,430
issue with docker file is that you

369
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,130
cannot reuse anything easily there is no

370
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,260
super for library or something like this

371
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,420
I do not know if there is something

372
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,340
plain for that or is there is a

373
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,410
community based practice I still

374
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,400
maintain

375
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,390
old stuff using old method I'm not using

376
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,940
this fancy look of stuff yet in

377
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,740
production waiting for people to deploy

378
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,529
your everything for that but with on

379
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,260
super container you can use the word so

380
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,760
word in on seaboard is a way to

381
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,580
basically just reuse the code you say

382
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,310
this error should be SQL Server like

383
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,250
Postgres my sequel SQL Lite if you want

384
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,740
I mean I will not judge your choice you

385
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,930
just paid everything and then you assign

386
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,660
the world to a server and that's it you

387
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,970
apply it deploy if you done your job

388
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,160
well everything work if you didn't

389
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,990
internet work you go back to fix and

390
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,470
that's it

391
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,839
so that permit to reuse code that permit

392
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,120
to do composition you want to deploy

393
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,870
something like another PHP BB PHP will

394
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,540
be require to get web server which I

395
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,150
have to get PHP okay or to get secret

396
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,279
database then you can compose it's

397
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,960
better because you can on fallback best

398
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,600
practice on Moodle side I should have

399
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,550
add something like to do because right

400
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,740
now if you are using anything to install

401
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,250
package you still need to clean you can

402
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,440
more easily deploy with a different base

403
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,860
image and you go to one single tool to

404
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,709
learn especially if you go to legacy

405
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,930
application I mean most people except in

406
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,430
startup who start from scratch

407
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,250
needs to maintain the old stuff like you

408
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,320
know the old Oracle database that permit

409
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,270
everybody to be paid because it turned

410
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,860
out to be quite important to get money

411
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,950
for your work and this has to work you

412
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,390
have the container infrastructure that

413
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,040
cannot be maintained in container from

414
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,290
well obvious reason and you have the

415
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,869
whole container deployment so I said

416
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,089
yeah once you got container is great but

417
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:13,510
are you

418
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,300
you put missing the abstract to show how

419
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,670
it works and everything so yeah I did

420
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,599
promise that so if you want to use it

421
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,280
you can right now you download from

422
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,800
github which is best practice curl pipe

423
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,170
something or you can use pip if someone

424
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,120
wants to make a package it would be very

425
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,090
very nice I'm too lazy to do one but I'm

426
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,530
pretty sure that people have more free

427
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,260
time than me it's not with the workflow

428
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,050
inspired by your Django and other so I

429
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,820
cannot say it's inspired by jongro but

430
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,840
that's what

431
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,610
the project that no in the sense that

432
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,529
you start by doing unstable container in

433
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:50,169
it in your source code it will create a

434
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,309
skeleton in a directory called unstable

435
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,710
which contains some file more than two

436
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,659
but I wanted that to be readable for

437
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,639
people in the back if they cannot hear

438
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:05,289
me at least they can read that the list

439
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,909
exactly file is somewhere in the

440
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,460
documentation I will plan to with the

441
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,570
complete documentation but at least

442
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,999
explain so first well if you want to

443
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,730
build a container well you got a ma file

444
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,909
which is called mange ml which is a

445
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,580
playbook that's exactly the kind of

446
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,440
playbook that you can use without on

447
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,059
simple containers that maybe you already

448
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,100
like maybe you already dislike but if

449
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,690
you dislike I think that you are not

450
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,789
going to use on super container so let's

451
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,999
pretend that everybody loves on the ball

452
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,070
you can use world and its executive

453
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,019
inside the docker container so it's like

454
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,539
managing your external services except

455
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,269
with container so it's better by

456
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,240
definition the inventory come from

457
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,639
container of the chavin which is a Yemen

458
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:51,309
file similar if I'm not phone to docker

459
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,009
compose similar to the point that you

460
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,539
are supposed to be able to take a docker

461
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,029
compose file and you likely use it for

462
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:59,830
container hmm

463
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,720
it's explicit if we turned somewhere in

464
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,100
a bag rip out that they want to keep

465
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,090
compatibility you can use there is an

466
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,039
environment variable if you want to get

467
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,629
or words that can be used inside and

468
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,549
outside of the container because again

469
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,679
most people do not migrate right away

470
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,840
and on two of you or the caramel you say

471
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,759
yeah that's nice it's taking space on my

472
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,549
disk what can I do is that all right it

473
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,409
or not that you can also run and deploy

474
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:26,649
them so everything goes back to cotton

475
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,649
HML as I said it's compatible to docker

476
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,809
compose in the sense that you can take

477
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,460
docker compose file from unstable

478
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,279
container but there is more addition for

479
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,649
example so with a system of ginger

480
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,899
variable our ginger is a templating

481
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,850
language used by unstable and used by

482
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,799
Python community and by the drongo

483
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,210
community if I'm not wrong so the file

484
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,879
contains a list of container the water

485
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:55,179
frame was not prepared you can list as a

486
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,100
batch image

487
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,640
the base image support the volume and

488
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,690
something which is quite interesting is

489
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,150
that you can decide to have an overall

490
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,010
ride from the configuration for specific

491
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,870
cold stuff like for development stuff

492
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,419
you can say okay it's running on the

493
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,120
developer laptop I do not want to

494
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,039
connect to the production database I

495
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,990
will change over over on one variable so

496
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,000
if someone do something like oh I want

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
to see if I can remove everything and

498
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,000
internal that where this was a

499
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,059
production database yeah no it will just

500
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,520
crash something locally you can do that

501
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,640
to do some smart stuff with using the

502
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,860
source code directly on the disk

503
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,960
so it's faster for developer to test and

504
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,760
break which is something that I was not

505
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,130
able to do in the past you look at you

506
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,679
can get option power deployment because

507
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,179
once you have everything you want to

508
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,539
deploy in under closer to eternal since

509
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,260
that's where that sponsored you have the

510
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,940
choice between country and work so you

511
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,340
can use openshift which is a tool on top

512
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,590
of community or directly cover to be on

513
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,400
AG if you want more it's on the roadmap

514
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,710
which means that there is a github burg

515
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,740
open from that it's waiting for someone

516
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,049
to purge the code since four months and

517
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,840
you can ship container which basically

518
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,549
do not mean to put them in a boat

519
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,980
somewhere in Amsterdam and move them

520
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,350
around the planet it just to push on a

521
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,429
remote or registry it's seven so great

522
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:27,870
that or you can just generate a

523
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,990
deployment playbook which then became

524
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,500
unstable playbook ship it to openshift

525
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,700
we don't know exactly what it does but

526
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,140
after there is profit and so the tool is

527
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,409
quite new you if it was older I would

528
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,230
have said more and the developer really

529
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,179
want to get all kind of feedback because

530
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,130
I are developers I do not know if that's

531
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,460
what you commit you want so I'm trying

532
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,250
to help them to get some awareness about

533
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,750
the tool I'm pretty sure that they will

534
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,850
be tomorrow there will be there

535
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,620
somewhere I do not know what they look

536
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,770
like and everybody looks the same but um

537
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,600
if you go to coffee management comes

538
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,010
there is an unstable track and you can

539
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,389
discuss with them say yes

540
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,279
good idea but what about that oh that's

541
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,839
a bad idea and I do not want to speak

542
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,909
you anymore and just disappear we can do

543
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,279
what you want and if you have any

544
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,329
question please do so or you can just do

545
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:23,489
like me and run to get something to eat

546
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:31,279
because it's the time to eat it was fast

547
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,739
no I do not believe in the power of live

548
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,690
demo because it never work but I can

549
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,759
make a non-working demo without problem

550
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,769
maybe it will work by your oh yeah so if

551
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:47,219
you've got a question is there a mic of

552
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:48,629
somewhere something or not to read it

553
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:49,769
you have to shout out and then you have

554
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,029
to repeat the question okay

555
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,599
[Music]

556
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,249
[Music]

557
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:46,870
okay okay so the question is running on

558
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,879
Seabourn inside dockerfile wizard into a

559
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,190
big image and people need to redownload

560
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,340
it and does the solution fix that I

561
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,370
think we don't where is no I know that

562
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,740
there is something variety to a layer

563
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,600
squashing which means that you will

564
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,539
still get a big image and I'm not sure

565
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,860
that on Siebel is the right place for

566
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,669
that

567
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:09,370
because if you judge change two bytes it

568
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,379
should be the synchronization used by

569
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:14,559
docker or the registry to be smart I

570
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,570
mean we have a thing since 20 years more

571
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,889
maybe they could implement that because

572
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,929
it will fix the issue for everybody

573
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,909
maybe there is technical reason to not

574
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,830
implement that I mean I do not know the

575
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,110
internal of the curves that well so does

576
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,379
that answer the question

577
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:38,220
or does that answer the question

578
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,610
No so the answer is no we do not have

579
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,750
anything to fix the forum

580
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
yep

581
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,909
can you speak up please

582
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,620
so there is a there is a big open for

583
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,020
supporting work at other the question

584
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,770
I cannot read it here so I would just

585
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:32,990
move okay sorry

586
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,210
so the question is either plan is a plan

587
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,030
to use a rocket I know there is a burger

588
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,100
pan I do not know always I want to use

589
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,670
it I suspect its pocket is compatible

590
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,560
with the doctor and you can use docker

591
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,380
image and everything whatever you use at

592
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,180
the back end do not matter that much and

593
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,730
it should be quite easy to do there is a

594
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,440
bug open someone requesting feedback and

595
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,050
working on it it's quite easy there is

596
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,150
like a five pull request and a forty

597
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,470
issue so it's quite easy to find that if

598
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,150
you are Python developer you can take a

599
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,250
look and test and say it's working it's

600
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,560
not working I think there is some

601
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,600
interest each other there is two people

602
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,490
right now on the project and they are

603
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,930
traveling around to speak about the

604
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:31,860
project so if people didn't let work to

605
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,680
contact me there is my email and that's

606
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,860
it

607
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:46,689
[Applause]
