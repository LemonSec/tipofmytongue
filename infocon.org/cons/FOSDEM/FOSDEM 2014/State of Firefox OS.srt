1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,000
so

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,280
um I'm going to play into arm where
we're at the moment with Firefox OS

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,049
what's we did last year what we are
doing in the moments

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,230
aunts were what we're where we're
heading acts for the next few weeks a

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,640
month

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,670
and the very first thing I would like to
talk about saw the devices

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,480
so this has been

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,929
the very big thing for 2013 we had

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,420
one clear goal ship the phone so

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,410
it's been some time frustrating because
it was not so you're with a group

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,349
I run the code as much as we wanted what
we wanted to have the features

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,690
as quickly as possible to test them as
soon as possible without partners with

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,468
the manufacturer's the operators

14
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,020
an

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,700
hands it's been a success because we've
had

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,950
we've shipped three phones the Digi open

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,590
that most of you might know already the
Alcatel

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,120
one-touch and the algae

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,240
file web so

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,380
um I've tried to prepare a part of

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,149
to show you call we translate in terms
of market share

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,260
but basically this is how

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,260
we're entering the Belfield so we're not
a big stretch yes

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,990
but where on the battlefield and that's
what we wanted

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,780
so

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,930
what's interesting about this about this
experience is that those three little

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,640
babies

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,910
has been shipped to 14 count Res a
mostly

29
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,830
South America and Europe and where all
the

30
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,590
I am we have already seventeen operators
who are committed

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,200
to shipper Firefox OS device pretty much
all around the world

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,190
so were not so big competitor and Isabel
affiliates

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,110
but were there and where about to be
ready to beam

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,929
pretty much everywhere in the world so
that's been our biggest you've been

35
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,690
flosser

36
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,079
and it's been quite a quite enjoyed it
to get there

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,120
missiles these

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
end-user devices we have the locker
devices those two dicks phones

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,860
are have been present to hear lost your
this same room

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,990
we had a tough one hr community member

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,260
who went to to show those and they're
still working great as the

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,679
developer devices we

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,670
sort of supports arm all the devices
like the Nexus S and Nexus 4

44
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,280
it's not an official supports it's more
a community-driven efforts to make

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,410
Firefox OS

46
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,819
work on those butts it's not the point

47
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,099
where a dedicated team wearing more not
Google

48
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,760
so we're focusing on-chip flash phones
and knots

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,820
on making Firefox OS were coming system
devices

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,430
I know it can be frustrating are here
this slots that people would like to

51
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,700
install Firefox OS on their own device

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,010
they have an old jocks yes to whatever
that would like to

53
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,060
reboot with Firefox OS and no

54
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm afraid the short answer is it's not
easy to do its

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,070
so pure please bear with that's where

56
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,209
working hard to make Firefox OS a

57
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,280
real competitor and as a mole OS

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,470
and I think we have some pretty good
chance to make it happen

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,560
but this has a cost and this cost is
that

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,160
we cannot afford working young making
this work come

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,430
all the devices so here's a

62
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,310
technical review of what we did last
year in 2013

63
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,450
on I'm starting from the

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,899
most visible changes to the most under
the hoodlums

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,160
so the first thing we've been doing has
been

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,520
to I am do some visual refresh so on the
left side this is a Firefox was one that

67
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,210
0 and 1.3 on the right side so it's

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,300
all manner details we've lowered the
contrasts

69
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,199
with refine the icons um all the

70
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,650
status bar codes on the on the above
have been

71
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,080
I'll switch to monochrome icons which
are much lighter in the eye

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,340
so it's so just my refinements

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,340
I hope you like it we've been doing a
lot to work should come in addition aP's

74
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,160
so I would guess here because I mean
this condition acting

75
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,020
but a we've had it last year some
support form

76
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,960
for Ms for conference calls for jolson

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,520
which is so an important feature for the
markets that's where all targeting

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,919
and I am for you

79
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,099
who want to use this as your arm arm

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,310
test phone or y'all may be a favorite
former your unit phone

81
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,669
a there's been a very significant
progress sir regarding the contacts

82
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,378
import and export suits now

83
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,460
much easier to import existing contacts
from Gmail

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,068
outlook off from you all the device all
we have to do is to export to contact

85
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,680
lists is a bit of fire

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,129
and we can import this all we can really
explore this is a video file

87
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,629
we can even writes those contacted the
SIM card

88
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,270
I never saw this would happen but it
did. I'm glad I did

89
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,318
so now we're pretty much on par with the

90
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,900
Russian the smartphones photo funny
parts

91
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,960
so this is another a

92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,659
before the prairie Preston to be able to
ship phones

93
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,580
and this is where up at the moment

94
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,248
there's been a bunch of other app
improvements Arnott's

95
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:57,249
going to list them all we have some
release notes

96
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,430
the most visible part is the new
lockscreen so now there's only one just

97
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,129
turned to unlock your phone instead of

98
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:06,069
to jesters we if you've used 1.0 1.1

99
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,340
you had to us but its Bowman then bitch

100
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,698
either unlock our camera so this has
been improved

101
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,449
media app has been very much improved

102
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,830
now we have mellowed haitian we support
male drafts

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,840
we have attachments reason we can
display and Senate catchments

104
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,219
we have a dolla manager to give you a
list of the files that you

105
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,439
from basically it's interesting for all
the father cannot

106
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,590
that you cannot open dark to the phone
like if you're downloading a

107
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,969
zip archive all whatever watches knots

108
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,779
a the media file this is where you
follow an

109
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,808
in the gala manager

110
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:53,339
where when we started with won the 2011
form we were focused on one resolution

111
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,860
which was halted GA

112
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,860
and now we're supporting are mall to
result from this place

113
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,089
so there's been the Dick's phone a mmm
Beach

114
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:07,789
but they're all we're getting ready for
all the devices as well

115
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,969
an more in general we've been

116
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:14,169
doing a lot of work to improve the
performance

117
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:17,339
mostly on startup time and

118
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,479
awning banning to have a smooth
scrolling experience

119
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,870
we still have some room for improvement
in this parts but we've already made

120
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,939
some significant improvements

121
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,020
if you're still on 1.1 I suggest you to
try one the three

122
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,859
it feels much snap you're ready

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,729
yes 1.0 so when we started Firefox OS

124
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,969
we were and these days on gecko 18 it
was the

125
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,808
overall maybe nightly when we started
though

126
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,360
Firefox OS 1.0 and with

127
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,099
been stuck with this skit a branch for

128
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,438
well one your a bit more so

129
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,900
we had to drawl branch which is called
me to Jay team which is a branch object

130
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,080
watching

131
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,308
and we've worked with this branch for a
very long time and starting with Firefox

132
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:12,789
OS 1.2

133
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,349
we've moved to a 12-week recycle

134
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,400
as you know Firefox itself has a
six-week recycle so this means that

135
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,929
every five bucks was version CaRMS with
the

136
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,939
your every even number %uh get
commission

137
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,870
so now we on March healthy your release
I kill it means that we can

138
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,000
benefits from gecko improvements on a
very regular basis

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
one of the things that have been missing
in Firefox OS 10 2011 upon was flex box

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,060
which has arrived in a jekyll 19

141
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,329
so close yet so far so one your

142
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,790
developing your mobile interfaces will
flex box

143
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,069
has been quite frustrating so these days
are over

144
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,080
if you all are interested in
contributing some code to Firefox OS now

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,130
a the good news is you're going to have
a mother gecko

146
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,000
whatever chance you're working on

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,450
oh yeah and this is a

148
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,890
blow them problem the most life-changing

149
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,860
I'll change the most life-changing tall
we've had lost your

150
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,900
the developer the death tolls team has
been doing an awesome work

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,189
a the application manager allows you to
do some remote debugging

152
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,150
remote inspecting on the device I'm
sorry didn't repair in the demo because

153
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,770
so i thought id would have been the
presented earlier

154
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,949
and there's no but if you're interested
in this I can do a quick demo

155
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,980
after the after this talk to see how it
works

156
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,730
its much I'll

157
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,430
much cleaner 2002 worked with this
because you don't have to flash a phone

158
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,680
and

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,329
you just have to arm do some light
addition on your

160
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,740
darker from your laptop it's much more
efficient

161
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,100
so if your words with Firefox OS 1.0 1.1

162
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,360
and have been I

163
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,649
um struggling with the flash enrich our
experience

164
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,670
those days are over mostly and this has
been our Christmas gif

165
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,459
so a a synchronous pan and zoom

166
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,510
the idea is to perform panning and
zooming

167
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,010
a synchronously on the composite the
thread

168
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,779
instead of doing its on the main thread
so obviously the idea is

169
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,560
to have the us move her a pending
experience

170
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,859
and the we landed this right before the
Christmas break

171
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,779
remember I'll pushing into production on
Friday that's what we did

172
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,300
for some reason we have a few issues to
fix in the front and side now

173
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,410
but is that a good shape so arm

174
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,360
you can enable or disable a this is a
crisp an enzyme thing

175
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,050
from the developer setting so I don't
remember if now it's an able by default

176
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,290
or disabled by default

177
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,269
it's enabled by default now so if you
find some strange but it might be worth

178
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,380
a to go to the developer said his panel

179
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,689
try to disable a is seen through
spending zoom

180
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,240
and see if it fixes the bug in this case

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,760
you have the right number to report so
another

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,709
AP's the glitch but it's getting open
muscle to the other the moment

183
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,430
if you interesting in to the technical
parts arm

184
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,479
have a look at the wicked you'll
probably have

185
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,850
more information about that that's what
you wanted to have it's pretty to me

186
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,459
first-rate sorry I recommend reading
this

187
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:49,949
and now here's what we have in mind for
2014

188
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,750
so again I'm knots

189
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,120
are going to give you the whole road map
which is on them is a week in

190
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,459
but I would like to talk about arm

191
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,579
one experiments wall more than the
experiment now

192
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,949
it's a real project its go hard up and

193
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,760
its arm this is how

194
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,920
we would like each the user experience
on the mobile device

195
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,120
but to become we would like this to be
more web ish to be more

196
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,420
million so we

197
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,189
instead of having the some return

198
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,720
we want to simplify the whole experience
want to me

199
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,920
made the contents more dark accessible

200
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,930
so we have a few items that have been
identified

201
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,219
the first one all what we call edge
gestures

202
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,240
so I'm sorry we don't have any camera
here to show

203
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,250
how it works on the on the big screen so

204
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,180
hope you're going to be able to imagine
how it looks like from

205
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,060
this fall so

206
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,680
this is the way about switching
application by

207
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,680
a higher impressive of try to visualize
some lens

208
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,190
it will be bigger so were just a swap

209
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,040
swiping to get to know to get from the
petition to another this is

210
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,069
the out that and besides the all tab

211
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:29,079
we have they a spotlights for March
users

212
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,079
all the activities but none for users

213
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,310
which we call the rocket bar so

214
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,839
this is a central points where you can
search

215
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,290
among the news as bookmarks your history

216
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,550
the contacts or hopefully a

217
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,769
process in the marketplace everything
not be so

218
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,300
one central points to access all your
data so if you're looking for contact

219
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,649
for web page

220
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,959
its a the central place to enter

221
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,699
to three letters sent it completes where
r

222
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:08,370
this is the the cool thing well one of
the cool things about this project

223
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,459
where a integrating the brosser directly
to the system

224
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,060
so there won't be any browser app itself

225
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,518
everything in the browser the whole
devices the web

226
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,050
so this simplifies is this implies a
lots the experience and it makes it much

227
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,050
more consistent

228
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,309
much more whether ish and the this
should be an able

229
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:36,459
in the next few weeks and we also want
to have better customization

230
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:43,180
making the home screen replaceable and
lock screen to be customizable Zazzle

231
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,189
so going are no fun more information on
the wiki

232
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,660
its to a moving target so from

233
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,449
not everything is very well defined the
moment but the good thing is

234
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,339
are you can only try the edge gestures
and the rocket bar to see

235
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,050
a how to change those the experience

236
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,089
in you just need a recent built

237
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,610
and go to the developer Settings panel
enable those two items

238
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,610
and though you're pretty much that

239
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,750
to make this happen tonight hi to happen
a

240
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,439
we need new with ATI's the first one
that we are working on my is the data

241
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,130
story PRI

242
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,140
so they distort is about this arm

243
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,069
being able to share some data across
several laps

244
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,300
which is not possible at the moment so
this is what we need to

245
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,649
make the central search to make the
rocket bar a

246
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,779
work so we have to make sure they resort
to work properly

247
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,589
and we have to a adapts the various apt
to use the data store instead of their

248
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,800
own API's that the word using so far so
for Facebook contacts

249
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,359
bookmarks history I am I think it works
only for the contacts

250
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,449
%uh not just for the bookmarks but

251
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,029
again you can follow all the progress on
this blog Pittsburgh or

252
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:13,500
87 1445 and have a look at the way the
PR if you want to know

253
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,130
if you want to help us happen it's it
will be more than welcome

254
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,290
another big piece on the jekyll sides

255
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,829
all the showed workers so

256
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,620
are you probably own though a web
workers

257
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,149
if you don't have a look it's so

258
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,620
the one-way to a paralyzed some pasta
and JS

259
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,399
Jas is basically amo the thread SoCon to
borrow some task you have to use some

260
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,970
from

261
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,000
workers someone workers and we want to
have

262
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,640
showed workers to me so we can collar
worker from different aP's

263
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,010
the car already is that's we want to
enable

264
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,620
way the PRI's in what workers

265
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,470
so there's a a bug to try to this song

266
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,649
all these were the PR the login enabling
where boaters

267
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,380
most important of course data store
index to be but also

268
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,500
the large storage almost contacts to see
socket

269
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,250
there's a long list so I will be charged
that won't to enable Wayne

270
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,898
a those showed workers is getting
prioritized

271
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:22,648
it's been prioritize I think so arm

272
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:26,408
this is making good progress and I hope
art will

273
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:33,409
bring some and hence experience for the
end-user in the next few months

274
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,918
and

275
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,890
one of the common question that we've
had about this project is

276
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,730
where's the tablets was the tablet UI

277
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,260
remember the first goal for 2013 shibi
phone

278
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,090
we don't have much time to work on the
tail issue I we haven't had much time to

279
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,189
work on that last year

280
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,390
worst we've been making good progress on
the tablet UI

281
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,550
an what would like to propose you now

282
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,530
is to help us building Firefox or
something that's

283
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,580
so there's a lot of front and worked for
web developers to do

284
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,320
there will be a lot of localization of
course there will be a lot of views

285
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,280
attesting

286
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,070
thats will be more than appreciated on
these devices

287
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,158
and to make this happen Mozilla

288
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,460
is proposing you to I am provide you

289
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,270
a 10-inch tablets which is the reference
device which is being built at the

290
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,908
moment

291
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,520
which in the first prototypes should be
ready I'm quite soon

292
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,820
we can I'll help you technically

293
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,780
a two-alarm rights patches to

294
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,918
from provide shop for feedback should
foreign

295
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,980
use the report saw to help localize

296
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,870
a are strings and help or help identify

297
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,500
wats points should be modified in the UI

298
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,990
the for the localization ans

299
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,629
we r preparing nightly builds to make
sure thats

300
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:12,178
every day you can gets the latest up
tonight's

301
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,909
state of the Arts other projects

302
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,679
so this has been announced by a set of
lower

303
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,270
earlier this month three weeks ago I am

304
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,330
you'll get some news about that's pretty
soon I'll recommend to

305
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,350
check cashed up with another fork in the
next few weeks

306
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,100
and the from everything will be
detailing their

307
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,250
I really hope for would be interesting
this program because

308
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,780
arm Billy Firefox OS has been the

309
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,210
incredible experience but it will be an
awesome experience to work with you guys

310
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,830
on this con- projects are for the next
year that's really my wish

311
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,570
for 2014 and that's it

312
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:01,570
and troubling question

313
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,470
so I'm sure you have some

314
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:14,470
who wants to begin it should be

315
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,500
very nice progress

316
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,710
I'm wondering about the Audio API what
is the latency fought you at the moment

317
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,519
and will you also have a naughty API and
in Marcus

318
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,919
arm I'm not the right person for thats

319
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,779
you know poland in all rights ball

320
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,120
ball somebody gave a microphone to this
guy there

321
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,779
so

322
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,250
the the latency on two devices

323
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,950
is terrible a surround one in
milliseconds

324
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,450
shoot gets a nexus 4

325
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,679
and you're in five associate is
extremely long walks like

326
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,250
for all 20 minutes ago something

327
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,440
%uh interview but or

328
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,409
but that is using the full fledged
whether JK Lloyd

329
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,639
which between develops later today

330
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,840
so this is was for example dinka
pollution

331
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,590
on his birthright insular Christoph so

332
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,240
to me it's good enough if you don't
agree then

333
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,600
you can relieved anyway yeah

334
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,809
the student here there is also a plan to

335
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:39,190
run without you in workers but the specs
not dawn and the code is on top

336
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,260
so just the two countries Justin

337
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,908
contribute yep but there's a plan to do
because there is no way around it

338
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:53,909
should go to uni noble Prince

339
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,360
above when he did not my body to got a
question

340
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,590
why in the marketplace a very simple and

341
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,409
and indication mmm for da Pooky the
license of the OPs

342
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,480
what a lot sorry a

343
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,130
why in their marketplace server isn't an
indication

344
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,760
the license indication perform

345
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,879
the ops all license arm

346
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,000
not no idea its

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,970
yeah I agree it's a been a pity were
when I'm

348
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,820
a big win for improvements on the
marketplace proposal if I'm more worried

349
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,559
about slow startup time

350
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,790
on the marketplace especially China
flaky network so

351
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,040
we have priorities Aug the marketplace

352
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,100
is so I'm not six RK in our team

353
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,309
it's the it's a common project across
desktop and mobile

354
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,030
and the other had their own roadmap a

355
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,660
some I agree it's it's a bit so

356
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,160
bit disappointed for ice floes in for
the AST they feel like it's not the most

357
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,820
important information to put the
following user

358
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,120
and I think I could second that are more
are worried about the permission but I'm

359
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,659
giving it to every app that I install my
phone

360
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,870
I'm I don't care as much as for desktop
app

361
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,120
if it's GPL all profit sorry I really do
care about what he does my data

362
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,300
so on this suspects we've been doing a
good job because we have our webpage

363
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,450
security mobile

364
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,220
which I'm like Android is not asking you
to have

365
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,460
all permissions from the starts before
installing the app

366
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,820
butts ever after ask for permissions as
that requires them so

367
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,340
arm I would say

368
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,750
most of the wall for the average user

369
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,640
I think it's very of much %uh I the
floss into the ass

370
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,640
I agree with you I would really like to
see this of course if you want to see

371
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:06,939
the

372
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,930
some demos all to test some phones there
are some on the booth of cuz ill saws

373
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:13,660
wanna

374
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,290
so are you could ask questions to him of
term

375
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,820
in front of the room another question
you are

376
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:28,820
we have was the one minute okay them

377
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:35,170
in

378
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,990
yeah so what are their biggest search
challenge suis sur developer of iris

379
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,770
Firefox OS are facing all

380
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,240
her

381
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,180
by quite a lot a performance comes to
mind first

382
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,230
a were trying to chew a very low memory
usage

383
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,970
and the to get some quick stop the times

384
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,930
where trying various hacks to improve
the startup times

385
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,290
and I am were investigating

386
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,100
arm a few possibilities a

387
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,620
tomb be able to sandbox panels

388
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,120
and this is also part of the high the
project to be able to sandbox

389
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,419
every panel so this is one of the pics

390
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,910
challengers that's where all going to
address next softball

391
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,170
and this you up arm

392
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,740
I think

393
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,630
another another challenge

394
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,630
well which can be pursued a challenge
for somebody that who is entering this

395
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,200
world

396
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,320
is that we don't have any standard
design pattern

397
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,550
like you could have on JBoss are even on
a

398
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,930
anglo-dutch I S aP's we want to be

399
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,860
as closely as possible on the meat all
so we want to have the best possible

400
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,909
price a

401
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,940
performances so we're not choosing are
standard

402
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,140
am being one of remarks so it

403
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,530
saw I'm inject some yeah

404
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,870
it can be frustrating for all people who
are very jive are rented

405
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,209
it's certain thrilling for our school
like 20

406
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,610
optimize everything but that's another
charge making a our culture

407
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:26,129
are on this proach thank you thank you
so much
