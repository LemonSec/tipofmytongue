1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,909
much and ok maybe we can have a
discussion

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:10,019
it's a topic is this the rise and fall
of open source gaming projects

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,080
and we take a 6.2

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,710
the project we work on battle for
Wesnoth who has not heard from

better for West not is a turn-based
stretchy game

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,899

the home needs to demonstrate a little
bit of the game plan a whole

38
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,080
I'll try to

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,620
a.m. games following the KISS principle
kiss means

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,209
keep it simple and stupid that basically
means

41
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,380
you remove everything a.m. from

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,170
the user interface are from the game a
chain Mission TX

43
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,339
until you have reached 11 a.m.

44
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,380
red barely but yeah nothing

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,530
left to remove so

46
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,360
you can just click units ethelson or

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,980
we're tech as a human's it's nothing
more

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,060
right did I miss anything

49

if a new units

50
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,239
if somebody has don't

51
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,560
are not in no I'm lazy yeah he just
avoided

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,769
society okay

53
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,430
less not is a major project menchu
approaching

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,639
I'm what we have for each 10 years last
you

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,880
and

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,489
settling you during the last to once

57
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,220
you saw power or

58
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,940
form visit us %uh stagnating so we are
not growing anymore

59
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,940
the question is why that's difficult to
answer

60
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,310
them maybe

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,859
from it's because we failed to deliver

62
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,810
this new content content now we are
fully

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,019
content is the most important stuff

64
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,358
for open source games many

65
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,940
open source projects gaming related ones

66
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,430
have problems was content you have
attention

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,020
you have them

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,380
this debut idea of the game ish annex

69
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,290
but only a campaign with three scenarios

70
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,530
if it is campaign based and 2 a.m.

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,138
thats Hafen hour gameplay and cents
finished

72
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm can can you leave

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,870
it's a scenario Keith I just want to
attack

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,430
yeah okay %um attack little him

75
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,590
pimping okay and

76
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,950
must come on you the No okay

77
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,590
said unless it is different we have a
lot of campaigns

78
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,849
17 her eighteen have come many

79
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,919
many good most awesome

80
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,930
are la chanson 10 scenarios so you can
play them

81
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,229
at least two weeks around-the-clock

82
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,460
if you up past include

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,200
earn sets much more certain commercial
many commercially games of all

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,560
for example I'm the last Starcraft comes
with one campaign

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
power 24 scenarios if I remember
correctly

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
I'm that took me two days

87
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,310
to finish on on the easiest difficult
level

88
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,950
and the second that was too easy for me
the next difficult love you

89
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,490
was too hot for me truck wasn't

90
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,470
exactly a the right audience has a game

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,780
okay we are not a burden

92
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,919
to include anymore campaigns into our
game because the last

93
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,849
our pros manager and sets really a
problem

94
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,280
we need a certain quality of

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,500
lot for work trolls a

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,840
story whatever and

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,179
it's hard to reach anymore

98
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,450
the without salt stuff and

99
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,440
stats stuff changes over time because
people lost interest

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,099
or are not at University anymore don't
have time or

101
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,909
Trust I we not sure the last one we have
heat but

102
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,360
it can Josh maybe one of our developer
style

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,470
didn't notice could beat you up could be

104
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,150
happens no chance to tell the

105
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,400
the Henry lever be really um

106
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,520
if they don't then we live how will we
know mmm they would just drop of

107
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,159
inactive

108
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,640
be but we actually made so anymore and

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,830
basically the same which happens if
you're really busy from the time we left

110
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,300
work

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,380
yeah sometimes people just quit basalt

112
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,150
noticing or all are answering anymore to
email it's all

113
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,669
however you tried to contact them yeah

114
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,900
reason to unknown but ok I

115
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,900
you know for yourself I

116
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,120
that you have created something and a
trust

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,229
bro up so every contact button at least
once in your life well

118
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,789
he didn't believe him let's just touch

119
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,909
yeah okay

120
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,990
but all about one of /url

121
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,270
also campaigns we have is some are
collected from

122
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,810
our I don't serve us so they are in fact
made by

123
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,300
users firm which

124
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,909
but hoped to the game and produced

125
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,300
one or a more campaigns we talk some

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,010
if they are fine polish them and include
them in the game

127
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,430
which isn't but possible hurt right now
anymore

128

so him sign up new version of les not

129
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,400

we try to record and other what's not
portable

142
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,970
a game developer you a he said he
doesn't have time for a call that

143
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,660
on it though somebody's a or scenarios

144
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,010
so what he did was owner Jerry Brown

145
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,750
to of a move is genetic algorithm maybe

146
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,360
0 the pic um old

147
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,390
thats aren't

148
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,240
and generate their own stuff well

149
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,270
its can be interesting on game

150
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,060
there your story me

151
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,599
still in the arm

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
normal game you want to have some cum
some campaign with some storyline

153
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,649
evolving

154
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,810
around some characters good or evil and
you want to have something going on

155
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,989
for this you need people who are able to
create scenarios

156
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,540
so the basic setup of each single
scenario

157
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,910
then some overarching concept to make it
a campaign

158
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,149
and who people also able to coded so the
finest

159
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,079
and maintain a doctor watts as you can
see in the ad on server

160
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,939
we have lots of content from users
because make it really easy to produce

161
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,820
new content

162
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,200
and uploaded their been real problem
converting

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
from this new con la pelota their them
first finding the

164
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,069
high quality content and then getting
into mainline

165
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,370
because all the level of maintenance you
have to do

166
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,790
whenever you change something in
mainline he might have to touch this

167
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,360
content

168
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,550
so ventral you just get

169
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:46,550
two large I'm

170
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,800
peace OpenSim and to mention a Yaris air

171
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,670
yeah okay love it pickpocket

172
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,819
says a lot of at once on Sarah M Sarah
over 500

173
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,910
I guess 620

174
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,469
something so it's quite a lot but

175
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,570
says a lot of unfinished on not working

176
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,600
what just them but quality

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,000
or not what's the use all wants to play

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,100
hmm okay

179
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,260
yet he was open source developers should
be confident saying those words numbers

180
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,839
me he picked not

181
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,170
no I'm how do your

182
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,269
find quality content or discriminate
quality content from non quality content

183
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:44,360
on such simple you card from I'm

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,839
was integrating with the

185
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,290
that the problem you you can a.m.

186
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,849
sarge by side miss you

187
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,399
my aunt be a side of quality

188
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,260
how do you get news yeah might be a sign
of quality

189
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,329
the process much using I mean Parkins

190
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,149
there but yeah him

191
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,569
it also might might be just a a
collection of

192
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:15,719
stuff sent base though since

193
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,500
if a you can also sought by totals

194
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,510
so if you don't know it

195
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,149
someone with some most downloads it gets
more downloads

196
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,290
saudis and empowering

197
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,339
system and mostly

198
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:36,730
supposed although it's not just thinks
this fancy names

199
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,170
for which one so once said got first

200
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,880
happens and 17 above the open a new one
for you

201
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,910
the a rating system

202
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,529
would be a solution cool was sentenced
yeah

203
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,769
do you have any experience with reading
systems are doing

204
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:03,769
are you a game developer a game soap

205
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,730
other BP stock louder so you'll be fine
some

206
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,690
way LittleBigPlanet up on

207
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,519
hello crop

208
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,640
in nineteen system some

209
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,240
hope

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,720
and cells

211
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,930
mmm it's not set easy to

212
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,930
establish a rating system but mostly

213
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,180
all concerns are said it leads to worm

214
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,609
yeah that competition might spoil all of

215
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,270
Troy friendly community yeah that some

216
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,210
the reason anthem I think we you will
need to or

217
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,810
get to a rating system sooner or later
yep

218
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,290
just to to make sure that some at on am

219
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,670
server is still use boom are usable
again

220
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm but term

221
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,390
yeah old habits and all drawers hmm

222
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,540
are changing slowly in large open source
projects

223
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,969
especially if you don't have a dictator
yeah so I like

224
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,320
to advice you keep your dictator happy

225
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,370
so 13 lbs yeah our detailed I left

226
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,270
and in to become find new law in our
country a new one account agree that we

227
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,910
need to

228
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,030
dictator yeah you always have stuff

229
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,329
well I guess a basic problem

230
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,930
often face when implementing rating
system if you upload finish content

231
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,260
it's good but if you upload
interactively

232
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,090
like buttons also acutely is done yup a
little early version

233
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,260
someone downloaded sees but doesn't work

234
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,800
better rating next on the list that
doesn't work that rating

235
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,140
then you have some boats you have a very
low waiting

236
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,480
company working what do you do do you
discard all the old Commons

237
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,410
or do you keep them without your real
chance for improving

238
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,800
on nation to like he

239
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,050
about you in any

240
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,189
like late values

241
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,570
ready rating pain a year ago

242
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,620
it might be a valuable ap

243
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,440
yes for problems with we have not

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
tried out we are still in the face of
'em fighting against each

245
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,230
us a if you really want to read to them
couldn't help it

246
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,240
if one what about maybe

247
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,680
it in the channel a it show conned into

248
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,859
yet 1 a group called that you dole

249
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,810
pic from the core developer yes the %uh
structure that yeah I accepted

250
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,310
Melissa yeah know they are actually good
quite proper

251
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,369
I like Google

252
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,450
edition on the anybody can upload lately
I get that way

253
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,870
home yes I promised that ended ended in
a flame war of course

254
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,220
yeah I think it's a good idea

255
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,920
picking him his neck

256
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,810
%uh the most a you

257

things I have and reading

273
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,800
game reversible vision personal

274
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,889
people then the a to provide

275
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,330
the comp so me user as

276
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,449
rarely would see it into a processing

277
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,850
13 I'm well with open source in general

278
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,020
through past to be different you expect
assistant to rise

279
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,760
overtime my humor K months to pay

280
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,300
prop yeah indeed however recently

281
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,129
a games like Minecraft the and so on
have managed to

282
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,770
like the sOooo through process with
development with I

283
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,060
my suggestion actions since me

284
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,270
how beat the Browns so talk to the
people

285
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,080
this industry tassel iraq yes just got
caught up we haven't

286
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,010
you have a bait up branch course I also
the top

287
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,590
you try operating system time other
stuff which

288
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,870
was says yeah I'm backup

289
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,010
its stable engine want years

290
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,570
notes from well what's

291
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,000
based upon and you action

292
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,960
lame see yeah thing

293
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,679
it is thing branch and pay

294
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,100
development pushes through this pizza or
whatever

295
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,449
yeah from commitment and moment

296
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,490
my point is beautiful perspective to
develop

297
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,470
used so think so curious to see what
happens with you

298
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,020
with power SMC group and

299
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,429
is stable you house public

300
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:14,640
months

301
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,480
major them about home star like dumb

302
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,580
see back it's certainly not we have a
very strong multi-player community

303
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,919
and we make sure that our stable
releases a competent with each other

304
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,520
so one stable series every minor bugfix
release

305
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,139
what's a compatible with the other while
in the development really is because

306
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,870
we're doing some crazy stuff sometimes

307
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,340
they are incompatible so the players
just see

308
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,909
okay when I go to the multiplayer server
how many people will find their

309
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,780
for finding a place

310
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,110
now I have crossed I want to continue

311
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,750
as you can see here

312
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,580
160 another games players right now on a
Saturday afternoon

313
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,990
and they're even 32

314
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,040
ok 831 guys come hang around just in the
lobby

315
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,760
waiting to start games or stuff like
this whatever

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,730
talk just talking so the matter is now

317
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,390
if you come on the development server
and only see two guys around

318
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,130
and that's if you're lucky those guys
who want to play multiplayer

319
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,000
will not be there and if you have no one
there

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,620
the which a circle stocks you can
promote this one

321
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,620
I think he was first loud up

322
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:47,510
much not often result beloved

323
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,960

no internet so no many had it on

340
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,050
we had a lot of data yet but nobody we
made use of the data

341
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,360
because it was just too much information
to go through yeah

342
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,360
data mining is not too easy touch

would be a way

373
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,980
rebel for but I'm not that I was the
test this

374
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,730
three years ago record every let me
check if we cancel finders

375
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,549
but I think it's gone but it a.m. it
wasn't easy to

376
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,039
to say quiet why did people quipped

377
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,240
that scenario 5 trust from

378
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,799
this is the testing or no longer there
why

379
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,370
the go insane also said gordon says
scenario

380
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,158
am it was difficult for me

381
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,780
but Yahoo I just used to put developing

382
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,559
pay maybe it can be used for

383
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,158
a yeah pretty add-ons better said for
development minute to try out

384
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,330
yeah a physician truck yeah the middle
so next mickey I i would tell you

385
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,149
pppp passion for you right now

386
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,280
really recognition issues to

387
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,789
carpentry week a forum titled

388
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:24,169
YUM our condo our content creators

389
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:29,530
the main exchange platform is our forum
in the forum we have some titles

390
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,460
of course every developer gets a title
translators get a title

391
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,780
artists get a title and those who are
known

392
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,870
to create good content good title and
those who are known to create

393
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,219
in normative content get a different
idea to get so

394
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,059
we'd use the system especially since the
forums on the Main Place

395
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,158
to complain about content which doesn't
work yeah it's a

396
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,299
serve most the balloon in

397
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,429
who was b what is the yup positive
comments and form

398
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:03,120
and yeah not very much

399
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,520
and maybe a high download rate but

400
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,710
yeah you can't refuse the dow not
counter

401
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,419
like like just the like i cum explained
before

402
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:17,330
and yeah this may not only one I'm

403
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,049
UMC in you submit content inside out the
head turned

404
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:24,710
going to rage yeah

405
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,059
mom kiss I nice neat more

406
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,360
we bought that's definitely the case

407
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,240
is p

408
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,110
so I want to come back to the point we
are just said on that

409
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,059
you need to basically four board I have
gone through in US not

410
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:49,168
versions is that many

411
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:52,250
yes yes yes the very great show stopper
for

412
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,799
place because as: for use

413
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,200
12 tryout perhaps very old

414
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,750
Adams have been reviewed in any way so
if you compare it with other games

415
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,130
for example the very obvious do

416
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,940
you can still play maps need in 1994
because

417
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,179
all the versions are supported through
Anders no

418
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,000
for plotting needed um grappling 16

419
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,570
on what we do have is we do have
different it on so what's the difference

420
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,149
wasn't

421
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:28,189
so we have 18 on some up for the old one
point six series

422
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,140
we have an at home so for the a 1.8
series we have a different one for the

423
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,440
11 Sep 10 series

424
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,809
don't but the basic not anymore okay
it's mom the six years ago so

425
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:42,100
you have a small anti fatigue Klein
front-runner right now bean

426
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,408
can you nope they were confident that
can run

427
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:48,909
almost all no of yeah and hence that
song

428
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:52,450
the experience we're updating stuff
going on that's

429
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,710
week our people forms about or content

430
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,880
and for and problems or homes

431
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,370
the matters if we kept the backwards
compatibility all the time

432
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,809
we will just should also select hasn't
been a problem

433
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:14,970
whole games it depends on how well we
find you engineers

434
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,179
and basically what we are developing
these days is the engine and since the

435
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,899
engines of changing all the time

436
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,939
and we don't have a one single fixed

437
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,090
for most apollo everything should be
it's not as easy

438
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,290
especially since we also say that our
core content

439
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,340
which can also change if you know stable
release

440
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,559
little stale API so to say core content

441
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,000
they are also being the units with the
unit ima just so frewer if you reference

442
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,690
10 those

443
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,820
from the core group it's perfectly
working in this

444
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,270
release in a statement series for
example but we do not guarantee

445
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,690
that we don't for example change the
mission Ave unit meaning that the frame

446
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,840
you will then see

447
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,168
if you are looking at frame 5 is not a
complete different one so

448
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,350
continuing the condom I loled but it
might not look

449
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,949
like the design intended to author

450
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:20,950
like content

451
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,390
usual on out mind

452
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,690
another live you K other

453
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,400
people what get

454
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,640
no yes there are plenty of players

455
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,700
election call and you any robbed

456
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,800
more making

457
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,490
way at all

458
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,270
morning pre-selection

459
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,470
possible increase the for

460
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,210
actually yes 5

461
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,200
lia's possible use to test

462
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,380
those version something like that Playaz
want to review stuff

463
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,480
yet just denying it was the toilet with
that we don't want to encourage

464
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,740
competition

465
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,100
yeah he plays Lowcountry you

466
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,530
themselves and will return they my team

467
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:24,120
yeah no and more

468
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,129
shadows competition get

469
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,480
his go fishin

470
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,950
um vision competition is strides

471
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,200
kids this optician up yeah anti-theft
outside

472
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,250
sup

473
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,450
from so the main point which is CS
unhealthy competition

474
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,690
often ojeda what's because leaderboards
of me to flame balls and stuff like this

475
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,220
so that's why we say we do often

476
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,780
that's why we say in our multiplayer
community

477
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,330
we do not support an official ranking
little something like this:

478
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,889
if you do want to do some drinking you
can do so but we will not officially

479
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,570
supported

480
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,580
within the game itself ya cerraron

481
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,290
let our game ass Who Am yeah

482
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,700
have some chest like its it's called

483
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,130
in law yeah in the ratings saying about
3 a.m.

484
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,390
we don't give some any support and point
was for your sons and because they do

485
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,550
this isn't it since we don't do this

486
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,300
we just ignore it know if there are you
think people

487
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,669
but OK yeah UPPP

488
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,320
Hughes be right players

489
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,889
and then palm different

490
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,800
that him killing

491
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,080
you players you something good play

492
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,669

stay yeah it's not but plate

494
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,330
play yeah I'm

495
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,850
idea is that term content creators

496
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,030
don't head each other anymore if there
is too much competition

497
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,860
but I don't shares that ICSI I'm
completely agree that

498
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,100
and there's health dept unhealthy
competition but im

499
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,990
num a large project

500
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,350
takes a lot of time to change

501
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,919
a week rules yeah and its an engine
rules that you don't like to encourage

502
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,950
competition

503
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,090
pp at and relax a dictator success

543
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,290
good

544

545
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,940
to the the FB world

546
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,300
yeah in you are right them

547
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,460
commercially games what to say

548
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,460
the new game so you have to pot to our
part 3

549
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,820
we don't need to 'em who leads the park
to look past three

550
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,870
you can trust and incrementally at new
stuff

551
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,580
up but the problem is everything you

552
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,350
is always causing resistance CS always
at least

553
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,390
want develop of well once to help avert

554
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,180
at it says oh no my popular ap

555
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,660
so everything you as always

556
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,009
it a huge fight many yeah

557
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,990
don't dictate up um that's a problem you
all we're talking about open source

558
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,629
projects

559
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,460
everyone working on such projects has
their own motivation to do so

560
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,010
no matter if it's a game even some of
issued or

561
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,470
if it's a web browser or just some
commodification

562
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,290
the mattress if you have a project which
is

563
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,290
of some size and some H

564
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,130
you will have several old developers and
their

565
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,130
of course think have contributed so much

566
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,870
what I say is so the golden rule book

567
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,450
you know SFS he won't get around it

568
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,649
so it will be difficult for new
developers to really get hurt

569
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,590
and get there at New end of a great
ideas we implement

570
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,260
that's why fobby says you need a
dictator

571
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,550
you need to tell you need some shit this

572
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,550
celo unit held

573
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:13,359
can make them %um don't you

574
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,558
ruling him nope

575
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,839
um I think if I want to say is

576
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,470
what else most is to have someone else
handle the project

577
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,910
who is one strong my not

578
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,618
but you can also listen

579
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,059
and who doesn't say okay we have always
done it this way so we need to continue

580
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:36,849
this way

581
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:40,150
must be so doubled its site

582
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,290

Elizabeth for the day

622
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,579
for developers or people want to do that
they yeah I with me

623
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,280
whether to or no question what is the
difference

624
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,470
between West local one and what's not to

625
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,618
it was look at what what would be in a
theoretical idea

626
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,990
what would be the difference I think
deep down 88 wealthy

627
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,000
is a big butt it yet he is a UK

628
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,849
so people I would say yeah okay to get
that high the yes you're gay

629
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,849
you get to see ya from now on you're
going to

630
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:40,910
he's got the whole the waged we love it
as a very sharp

631
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,140
you a thought I

632
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,970
the IAAF later and we're going to have
that the

633
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,140
we do it then I all the good days or

634
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,549
try to do this you will wake up I

635
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,569
the Korean I but somewhere

636
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:02,490
date yeah no no all not that's basically
what we're doing with every new stable

637
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,029
release

638
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,790
yeah we just may it not naming in West
LAF to West Mall 3 US mobile 415

639
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,619
and we're still and we're still keeping
the old condom there and updating it

640
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,950
the merits what commercial games do
their is

641
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,359
they have all campaigns they just drop
them they no longer there

642
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,390
and you get the new release which
doesn't have the old campaigns put some

643
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,400
new ones and staff what we are doing
instead is

644
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,030
if we have some new content for example
we edit in addition to the existing

645
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,190
stuff yeah I

646
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,440
gory you don't want to support all good
