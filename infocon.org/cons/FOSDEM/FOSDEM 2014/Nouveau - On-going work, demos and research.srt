1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,439
so um today we'll be talking about
Nouveau

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,550
and the a recap of what the work that
has been done

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,340
what we are doing and what well planning
on doing so today on the stage

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,690
the I'm Martin parece this is emil

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,130
a pic of and Martin aka sneaky a

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,240
we were supposed to have martin line
caused so

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,320
free Martin's a

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,960
but yeah is not here so okay

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,760
soda reason for this talk is last time
we discussed about

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,960
the updates on Nouveau was that pose
them 2012 12 I'm

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,140
we've done another one that XTC but it's
not by themselves

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,020
it's with here too the and of course
there were many improvements and then so

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,379
yet and with that

14
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,640
so diploma

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,100
a new family of God's I so after for me

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,710
and you're really kept not kept Nizam
very put fish in 10 past them

17
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,169
it was released the in March 2012

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,710
and we actually got much sitting support
on the same day

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,050
so the reason why you manage to do that
is because a

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,050
and a oh %um actually sent a katsu Ben
Skeggs

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,910
in advance so you had the car for 15
days to prepare

22
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,869
for down same-day release and then

23
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,970
a there was some a and released 3d
supports

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,509
weapon what that happened a few days
after

25
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,429
but as we were in the middle of
rewriting the miss a driver

26
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:44,569
with the newly trm then he took about a
month

27
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:51,569
I know the for it to be released and
accessible to everyone so

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,580
I the rest of the talk is divided in
kono

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,789
use a space and then the tools we
develop so we'll talk about the kennel

30
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,920
so

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,599
big update Newbill left staging so it's
now supposed to be stable

32
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,920
we try to the

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,689
we also a

34
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,379
rewrote the internal Architektur up the
driver it used to be

35
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,260
I cipla code who used to work you know
not kept up with him a code used to work

36
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,390
all summer

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,950
I code for return for their tnt2

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,439
so we had problems sometimes was
regression

39
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,189
by fixing a cheap set we would just a
special yours is

40
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,810
so the new

41
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,099
koike Arctic Tern is now separated in
Upper chipset

42
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,238
it's very %um it's easier to know
wideout

43
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,670
dependencies on I'm and it helps with
the

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,280
regressions or it should help it's a
object-oriented

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,590
so it really helps for keeping track of

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,340
who is using the the engines and this is
going to be very interesting for power

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,639
power management spines dance from
cutting the power of the engines that

48
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,489
are not used

49
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,689
up to just to be impossible on

50
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,209
okay next thing optimise a

51
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,389
and prime supports I'm so optimises the
technology developed by and media

52
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,379
I'm they use an Intel a GP you

53
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,638
I am and then and then video card so
usually

54
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,680
it's the AM Intel chip you doing the
hold up

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,370
the display and that to the acceleration

56
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,479
well and 32 but whenever you want to

57
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,099
lends a game to get performance than you
use the Indian driver

58
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,500
so you get a low power consumption when
you're doing I'm

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,859
browsing and all that and when you wanna
game then you have to performance

60
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,319
that is available without the power
consumption it

61
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,689
so though the work for that

62
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,900
has been added to Linux 3.0 9 by Dave
early

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,299
and we are still waiting on the
synchronization between the drivers so

64
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,299
it means that if you use one driver to
the rendering and one driver to do that

65
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,329
arm

66
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,709
the bleating are sending stuff to the
screen then you'll see some tearing

67
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,970
because that the two drivers are not
synchronized

68
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,370
it's not gonna tear but it's going to be
choppy

69
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,789
yeah so if you want to have more
information you can have a look at the

70
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:24,450
Weeki

71
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,719
on the wiki page and up to this so power
management

72
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,020
thermal management a

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,580
should be working on almost every card
no

74
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,370
so it means temperature monitoring I'll

75
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,849
there are so many ways of their way be
used to be so many ways to get the

76
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,900
temperature on the card

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:51,010
I it its its grazing especially in
ninety four seven cards

78
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,570
where we didn't well not even sure that
it actually works well

79
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,669
I'm we had a book The someone
complaining about the

80
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,389
the temperature being three thousand
degrees so obviously it's not working

81
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:02,860
well

82
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,710
on every card yeah that's no its not
possible

83
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,239
on so on

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,789
g-force 8 and late on it was far

85
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,440
every call except the one with a i
squared to

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,719
ice quest the on the temperature probes

87
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,039
so the reasons why we cannot get this
temperature and the driver is because

88
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,610
out the HW month Architektur which is
some

89
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,909
used to export all program that's the
truth I am that the driver for the

90
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,270
temperature probe but it only exposes
the temperature to

91
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,969
the userspace to the kennel space can
accuse the information we've been trying

92
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,770
to change that for a while

93
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,180
when I say I want several years and

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,690
I'm so far yeah nothing has changed even

95
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,870
proposed a lot of good their for
management

96
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,310
a static by men the fund management for
test them

97
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,500
the GeForce 82 for me so cheap force

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,839
400 it was added in the limits 3.7

99
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,219
and wat I min

100
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,380
and a couple was fixed sharp

101
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,320
yeah there were some glitches her it was
during the st. period so

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,719
object then hopefully no one so that
when users

103
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,830
the we added a experimental up and
management in 3.9

104
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,000
and it's now in able by default from
three to thirteen

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,380
but it doesn't work an OK place in

106
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,789
so lawyer that's problematic we did

107
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,260
they added a new way to drive a fun and
they've been very inventive nine ways of

108
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,289
trading the final reading temperature

109
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,849
and there is a new way that we don't
support it and we need to understand how

110
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:50,490
it works

111
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,029
but I've been bashing my head on my
keyboard for while

112
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:58,029
to understand that so if you have any
problem with that

113
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:01,810
thermal management fund management you
can contact me I'm

114
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,849
yeah so let's continue on par management

115
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,370
we talking you've been hearing about
this for a while

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,140
a on every foreign for in exile to go
about Nouveau

117
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,820
Michael complains about lack of proper
repacking

118
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,810
so for those who don't know what this is
it changing the frequency of the

119
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,990
up the engines of the I'm graphic arts
it means changing the voltage to

120
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,029
changing the memory timings changing
everything

121
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,630
so this is very difficult to to do
especially when you don't have a

122
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,050
programming guide

123
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,310
so we do that by reverse-engineering a

124
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,409
it should provide a lot of performance
when you need it

125
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,370
and you can know what the the clock when
you don't need it so you all can save

126
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,959
power

127
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,370
by default some for me on

128
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,909
the the clock on the at the lowest so
basically a tenth

129
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,620
of what you would get for down high
performance mode

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,870
so you get a temp

131
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,560
yeah so quite a performance hit

132
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,390
then power & Co gatinho ways to lower
the power consumption without

133
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,450
eating I'm are slowing down downed

134
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,529
the engine it's very good but we don't
have support for that yet

135
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,320
it's mostly done by the hardware but now
I'm we need to set up

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,979
all the registers for that and we don't
really know the the list up registers

137
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,779
and what we should

138
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,349
put seems like in video is just putting

139
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,260
numbers and then there's no logic in it
so will try to

140
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,179
to use that then if our uses complain
too much then

141
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,380
means that it doesn't work because
that's the only way we can test

142
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,420
a mmm so yeah it should be released soon
for family in Kaplan be cuz

143
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,750
so from some code that has been released
for

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,980
dirty ground a k1 so they basically you
know

145
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,149
we know whether to abolish the all the
registers and the value we should but

146
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,339
we are gonna sec if it's our

147
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,230
what needs to be put for the desktop
cards and

148
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,579
if it works and and get but at least we
have a register list

149
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,760
which is good because I found a third up
this list

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,630
on the 3rd and I was wondering why I
didn't have the same power consumption

151
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,860
okay performance and power monitoring I
am

152
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,820
throughout the big thing is that some
Kepler actually have a power since an

153
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,389
hour

154
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,339
so they used to have I am

155
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,790
a Nintendo hardware mother love the card
and I was some

156
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,579
so basically put sec what part of the
engine is active

157
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,599
and then if you assign the a weight on
that and you integrate and you do all

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,670
this stuff in harbor

159
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,219
get the power consumption reading and
you get it about

160
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,380
500 the thousand times per second which
is

161
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,260
but nice poke poke upbeat but we won't
talk about that

162
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,339
um we also we should soon I have a rough

163
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,540
engine uses indication so far memory

164
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,550
are graph is the graphic engine and
video

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,649
oh yeah video decoding and engines

166
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,680
and that's gonna be used for dynamically
clocking

167
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,120
so when we need performance we can
increase the crux

168
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,540
okay so we'll move to the userspace

169
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,589
performance counters its a bit like at
the

170
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,680
a engine use the John indication but
it's not much more accurate

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,089
so we added support for mp3
multiprocessor counters

172
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,410
let's put it this way its TPG PU the

173
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,860
well which boat that for Japan CPU and

174
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,100
right now it's only expose through the
gallium HDD so it's basically graphs

175
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,569
a displayed on top of applications

176
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,469
a and so the capital Port was added by
Christopher Miller

177
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,740
our main kind got %um developer

178
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,209
and the family support was added by
someone picked by the

179
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,489
I'm was my G substitute in this year

180
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,509
he also fixed the cap to support for the
other cuts that talented

181
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,709
so work in progress a

182
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,878
we still have to reverse engineer all
the graphics related signals

183
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,790
and unfortunately we need Windows seven
for that

184
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,029
yes yet w7 who so

185
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,249
on Windows seven we had to Portela tools
to Windows 7 size we can do the reverse

186
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,790
engineering

187
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,649
the so it takes a lot of time but is
still working on it so this is good

188
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:44,779
the and then there are the performance
monitoring for

189
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,930
peed in the ad that was the use it sound

190
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,089
indicator that down I said the should
write shortly

191
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,600
okay another on the way export the
kennel maybe it's just the

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,649
compete there a

193
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:03,120
okay and so this was supposed to be
presented by martin

194
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,639
but since is not here and being a mic

195
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,670
so the at talked about the Terran

196
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,969
to their lives here and re-write I when
I talked about the cap to support that

197
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,959
took some time to actually yeah

198
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,979
and reach and users

199
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,050
so the first mean we needed was the new

200
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,430
Lee JR M was to expose the graphic
drivers

201
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,989
a address in the between memory

202
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,660
so this is very important for GP GP you
without that

203
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,219
we can do GDP now we can

204
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,529
we also support multiple thread so
multiple application per

205
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,329
artwork and text on the card because new
values is another context and I've been

206
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,059
doing so for a while

207
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,819
so it means that when it crashed when it
crashes than done

208
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,889
the whole that stuff crashes

209
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,589
basically but the on but we gain a lot
of performance out of it

210
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,430
so yeah and security

211
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,620
so the

212
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,380
relocation mechanism has been re
reworked I didn't work on that

213
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,589
and I couldn't get information what it
meant people forgot

214
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,660
already the some a lot of users actually

215
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,400
I reported the no space era so that
means that TCM couldn't find

216
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,189
a space to put the buffer a with this
new API

217
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,420
the it it reduces that

218
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,189
a lot so now I don't think that but
reports in that anymore

219
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,580
long or

220
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,270
yeah when you have no memory of course
you cannot have a very

221
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:46,630
being when people want dry bob is going
people want to price some

222
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,150
can occur 1020 PU roughly resolution

223
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,500
22 just doesn't work it doesn't have
enough members so

224
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,930
but get that's to be expected and of
course

225
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,849
we can't do anything about this just
sorry but the race

226
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,860
so from then sin three-year renewal

227
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,589
rewrote the DRM we needed to rear a
rewrite the

228
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,970
miss a driver's so it was a good thing
actually because some

229
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,480
the a and VFX driver got rewritten

230
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,560
this was a mess it's a it's the driver
for G four six and seven

231
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,900
and 50 K so five 6&7

232
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,510
it used to be a well it used to run open

233
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,880
arena and the that's about it so

234
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,900
from Ben Skeggs worked a lot on that and
he changed the name

235
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,560
phone and B 30 to fit and then your

236
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,380
okay so before that

237
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,970
what's called an e30 then and you effect
and then but twenty thirty I didn't know

238
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,330
that

239
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,800
continue a

240
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,079
so you're now it works much better it's
not perfect but it works much better

241
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,339
and the naming scheme is better because
we are have D&D 50 and c0 drivers

242
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,720
so thirty just fits nicely compared to
end the effects

243
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,050
a okay that's it

244
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,109
video decoding was a big new feature

245
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,750
I I did buy a Martin and cost not here

246
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,740
fortunately a so you yet had the support
for found me and Kepler

247
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,810
what I mean it's the same thing so
basically the same thing so it didn't up

248
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,939
look to to to do but each used to rely
on

249
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,220
a well it relies a lot on now of him was

250
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,390
so video decoding is done on the
hardware

251
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,420
see need to send that kodak's to the
card so as it can be codes

252
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,579
and and push to everything on the screen

253
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,750
so the skin whereas a proprietary we use
the Invidia

254
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,470
and Canwest and we used to

255
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,900
ask user to extract these p.m. where's
from

256
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,630
amor and my a trace amor and the and
Maya traces

257
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,120
looking what is going on on the PCI
Express bus

258
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,690
or what the drivers doing so every
interaction as with the

259
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,140
the card weekend law gets and from that
we can

260
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,449
recreate the the film was so

261
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,310
needless to say it Sep pain to

262
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,589
to do that phone users but the reasons
why we didn't

263
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,860
shape the the film was was because it's
so

264
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,990
well we are not allowed to read it there
a redistribute them

265
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,529
legal problems so too a overcome that

266
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,320
%um Jochen actually wrote a a script to
extract the film was from

267
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,970
the proprietary driver so you just need
to

268
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,089
I download it no need to install it

269
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,320
it will extract though the film was from
the what we call the blob

270
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,040
and then on you can just use the pillars

271
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,790
so it's very easy on Arch Linux we have
a I'm a package for that

272
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,219
it's very simple it takes while the time
up downloading

273
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,000
and then you have the families so it's
very simple I don't know for other

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,640
distros

275
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,760
get into as one in the pipes are

276
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,250
okay yeah I don't know for Debbie and
then the

277
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,250
go into how they are going to to do that

278
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,470
of Federer but I mean there we did our
best

279
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,910
and we as we don't have legal counsel
and all that or maybe we can just ask

280
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,679
India now

281
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,480
if they want to allow us to redistribute
that families

282
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,140
who knows so

283
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,250
a so really I hope on that

284
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,419
on this crypt where is it up but he also
courted the support

285
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,620
farm 2050 surge apostate

286
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,530
so now we have a video decoding support
for from 94 8

287
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,530
to the latest downloads so that's

288
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,379
for support so for H the 264

289
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,210
and had 12 and I'll another one with the
C-one

290
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,460
yeah that

291
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,970
basically recalled at suppose for
celebration has a

292
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,400
I believe the and VAT for tonight and
the next six which has sparked

293
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,140
show supportable it's their p.m. pay

294
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,679
so yet with p.m. pay you can get them
pick one into acceleration

295
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,860
and it's for and the 42 ND

296
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,290
90s 60 24 7 basically

297
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,550
soldier 47 can have a acceleration but
it it's crap

298
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:36,110
and picture acceleration is not is while

299
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,219
so if you want more information %uh you
can visit the

300
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,929
wiki page video acceleration Sperry in

301
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,090
up-to-date so it will tell you what
driving you need

302
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,260
so what now what you need in the kennel
side Meza

303
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,960
and and a few miles off course and
what's

304
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,690
what the hard to actually supports

305
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,790
kit a Open GL a few days ago I don't
know if she's so the news but we reached

306
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,080
Open GL 3.3 I love for

307
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,418
and the 50 and the c0 so

308
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,750
basically everything after g-force 8
it's going to be in me so tight end up

309
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,750
one

310
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,500
so a story a bit of our support
basically we

311
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,440
the I did open show three support in
mister eight so whenever the Intel

312
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,590
driver

313
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,320
got it to work and we got

314
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,020
open show 3.1 in mister nine apparently
to so

315
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,350
we can't remember if it was 9.9 one so

316
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,658
with a we don't remember that but
basically weeping

317
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,300
a having a good track at the following
the the releases

318
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,190
a Pinto but only for NBC 0 so this is
very interesting because this one as

319
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,810
Andy's

320
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:55,310
50 and c0 at the same time usually chief
of state no one cares about it

321
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,730
it yeah it's getting old so we still
have limited support for GK

322
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,240
so dumb well basically the the two
latest

323
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,240
kept the cards and yeah I can't remember
why

324
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,658
restrictions that may be yeah believe so
believe there's some

325
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:18,290
subtle changes and children a few others

326
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,928
which hasn't been dealt with Tim

327
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,740
oh yeah can use to spank

328
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,660
forgot about it so as I was saying I
believe there is a couple changes in the

329
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,450
ISA

330
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm not you from 0 there's a new I say
which

331
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,280
separately with could become people
added support

332
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,649
yet there were things never buy that
sport so that's why doesn't work

333
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,710
but believe the primitives

334
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,380
just it should work just the more
complex though

335
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,480
she there's yet might take a while

336
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,809
basically you up still compositing
environment and that's it

337
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,418
okay

338
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:04,380
a one less thing soda good thing whizzer
gallium the Galleon frustrate a Nouveau

339
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,120
is that there is that the correlation
between that drivers

340
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,340
and what we call the state rikers so

341
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,918
this a Arctica allows us to

342
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,460
creates a the new are for instance

343
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,910
support for pop OpenGL and then

344
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,870
all the drivers and a I can remember add
support for that and that they don't

345
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,699
need to rewrite everything themselves

346
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,280
so in they've been a new state rucker

347
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,440
a direct3d photo text 9

348
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,970
state rucker it was started by joachim

349
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,110
sin hold I don't know this guy but good

350
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,030
thank you and that it was completed by
Christopher Miller so our

351
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,690
main a developer of miss them so

352
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,799
we manage to run Skyrim service
civilization 5 and the

353
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,040
Starcraft 2 and we can get up to twice
the

354
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,290
that the FPS and wines up direct3d
implementation

355
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,010
so when you to direct3d in the driver
its way faster

356
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,870
get yeah apparently they got better

357
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,639
but I mean wine but I don't know so the
announcement is here

358
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,020
and if you want to compile it are you up
to

359
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,720
the link there are eat me as should be
interesting

360
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,260
a bit and ever tried it so and yeah so

361
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,390
now a hand Mike to just SubRip well on
the

362
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,429
compiling if you want compiled the
branches

363
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:34,919
a rather old you so this should be your

364
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,440
great forty YouTube rebates but

365
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,780
if anyone is struggling a most likely

366
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,250
ok with the note at the end there's a
guy that actually Rapace that then

367
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,720
he did so about go a couple smoker just
along the way so

368
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,720
you see that one shortly yeah

369
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,290
so I wanted to talk about the tools for
dinner with over

370
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm not even the into the arms of the
Taliban developer

371
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,590
we have a set of tools like I'm eggs to

372
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,959
database a male days to go the will

373
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,110
assemblers and the awesomeness for the
ISA's than the

374
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,570
use this on and the appeals to go the

375
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,460
some girls I'm Tsin

376
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,440
they can get up to out because of
towards the end because that's what they

377
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,020
told us

378
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,350
there has been

379
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,860
but if we're going to send to you
present for most we moved to annually

380
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,928
it was during the and it will spin just
because that on

381
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,280
a.m. on get help

382
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,639
on upscale organization course

383
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,450
where the IPL you know visionary did
able to work on it

384
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,220
well too the course problems because

385
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,570
nobody helped the was access to the

386
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,879
rebel because to whose

387
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,600
some people followed that up or and at
the other deposit

388
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,830
so slows I had my and the and other
private one

389
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,570
so this recently it ended up we have
nowhere

390
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,250
new people don't have were between
development has other nights

391
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:25,669
so it's much better that way and North

392
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,370
we doing in the dorms first

393
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,389
who we making documentation for the

394
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,610
and abuse but sixth the

395
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,360
will we'll see ago I think is to those

396
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,139
just plain text the condition of some
bits of

397
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,530
out that we know he well and might be
interesting for

398
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,000
to nuclear miss is stocked with the
Falcon ISA Dokes

399
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,429
for one of the Michael controllers at
that that the cart

400
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,360
I'll slowly working

401
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,629
to make it government move the car

402
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,780
going quite well but

403
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,290
slow the but

404
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,418
the vendors for what themselves to be
mmm

405
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,720
it was nice to ride bus knows that

406
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,210
nice to its so we sent to be moved to
air

407
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,550
new documentation system based on the

408
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,149
the things that mentors the things
accommodation system the same one that

409
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,408
bite on books use us

410
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:33,580
its with things you still had the
condition

411
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,830
in plain text about with a few special
Mike officials

412
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,059
and stings candidates a and that isn't
nice

413
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,139
closely first estimate for me it's so we
can

414
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,720
easy valve seats from the web else then

415
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,610
can just go to that URL and have a look

416
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,719
and a new feature that stinks else us to
do is

417
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,640
and budding the biggest influences the
writing the

418
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,909
mentation I wondered if it was a beatles
has been on waste the

419
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,510
think so database its season tix in
except

420
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,760
XML and contains at least every

421
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,010
it is that we know on and you get
reviews

422
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,710
issues for several purposes it use to
going to rate had this fall

423
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,850
the other divers who with their eggs
that assists and

424
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,428
value sold them issues too

425
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:35,770
pickled in the mail places but at all
its fuels

426
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,668
its can also be used for syndrome lookup
oppose this

427
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,840
don't know if that is that this really
experience

428
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,770
the picture is mentioned twice into and
because the bow ones and the

429
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,389
maximo database and once in the
documentation

430
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,820
so we are now I think support for

431
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,658
new special note mark up to tools being
so that we can just

432
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,600
this kinda register in that went through
the condition and

433
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,600
it's going to gonna read the XML to that

434
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,920
and other the told it was made for

435
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,810
the no voice the Falcons the compiler
the falcone

436
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,110
is the kind of my cover Michael this is
a matter in the end of the interview

437
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,419
it's used for many purposes including to

438
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,520
video decoding including graphics
context switching so we can on

439
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,610
web application more than one for the
application to us if used book power in

440
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,360
their hands

441
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,949
so

442
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,100
searching for a couple

443
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,199
the made the sickened by the for the for
the

444
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,730
the ISA so that we can the

445
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,990
live there michael goldfarb avoiding see
the Dove

446
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,120
doing it in the summer like now its

447
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,159
because is been you worked on the
assembly and disassembly affirm

448
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,890
this so we just needed a compiler for
that yeah

449
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,180
its

450
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,830
that how it works only for the pick-up
but we're so only that

451
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,840
context which in fact we're both with a
bit of work it should be

452
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,139
use them to support anyone's

453
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,680
the which is the our management Angie

454
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,560
and if you want to repeat about it

455
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,850
yes thanks and

456
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,070
home the most recent 2 the

457
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,590
to compile busy cleaning

458
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,620
to the house along the

459
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,189
like a person's on the and we don't
abuse work we

460
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,700
have to look at the famous for that them
when we don't like to compare things

461
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,360
because

462
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,780
its was getting too hard

463
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,180
its a lot of work to the compiler
something and again spent like

464
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,410
weeks just pacing some functions what
goes wild

465
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,140
whilst the papal distractions is going
to release

466
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,890
is the sloops local figure out cold how
the world works by the combination

467
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,190
the both its

468
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,040
my muse my own place as we just the use
on

469
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,350
and communication between there that I
but in the cart on the

470
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,770
PCI Express bus but when the

471
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,100
the a piece of companies controlled by
the Michael going to live right on the

472
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,530
cart

473
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,100
you can just listen to what its what is
doing because does not easy

474
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:39,060
access complete so we have to just a
difference and to compile them store

475
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,040
know what's going on the process has
been done by hand

476
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,860
but I love buying both thats really
inefficient

477
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,179
so the like this

478
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,510
physicists the think use

479
00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:01,050
the computer for the that gonna ISA own

480
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,550
its men's to they could've the all the

481
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,750
definitive the issues in the compelling

482
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,500
like a goth but now it's works its

483
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,840
quite well for some appears on my Google
he doesn't yet support the

484
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,800
for Falcon i say bout it's enough to him
to

485
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,460
to go michael gold its

486
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,470
is suing the quiet the actually
architecture in a min away so

487
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,930
it can be clue to support any the ASA

488
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:40,680
that would have sucked before most of
was the focal and VPP to micro

489
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,240
ISA thats with as well many

490
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,420
controllers used in the video recording
I just begins because both

491
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,720
they exist I say to get going and

492
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
well the results look quite nice on

493
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,160
above the ISA's goth the give it up by
an area

494
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,680
give it some hints where to start
golding and

495
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,710
its be sold the they sleep so tickled

496
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,570
that as normal controls like this Texas

497
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,679
kiss the table so is much easier to lead
and

498
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,290
the assembled at reviews don't its steam

499
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,940
still a public it will be at least so on

500
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,940
mike is working to them them

501
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,720
boo book

502
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,110
you

503
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,020
from okay Brett hope you can hear me

504
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,240
um as said before minutes to know and
I'm gonna

505
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,080
taco but on the community sign so

506
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,879
I'm not sure coming out you are using
you for coming and we are actually

507
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,560
active or not some trying to be active
but you know

508
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,090
iraq has other obligations so arm

509
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,679
for slogan I have a brief about the
Bugzilla cleaning

510
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,230
so if you are aware in new or used to be
a user mode settings driver which

511
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,240
Amanda everything was done in the

512
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,810
the VX switch

513
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:30,260
was on that's rates so the bottom line
is sensed swim moved into the current no

514
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,360
was again a que mas on a driver and if
you look at the Bugzilla

515
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,990
have thousands and thousands of bugs
about the EMS driver

516
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,440
and

517
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,360
in its quite a lot of those or an update
it for years so

518
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,040
in american did remarkable job which

519
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,120
possibly some people hate them for
because all he calls me buck

520
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,060
put so much important at five years ago
and

521
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,740
then messed up just in both are betting
so what he did was he

522
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,040
cleanup up in the box cube Escondida
mass closure bugs which hasn't been

523
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,760
updated

524
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,060
for over the last two years three years
the boats run down significantly as you

525
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,679
can see

526
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,710
I'm but there has been quite a few
boasts

527
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,510
I managed to get solved people actually
set oh yes I am still having the problem

528
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,950
and tweet recent changes in colonel in
everything we can get a bit more

529
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,710
information

530
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,910
or for example where it's crashing what
kind of a problem it s

531
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,020
so yes it is set

532
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,480
there have been quite a few Texas

533
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,760
on that um next thing as

534
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,860
um not sure how me know if you're
familiar

535
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,620
freed us Lopez move there we can system
UAE

536
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,959
and I'm actually it's a good time Gautam

537
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,070
know us more than the spam and

538
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,600
while doing that there has been more
than dozens of

539
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,659
obsolete which art coasts and some

540
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,800
were not that alphabet abate that so
what do you MEA and Martin over there

541
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,390
are dead

542
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,830
was base continue more someday obsolete
while Sen

543
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,259
the road though the color pages the
Bugzilla page

544
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,820
ban

545
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,050
and up on work out very nicely at the
moment

nice big picture and you see okay
weather and look for

548
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,720
get on boats n we make sure we update
the so-called

549
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,709
for I latest version of the software
because as you can see there aren't that

550
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,540
many of us

551
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,920
from it's not that easy to you always

552
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,190
keep on going on back 14 for for example
for means a nine-point something where

553
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:51,240
SPS to people actually doing some work
on it so we always

554
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,899
recommend you try it up the latest
software from

555
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,180
so with that tho clean up a lot of the
crop

556
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,569
there's still something in their belief
but if anyone's skin on doing that

557
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,480
more than welcome to Just hoping to RCC

they will need rights for that vocal

560
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,950
that's the problem with the new with the
system we need on it

561
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,100
you need an account on a protest up
account

562

few dust-up

564
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,290

I so at the pics

581
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,150
the C 2013 they already

582
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,220
mmm

583
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,339
non-disclosure between patient which man

584
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,090
great for us arm

585
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,140
additionally there was a I was at me now
from the media which

586
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,859
going to stay that well one can print
out the box experience from the way

587
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:54,598
users

588
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,250
which is again rates um

589
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,180
our belief or high

590
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,470
and so on significant mmm be some
documentation

591
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,819
which did cover couple by Gary Arsenal

592
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,070
possibly mister a couple more air switch
no warning 610

593
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,800
because of the variety of various
connectors to see

594
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,580
especially docking worse is known that
can set up set set for

595
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,590
listen but the BCB related

596
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,730
the view stables means display connector
box

597
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,580
if I'm not mistaking um additionally

598
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,120
game wanna dunno guys not as that

599
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,060
demoss I weren't working that greatly so

600
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,290
in in vidor kind enough to provide us
with some

601
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,840
information as to you which specific
chipsets need it

602
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,130
to gave swat show same methods

603
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,060
to avoid any issues or having at that
point

604
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,799
and additional very very nice hope

605
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,250
went on some Pune calling because in
american s who was working

606
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,840
a belief on the 20 BP 3

607
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,060
yeah the picture in the Petri it was
happy and the first few seconds

608
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,500
of rendering and coding the recording
was great

609
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,800
the fair was crashing two seconds and
its

610

answers as Martin mention earlier

615
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,610
which from in designing a bell because I
call it looked at 10

616
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,690
are

617

618
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,009
many of the registers are the same

619
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,030
it's that dirty ground a k-1 is based on
the

620
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,590
aka burkhard year for graphics

621
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,200
but still some engines are very similar
or exactly the same we don't know yet

622
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,240
mostly make some both I

623
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,419
and then the so we have the register
dumps

624
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,930
so it means the addresses their name so
the name may be cryptic but

625
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,970
we surely it gives you an idea of what
this is

626
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,419
and then the that the values that should
be stored in them

627
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,440
%uh the default value or what means

628
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,850
everybody at the bit field so it's very
very nice especially for stuff but

629
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,990
you cannot really reverse engineer
engineer easily such as the hardware

630
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,939
models for the park conception of the
card

631
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,000
I wouldn't know that at one

632
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,930
point this is just for the graphic to
the engine and this is for the

633
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,810
three-year engine and all but part of it
so now we can %uh the proper the

634
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,940
conditional on that

635
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,440
which is nice yeah okay

636
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,660
and additionally force yesterday morning

637
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,879
I thought I was still sleeping when I
saw and I see past that

638
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,100
which was great the that we've provides
such to some

639
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,240
me a very small architectural work

640
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,339
on new ball such as: that's a

641
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,540
provide support for non-pc devices in
basically as

642
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,370
a belief America basic support for the
pair came on

643
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,970
device and then from not mistaken for
both equipment up

644
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:31,640
it doesn't providing remote settings

645
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,609
so it's just weren't on display in June

646
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,130
okay so ok.so

647
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,930
if the latter delivering yes so an

648
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:48,129
so yeah basically no you can used
Nouveau to work to

649
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:54,080
as a CRM driver for the to gripe que won
they won't work on the user's peso

650
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,430
to the m3 expiration but if it's really
based on Kepler

651
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,740
it should pretty much work out of the
box was

652
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,229
our troubles so we'll see because we
don't have the hard-won

653
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:11,270
yet but this would be something very
interesting right and if not let and as

654
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,280
I said earlier if

655
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,280
gen yon if anyone's willing to help

656
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,010
or it's got a few moments or if for
example a feeler can know what channel

657
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,360
and you see someone coming up with your
questions just please help out because

658
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,620
dont let me know wassup at a set for

659
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,740
for time now and would be great its

660
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,220
the people just come forward and say oh
for example are very good at programming

661
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,600
and see or for example I'll I love
writing documentation

662
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,310
for example he can help out marching
with pay

663
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,140
people and we are really looking forward
to find

664
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,990
someone interested in compilers because
weeks suck at it

665
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,160
make no oh yes and yeah we need people
for that

666
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,759
and yeah but only in a row well as
willing to go

667
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,210
just come for its I day in the IRC
channel or something you may love

668
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:09,190
either one of us should be rather
straightforward fine if not guess

669
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,630
give us a shout will get sorted

670
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,220
and maybe we can give our nicknames on
IRC

671
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,259
oh yeah minus fun so is

672
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,930
exact though annis and wk

673
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm you poof and a milonga both

674
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,230
yeah I'm

675
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:36,230
bass guitar for thing you very much and
if you have any questions

676
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:52,230
boo

677
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,630
way

678
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,110
sorry I just turned up who's working on
the MBBS I

679
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:09,210
other you would hype or no

680
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:16,210
for Nikon com I'll who is working video
but none

681
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,250
think you misunderstood

682
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,300
envidia now is starting working in
improving Nouveau

683
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,400
yet so del and media in the

684
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,580
engineers a we don't know yet them yet

685
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:36,580
are you don't know yet okay yeah my best
but yeah the keeper it

686
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:51,260
complete we've been clear enough map

687
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:58,420
really me

688
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,990
and this documentation to be released in
2013

689
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,808
how much would you say that the it
covers

690
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,309
I mean but one percent up the PPS

691
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:14,809
no the they explain to BB OS defeat the
RBS which basically

692
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:17,869
describes how to hide this laid out and
if it s push like

693
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:20,950
this ever external display connector or
not

694
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,538
way see this special media box or
something like that

695
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,609
and it's really helpful because a lot of
those configurations we wouldn t know

696
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:29,160
about

697
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,848
so again that support for something you
don't necessarily have ourselves

698
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:39,849
anybody else

699
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,690
and pass the comment the comment Asian
on the BIOS

700
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,760
also come on but how to wear own me

701
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,750
whether recent outbreak you

702
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,840
be giddy when day in relation to buy it
day s push for

703
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,860
yes but next to the old stuff they have
so

704
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,080
they explain new stuff but form that we
can work out all stuff as well in some

705
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,700
cases

706
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,790
make some connector shareware the use in
old guys

707
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,840
in weeks old and that we didn't know
where they weren't necessarily

708
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,330
to now we know it day-in we can add to
put all stuff is for

709
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:29,330
okay assault when I run the

710
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,069
in the water driver is there a chance
that my crepitus heart may break or are

711
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,660
there

712
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,890
at least in theory enough safeguards the

713
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,650
me though it could sell destroy

714
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:46,540
but yeah if don't your I never managed
to

715
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,770
and have been heating my the my cards
was a I

716
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,100
oh what's the word for that her trailer
the

717
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,330
in order for it to your effort to reach
130 degrees to test some

718
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,920
well I didn't know how it worked at the
time but there is a

719
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,740
a dedicated part up the engine working
on

720
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,459
thermal management and then you there
were thresholds and all that for

721
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,170
temperature and I wanted to check

722
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,080
in the viewers where that was the
temperature return and in the hardware

723
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,720
so I had to do stuff like that and tests
everything

724
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,830
and yes I reached even more than that
your and the car never

725
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,850
I mean it still works perfectly so

726
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,160
yeah and is being stupid enough to do
that on the

727
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,149
for me and the it still working I mean

728
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,710
running at gay you're reading games at
130 degrees

729
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,950
does that it s just esta compositing the
sphere

730
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,379
want this could okay

731
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,560
weird a yes so it could in theory
happened but it's unlikely

732
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,490
drinkers but a lot of time ends not none
of them were ok so

733
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,879
sp you a belief

734
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,610
I Martin here has second can be at the
biggest collection of their carts

735
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:06,500
if you go to us page you gonna be just
shocked by

736
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,890
but the pasta month i think im missing
them

737
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,009
overall are a charter that something
like this

738
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,300
and 15 I think over

739
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,690
both and from the long Globes thats

740
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,980
Hilton London value stored there i think
is there some kind of sense

741
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:31,020
none of them were ok so it seems that
they had to destroy accounting software

742
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:36,650
boo well in some cases I did manage to
break it but then if it turned the power

743
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,410
off and then waited for like 30 seconds
for its

744
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,560
define a SUP getting any power than it
would wreck again

745
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,210
so yet it it's a hybrid

746
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,310
David way to get the cat but you get to
keep both pieces

747
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:56,310
anybody else

748
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,509
okay thanks a lot s
