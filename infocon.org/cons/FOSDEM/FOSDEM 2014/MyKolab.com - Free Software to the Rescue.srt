1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,969
the primary school to go to make another
thank you

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,210
so I'd rather talk to my whole lot just
very few

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,360
I few words to beginning about call out
of the technology itself which my call

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,009
out fee

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,539
services based upon so call out is I'm a
group or solution which means

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,310
your email account during address book
task and files

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,900
arm it has a server-side that does the
whole you know

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,360
web interface in fact we are are
supporting the rock your community

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,730
rather actively

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,209
bomb so the interface down for call at
his Tehran to webmail are across

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,370
I modules for the other functions we
have ActiveSync support how the hard and

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,010
wet doubt

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,070
so you can synchronize all sorts of some
devices to it

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,730
in fact all of this was three factors
over the past years we're very happy

15
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,209
last year and force them to essentially
show of the clean stack

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,109
I'm towards the middle of problem last
year we finished the final model

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,530
and arm so this is now the very first
time that we have for for a fact a sec

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,510
on the server side

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,159
call itself is a bit older in fact right
now

20
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,470
it goes back to a 2002 fish

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,030
on when the German Office for
information security which is part of

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,150
the German government

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,880
required a group or solution that they
could

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,229
trust I'm that they could use for their
own in-house purposes

25
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,670
and to them that meant it have to be a
hundred percent for softer

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,970
and it should be as open standards-based

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,929
ass humanly possible and down the result
of that development project that came

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,140
out of this was called up

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,220
which then turned into a big bro call a
solution

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,670
and has been evolving from their club
system switches

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,979
where I am the CEO was started in 2010

32
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,340
and Switzerland and we are now the
primary developer in an open community

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,360
process

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
of the colour technology I'm it is
important to offset hopefully also to

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,810
you with a call at this one hundred
percent for softer

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,049
there is no proprietor component
anywhere

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,110
also not in the Enterprise version
that's also no reliable saying none of

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,110
that stuff going on

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,599
right not and that's important to all of
us have crossed our hearts

40
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,619
saw developed and the collaboration
technology with a strong server side

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,330
also a desktop client that runs on
Windows or Linux

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,959
I'm with a clear focus based on security
normally

43
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,349
traditionally people would install this
at home or in their company

44
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,709
and it would be a run on premise on as
you what

45
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,840
I call that baddest the traditional way
of doing this

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,430
but as we developed call out for you
again and again got people who came to

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,819
us said

48
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,030
I really want to use call out but I'm
not technical enough to set it up or

49
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,310
down

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,910
want to run my own mail server cash you
save me the hassle of doing so

51
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,980
so at some point there was a certain
threshold internally past where we

52
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,640
figured alright if

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,159
we hear that so often maybe people

54
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,310
actually would be willing to use this
and soul for

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,129
cause them last year in fact we launched
my call out arm as a backup so

56
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm across just in time for the last
cost and where we said look guys were

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,120
just set up a server here

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,620
you can just register and it's for now
it's gonna be a

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,610
non-paid service so for free I'm having
beer

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,400
are we will wants to move this to an
actual paid service at some point in

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,250
time because

62
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,390
we thought that there shouldn't be a
demand out there for people who prefer

63
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,909
not to be the product I'm who prefer to
pay

64
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,890
for that kind of service in actual money
and make it a clean transaction where

65
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,089
they know exactly

66
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,120
both ends of the transaction because we
do not know

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,870
part in particular are the economics of
the site when you are data mined

68
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,120
how that works you don't know the price
you're paying really

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,840
and we were convinced some people should
be interested in actually not being data

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,349
mined and would be willing to pay for
that service

71
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,790
so with that let's give it a try we
launched Michael II

72
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,900
and saw a good number of sign-ups of
course as with any reef exhort new

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,299
technology I mean

74
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,190
you know you know how it iz I people
find issues

75
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,959
I am we the property sector resolving of
many of those issues as we possibly

76
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,520
could

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,810
making in that case actual very good to
use our

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,180
the diversity of devices poking up to
the service

79
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,710
and all of that went back into call out

80
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,549
the technology-based is important to
understand that my call up

81
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,470
was the very first major deployment of
that he was stacked are it is run by

82
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,500
ourselves which means we actually get to
diagnose or the issues immediately which

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,320
is very nice

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,599
bomb and everything is developed always
been and for the upstream we had a very

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,300
very strong upstream policy

86
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,740
everything we do for my caller end up in
the upstream

87
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,520
and in the get recourse which everyone
can consume so

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,990
if you want to run your own answer the
best go ahead an hour

89
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,289
be our guest arm you can do this without
a without us

90
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,759
it's your choice arm we give you the
entire stack

91
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,310
you can do it call back

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,560
kinda looked good it started working
farm well we saw a very encouraging for

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,960
state-backed you now

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,258
people stick seem to like it for
eventually we said all right

95
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,039
actually are feeling us there should be

96
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,949
an actual market fear for this so I'm
nice

97
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,380
go away

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,380
so you know we set it up on of course

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,900
com we set it up I'm s best we could to
me this earth

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,799
arm RSS lol I'm test results from a call
us

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,440
so we we really try to do this well
however

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,150
if we wanted to move this to a paid
service which we thought

103
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,030
we should do we figured out that
alternately

104
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,000
well doing it the way we run the backup
was not sustainable because that was a

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,740
single machine

106
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,610
rights in it in a dataset secure no
that's fine but

107
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,080
one machine which means you know your
one-hopper defect away from

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,050
the total service outage which isn't
necessarily what you want

109
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,740
especially when people pay for it they
have a right to demand higher

110
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,979
availability

111
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,710
therefore we figure out all right we
need to make this more sustainable

112
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,250
also that rating means very very little

113
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,830
if you do not control the entire chain
arm

114
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,990
I mean an attacker will not attack your
strongest

115
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,030
spot they will attack your weakest spot
typically they

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,948
rarely ever do you the favor of
attacking where you have built the

117
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,190
gigantic fortress

118
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,750
they try to find the back door farm and
that means for any such service of

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,650
course

120
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,560
that first of all the data center for a
secure that you're using secondly

121
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,660
if you don't have physical control over
the actual hardware that is running the

122
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,729
service

123
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,419
you do not even know what is going on
Fisher just rent out sums

124
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,090
a server somewhere in a data center
where you have no knowledge of West

125
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,520
access physical access to your machine

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,508
you don't really know with that rating
means nothing because they already have

127
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,240
to certificate and a sitting in the
middle of it

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,389
though is that okay we need to do this
with hardware and somewhere in the more

129
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,539
murky regions of our company group

130
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,599
I'm we actually found arm

131
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,440
effect of on US hardware aren't that

132
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,669
was old boats redundant enough

133
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,539
arm so I mean meaning we could lose a
couple of hours and still have enough

134
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,060
power to actually run this

135
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,060
for the number of you this we saw at the
time and we figure

136
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,740
all right let's give this a try so we
know you know not having a press

137
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,539
conference for that day we

138
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,770
loaded into the car bomb and no def not
meant to actually fit that all

139
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,068
arm any the the stop us from review for
you happy

140
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,879
so we have some fun you know carrying it
out of one day to find their carry it

141
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,310
into the other data and/or

142
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,400
setting it all out you know making it
all nicely

143
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,620
arm appetizers stand you know or
remote-controlled

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,740
I your own was sitting here in the
middle as the high I

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,940
the head behind a lot about I'm exactly
that guy who

146
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,199
who also our system architect by the way
they've got actual deep technical

147
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,580
questions

148
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,849
that matter arm

149
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,409
so the he set this up so that

150
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,729
ultimately the physical servers would
behave much in the way that you would

151
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:30,370
expect

152
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,969
virtual servers to are on tour behave

153
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,719
in the sense that they came up you now
they got their IP address they pulled on

154
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,029
the image if they got there

155
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:42,080
provisioning they got the functions that
they should have

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,180
all nicely automated spending up and
down as required

157
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,510
but that was all sweet and dandy we set
that up arm

158
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,500
solidly on a Enterprise Linux back at
the time although I think we've found

159
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,779
also that one

160
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,149
and so you know started to tomb to move
this

161
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,160
into production and

162
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,459
and actually literally were carrying
this back into the other data center

163
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,839
where it was running

164
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,050
for a while arm way and mister slow and
released his revelation it was literally

165
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,859
the same day

166
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,060
arm so effect effectively realized ok
rap arm

167
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,800
we're coming up on our be able to use
that how to for very long our own

168
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,930
to begin with bomb but secondly of
course

169
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,790
we suddenly saw a dramatic spike in
interest so the new the

170
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,370
proposition which we thoughts what
actually

171
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,449
be interesting to people namely run a
service where you're not the products

172
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,779
I'm and gets some you know someone for
not they don't mind you

173
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,699
and actually gave you the best privacy
that can give you

174
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:48,329
bomb suddenly became a whole lot more
appealing to quite a few people

175
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,040
and bomb I mean one thing the totally
took us by surprise

176
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,490
was France's when PJ on decided to

177
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,550
shutdown book law and I'm action on page
a4

178
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,069
quite from your subject working folk
rock along the paths and armpit and I

179
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,790
have been in contact for

180
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,199
a long while and at some point we just
saw this

181
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,630
massive spike in traffic on on the on
the web server

182
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,899
trying to figure out what's going on
before we even knew it

183
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,689
on that machine which was from africa
Drupal instance arm

184
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,740
effectively just went on a memory and a

185
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,500
kill the tough car at which point I'm on
Twitter use all BR

186
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,899
conspiracy theories about the NSA
haven't gotten to us now

187
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,610
on the PJs with us because so ultimately

188
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,759
you know obviously he's now we are the
prime target

189
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,680
are on it wasn't quite so dramatic it
was actually just a web server that

190
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,620
we couldn't scale fast enough sense of
frankly

191
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,180
on that spike really really surprised us
now what we saw

192
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,120
actually bomb and this is the actual

193
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,360
like I I'm at storage space

194
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,559
problem can you spot where that happen
trust me I did

195
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,439
the effect we saw with dramatic I mean
seriously

196
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,219
dramatic arm so

197
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,949
it's been going up aren't quite I'm
strongly

198
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:20,649
you see the pier their little hitch
where we throw out the back to you those

199
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,269
who did not convert to actual phone
users

200
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,360
but there are it's been growing
dramatically ever since

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,509
and strangely enough for us

202
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:38,750
what we have seen is that people who
previously did not understand

203
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,079
the benefit of free software

204
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,709
started getting it are on because they
understood suddenly

205
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,008
that there is something about
controlling technology

206
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,910
people would never cared about this
suddenly started using the service

207
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,880
which also means by the way that we now
got a whole lotta other issues

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,009
to deal with from users because those
were usability issues

209
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:05,269
where you know someone expected things
to work in a certain way

210
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,459
and just tried it out and somehow it
didn't magically behave exactly that way

211
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:14,149
so for us it was a great left in his
ability to be honest

212
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,420
on that made us experience

213
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,670
bomb things in a completely new and bum

214
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,620
previously unimaginable ways however

215
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,420
all of that arm

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,699
still wrapped into on the

217
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:36,508
initial concept with which we started
that everything goes back to the

218
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:37,050
upstream

219
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,219
nothing stays with us and that's pretty
much the end of it so if you want to see

220
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,189
more about call out

221
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,360
