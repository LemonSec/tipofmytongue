1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,210
play with it and change it there will be
another I think talk later today with

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,490
which will explain

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,410
the house about to open source I harbor

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,519
I I'm using ca

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,359
for unit 40 points to get the device you
need a out the bottom corner of the

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,199
block unit on LCD display

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,840
and unita new credit card to move a

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,230
the the software on the the harbor

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,500
and of course you need a power supply so
basically

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,890
you can't use a about there are some
kind of a battery army there are plenty

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,530
of from the bottom of course

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,820
and most of these so hahaha to the other
comp or so

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,219
rely on of I'll processor manufacture
and buy whole winner

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,620
and the other company which is also
popular is structured Miami

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,000
of my devices so using can only hurt me
but when are

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,430
processor and some more horny mix what
makes it's about getting company and I

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,629
let him here as well

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,220
so it was a nice coincidence that the
headquarter about your company

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,030
its nearby my home so I can go there and
get dedicated support

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,360
and get the port it's much easier

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,600
for me to work with them they they have
great support I'll

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,729
this is so but what about you see here
is a

23
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,009
then s or she know niekro and I'm also

24
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,159
also able to vote by dawn a 2006 him
because I'll

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,470
there's another company at a Chinese
company manufacturing corpuscles Harbor

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,229
borsa

27
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,500
call to the their lineup for more Cisco
tho

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,200
could be bored because so the leading
developer there is so

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,340
call from bomb to me and his friends
they stand behind

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,689
there are they're open source product so
you can create

31
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:51,789
you know you're free to buy a are
warning next door to be more

32
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,159
annual your door what I do at home so
above the LCD display

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,740
there are different items from this
place is you should make sure not to

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,399
your display is compatible with the
board that you have I am

35
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,288
its it'll be nice if that this place the
screen of course

36
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,190
problem I help from

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,450
a few pics to share I

38
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,829
mistake that I did y los working on this
project and I would like to share with

39
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,209
the

40
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,349
with you on the event please make sure
that you want to repeat my

41
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,379
prime steaks first the polearm by dr.

42
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,950
used to be so Sarah cable I

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,179
this is so prices so cable because with
it

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,560
you can do but I can't I expect a wide
dog who told her a colonel

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,670
it's not working couple public I

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,099
it's also nice to use cables and power
supplies

47
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,920
but I recommend it by the I my picture
on the comp or

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,988
this can save a lot of cry a lot of time
another

49
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,659
think it's that time the spectrum course
are using Cup are moving come from

50
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,280
nicole

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,080
me Krazy kar konam my personal

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,250
recommendation it's not by an aunt how

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,519
lot more teacher planning tool after
planning tool

54
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll report though there was this that
going to distribution around

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,200
redistribution of I someone on it
because

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,440
yeah it's much easier to work with them
the public on board not post only from

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,450
me cross the car

58
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,458
I by the way

59
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,340
if you're familiar with robbery five
like I was I started with a rock hard

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,150
by Raspberry Pi boats from as the car
the small not

61
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,250
this this kind of course I in most cases
support from across the

62
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,730
I'll and

63
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,359
one last thing it some some think it's
not working for

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,069
first the first time you run it and this
is actually happening quite a lot when

65
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:53,390
you're

66
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,319
working with softer on this kind of
course try to restart

67
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,399
I only found CNN but sometimes it helps
so

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,069
now face causing a rise

69
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,170
and try to imagine I put in all the
bright and shiny

70
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,750
I put the whole now I'm gonna shoot show
we'll

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,488
something made it home think there to
see the homemade

72
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:21,638
I popular this is how it looks good its

73
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,820
it's not exactly right

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,130
it's not exactly have I but I

75
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,520
actually when my mother so this she said

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,120
all my would you like to interview my
public for a while I can I said no this

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
is this affect it much better

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,650
so what is she here is sad I'll

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,479
aboard from money makes a kind sports
channel micro

80
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,008
I patch to an out of touch screen is
such a rush on it

81
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,040
and this is a screenshot of fry bison

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,540
20 working on the device I am

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,860
that has so much k most I'll basically
and I'm not a doctor and get you is

84
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,259
being

85
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,350
an alarm cable but actually a few

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,220
issue if you a good crop think maybe you
can

87
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,389
make some kind of a nice boxing for it
and put it inside

88
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,539
by the way this is a homemade some of
the public device

89
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:19,570
we talk a source hardware which is
capable who think

90
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,340
any minimum distribution as well as some
point so which did

91
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,859
not just by some device its I morty

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,120
morty operating system device now I
would like to or share with you my name

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,240
open source project at school I don't
succeed and I'll

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,430
the second for tenant some see games
from the

95
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,199
Linux oxy medics oxy is so I'll

96
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,919
get cut open source project which I have
set a colonel

97
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,030
which is so compatible great I

98
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,719
all develop a more sober who have which
have from

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,069
where we are processors

100
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,979
so their tree thinks that you should the

101
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,639
should get working too haha Linux
distribution

102
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,030
and that is so running Cup final output
or at least moving fine

103
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,068
on other brother home port you need the
bootloader

104
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,490
first then you need a colonel

105
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,850
and the sensual I'm using coal winner
I've devices with Oracle we are

106
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,759
processed

107
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,530
I have to use so that there are some
sick or no and finally the third

108
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,669
component is the

109
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,620
root file system on the distribution and
the pen ink the

110
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,039
the distribution that I choose I'd put
to the front of

111
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,509
process so basically what I did wants to
take off

112
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,750
the Linux the ok so she Curnow

113
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,699
and humour to order dog unit from to
build from source

114
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,080
went to Pinkberry me crazy cart looking
for me

115
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,580
there was some projects I the Python
community

116
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,960
which was sporting by some I V I 20

117
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,650
on the board so I took on the sort the
source course available for

118
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,448
on the board and I created a by the puck
from each

119
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,080
for on the board and 2 I'm mixed the
Linux talks with it

120
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,599
and finally I got on the crew is the cop
which was more think

121
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,650
by the success with my device the whole
process of making this is some

122
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,460
if it's not difficult but is
time-consuming because there are a lot

123
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,508
of things that you have to do

124
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,280
I so a few haha this kind of develop a
more sane

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,349
you just want to cry out of eyes on a
weed out

126
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,710
I without losing a lot of time you can

127
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,930
crop pick up our but by social scene
which

128
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,430
I'll say they gonna as the carbon so
what it on your device

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,259
the

130
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,490
a few words so I would like to share if
you were a worse about

131
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,259
presence of popcorn images so basically
that I come

132
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,599
as I schedule for running com in tho
devices as well

133
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,819
hotspot devices there never pick things
up you shouldn't

134
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,900
new

135
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,719
first you have to install the program
development course

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,169
and I'm

137
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,508
and two separate development the
environment Dawson

138
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:17,330
from this think you need a computer or a
virtual machine rancor with the Linux

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,909
distribution the cup with a comfortable
and recommended Linux distribution

140
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,330
by the I might rise on our want to open
source a fedora

141
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,289
as well Santos the development tools
that can run a target bill system

142
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,909
and for the d'amico I'm base with we
don't you can

143
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,000
create I p.m. packages and

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,479
finally when you have the RPM packages
you can prepare

145
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,490
the parts and truck from each president
Sepp costed

146
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,200
I at bison dock or it it is using could
get for source control system

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,350
and it also has some carry the which is
so

148
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,790
I use for outcall reviews

149
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,370
so you can double the court the source
for printing

150
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,870
I'll after that cue

151
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,890
you have to be up to the shower p.m.
packages for our be set up

152
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,250
R&B some operational that power

153
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,620
there are a lot of people are asking
that can you bought by someone a

154
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,529
Raspberry Pi
