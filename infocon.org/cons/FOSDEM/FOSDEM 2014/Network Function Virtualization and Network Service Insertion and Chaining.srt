the Gores Group

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,619
nope

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,289
up

5
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:23,920
up

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,750
up

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,750
hello hello

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,750
flow

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:41,120
below

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,120
PLO

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,690
group

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,989
it's over

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,640
word

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,710
up

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,199
hi

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,290
name is by logic but I'll I'm from of
risque

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,260
a working and Brisbane staff systems
cannot picture

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,910
so 3&1/2 ticket to network service in
session

19
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,910
and cheney using OpenStack so this is
the end up going out

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,270
first and take it with you or you and
then

21
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,470
hypertension muchly mission and is
Deanne and

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,600
really go through cloud resource
discovery

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,759
and OpenFlow controller and we have a
couple of compliments and OpenFlow

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,500
controller

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,400
I'll sarin consumer a floor manager

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,010
and didn't see on a person is in session
and time

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,430
chairman and the future work somewhere
and then we have

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,760
cautions so

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,399
into the warm like I'll the new
difficult to resist

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,150
in the cloud and run mint we have the

31
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,880
scale a movie elasticity and such as
well as T

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,019
and having a very very difficult systems

33
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,610
so right now we have a all the

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,320
commercial hardware be regarded by Anya

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,579
with lot of money so that they'll be

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,959
deployed in your data centers using your

37
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,910
and when you want to find something you
said means

38
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,390
I the time to required are

39
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,488
to get the new service into the
deployment takes more than

40
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,519
I know switching the hardware and then

41
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,940
making it suitable for the cloud
deployment and

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,329
as if you are being be there have a
skeleton last city

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,549
and again the same they are bang aren't
paying for the project

44
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,459
takes more when compared to the heart
hardware

45
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,320
so been a good summer recess

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,170
are using an appointment for functions
using what image

47
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,570
okay so there are we can have a great we
can reduce the time

48
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,850
for I nurseries for lasting and we can
have

49
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,730
scan it would be in the last city as
well so are multiple deployment use

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,030
cases for it and then

51
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,709
like from application development and i
ended up with a stark picture

52
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,889
and we have a hybrid cloud deployment so
I'll

53
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,790
build on the current requirements we can
deploy these networks and missus

54
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,980
I'll for example we have a at the Tehran
over

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,190
have to resist tire and application that
ended up mister

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,220
and we have a different the network
services required

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,290
are behind in the traffic coming onto
the web they're

58
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,060
and then the perfect pitch and reading
from prepared to the

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,639
application pair and again the from
obligation paired with the

60
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,769
gonna mister that and they're up against
not picture

61
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,579
and also we have about the high with
hybrid cloud deployment

62
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,168
a bear we have a multiple I know our
applications running

63
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,399
in the cloud and we have a the better
observer sending

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,520
far general purpose use from the
customer's

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,780
like that so the need of network
services

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,039
for these different batters are
different acids

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,440
so I just so you know I am

68
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,330
give a glance at the OpenStack like we
have multiple components of OpenStack

69
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,080
like horizon Keystone I know we have no

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,169
on all we have on our scheduler I'm

71
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,010
them he is over and we have no way piano
a computer and we have a new prime

72
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,020
but never function network what solution
and connectivity services

73
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,430
and we have plans for a minute stories
and preparing the

74
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,680
whatcha mission managers and we have
other companies like a cinder

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,750
horizon and Keystone for authentication
and horizon is for

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,449
the dashboard where you can configure
the services and networks

77
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:20,449
and we have a center for object store

78
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,550
so what do the internet for function
much a huge a

79
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,059
we are holding me know what time is
dinner for function so

80
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:33,349
running in the network function within
the

81
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,438
watchin machine how for example

82
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,919
let us take an open-source software it's
like an HR proxy

83
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,270
it's a seven or balancer which we can
run it

84
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,748
inside the russian machine and we can
run you know

85
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:51,059
for I believe its fire on we can use it
as a %uh what you allow

86
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,370
pyro at a function which mention final
something we can use any

87
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,819
VPN obligations assets like I dissected

88
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,939
so up basically produces the

89
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,050
expenditure and operational expenditure
the

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,610
primary advantage and we can replace the
custom hardware

91
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,740
replacement light we don't need any
specific branded

92
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,710
a networking gear I where we can use the
existing

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,710
watch allies dan ronan so what should
surrender on

94
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,239
are guarded by these networks have
missus and do the

95
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,740
our tenant no networks and there we have

96
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,069
as the networks and a non is DNA probes
but never function right solution

97
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,289
doesn't need asset

98
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,349
as dinners work weeks are pretty fine
networks it can work on a non is Dan it

99
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,020
protects

100
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,389
and an FBI plan says deployment is a

101
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,539
very much complementary to as genitals

102
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,800
because the is janet was you the
flexibility of network abstraction

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,699
where are we can use this an epic
abstraction to reply these

104
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,909
IMF means and the there are very well

105
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:04,310
are together a you know complement each
other that the these two technologies

106
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,649
so out the networking application
deployment

107
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,349
a without the need for a bits of network
devices

108
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,009
make we don't need upgrade I York if you
want to increase the capacity

109
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,199
but you don't need upgrade to new divide
assets but you just need to change the

110
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,830
image

111
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,419
except that's enough so I we have
tremendous advantages

112
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,580
are on having the enough for you and out

113
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,698
you know the coming up the as den
networks are complementing this

114
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,569
on it enough for me a defiant where we
can now save a lot of money

115
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,180
and we can definitely I showcase

116
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,909
a better performance so I'll

117
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,620
the a nephew challenges we have I ease

118
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,579
like performance for us to follow so

119
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,810
when we say they're nectar function or
television a

120
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,949
the bar better function running on a
specific hardware

121
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,979
what says a never functioned running
inside watching mission

122
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,899
so obviously we have our you know

123
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:14,579
the lot of bottlenecks where are the
Packers going to the hypervisor and then

124
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,389
the a what's nation library and then to
the washing machine

125
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,439
the function inside the watchin mission

126
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,500
on and again

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,939
up dude is the playing of this network
services

128
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:32,819
the backing up occasions which banned
user is going to axis

129
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,848
so the impact of performance I

130
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,699
of network function directly I'm bag use
impact on the axis performance on the

131
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:42,769
petition assets

132
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,850
performances the

133
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,890
I'm is a challenge and we have a the a

134
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,420
and the talent like to make a dish so

135
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,360
we have a the application migration
where are you know

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,370
whenever the application migrates from
one

137
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,970
plow to the other clout are you know

138
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,060
I and the

139
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,609
policy changes which require I am NOT
for these network functions

140
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,290
those policy changes as well has to
migrate along with the application

141
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,410
so migration is and there are

142
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,500
biggest challenge are to implement these
nectar function what solution

143
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,319
and we have a non is doing it works for
scale-up

144
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,250
and a scaled-down and a argument against
initialization of network services

145
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,779
based on traffic nor make that ass a
city where are the traffic

146
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,899
are is a no would be near we don't need
the

147
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,850
network services the mini netbook sends
so we can have a few fire or something

148
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,429
and we have a heavy nor running into the
system

149
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:53,949
are we can scale up by these network
services based on the traffic backed

150
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,140
are with the club up the tent

151
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,620
so

152
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,189
up what is the this is the cloud
resources data are

153
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,480
so with either a software-defined
networking

154
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,839
so what is the cloud resources data the
cloud is absurd i is

155
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,839
at the events I'll event generator

156
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,819
about Ben be up clear up in the launcher
whatcha

157
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,740
nbsp net watch her mission RnB create a
lot our network

158
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,309
and the you know any that like it when
you add the

159
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,760
network when you create a port
manipulate their poor so these are the

160
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
different arguments

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,250
and the data generated along with the
zemin's are very useful

162
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,790
by I it's so I'll

163
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,529
we have the again the open OpenFlow
protocol

164
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,540
for as Jim software-defined networking
late

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,709
I'll we can define than other networking
like

166
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,899
how do you want to or are who

167
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,970
are with our data are when we create a
network

168
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,569
okay we will store that network their
time together is and we can take their

169
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,059
property action

170
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,040
they've done their data them billions
build surround a bit on is very much

171
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,349
important

172
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,520
so for defining the networking so

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,270
the end up meaning of the
software-defined networking like

174
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,000
we have a defined networking late we had
a program that bore

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,160
and how to program that bore we have we
need other data

176
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,279
which is required and we want to use
that data

177
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,740
in a specific manner no based on our a
requirement

178
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,370
are based on the current pic but for
example %uh scaling up their process

179
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,069
getting don't network services

180
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:40,269
summer and we have the

181
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,720
computer you intended to for example
like whenever we

182
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,089
paying too much in machine the daytime
originated like

183
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,880
what is the computer was on which the VM
is good in creating

184
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,839
and what lol the horse no details were
the capacity of the horse nor

185
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,929
and what is the story of the what is
there around what are the sea views

186
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:04,100
and all the host obedience and whenever
a new course is added into the

187
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,699
and network into the I'll are doesn't

188
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,870
and that up did as well be quite

189
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,010
a to stored in the cloud was hosted

190
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,790
and we have our network events and ate
out for example like creating it more

191
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,439
creating creating a subnet and they're
creating a poor

192
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:26,069
and they're creating the poor a makes
land ports on now

193
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:30,589
oh yes in a computer or so the other
different the

194
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,920
daytime events and data out which 00
we're going to collect together

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,399
and build an intelligence and we have to
be we will define that work

196
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,600
for launching these netbooks address
essential

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,199
so I this is the high no picture of our
cloud reserves data

198
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,890
we have %uh the cloud resource are no
why not run

199
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,269
annoyance for a the

200
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,740
spinning up to the nth and we have a
neutron

201
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,569
up for apartment located

202
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,860
and we have other cloud resource up

203
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,000
data which is required a Vera

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,829
we're going to capture all the vents
generator obey these two components

205
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,979
and we're going to store darted out into
the are

206
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,240
cloud resource division salaries

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,250
database and then I'll we have you seen
the picture

208
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,290
we have about the OpenFlow controller
and I we have the OpenFlow controller

209
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,540
and we have down either company in car

210
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,980
a CRT consumer I which is required

211
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,170
for capturing this day about I generated
from the OpenFlow kinda hopin' stack of

212
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,699
dollar

213
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,829
to the OpenFlow controller and we have
the

214
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:46,370
are different computer north's character
to the OpenStack controller

215
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,589
using open this message

216
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,640
so I'll be are all these data are
communication

217
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,589
a the are communication between

218
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,610
the car because they're dying to
OpenFlow controller is through the

219
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,429
missus cures

220
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:07,159
we have the RTC's YES on messages and we
have different

221
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,250
I'll a notification find her pics
engines

222
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,380
where we will create the cues to capture
this data

223
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,030
from the cloud reserves data for the
OpenFlow controller

224
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,490
so I'll we have %uh the network service
infrastructure

225
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,709
where we can not create the chains
network service chains

226
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,179
and the weekend launched in prague
Severus chains

227
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:33,360
I integrated into the act out was as
good as a plugin

228
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,909
and we have a are two different features
like girly

229
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,919
two chains and lately chains and we have
about this year the consumer

230
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,299
where we will consume the data generated
by these a

231
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,709
know our on neutron through the

232
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:55,709
cloud resource arbitration service to
the ASEAN countries

233
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,689
so about the clouds obscured I really
like

234
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:04,289
a the date on which is captured are from
these

235
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:07,640
immense a bizarre relate to the

236
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,449
plovers near the consumer are being no

237
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,309
through the notification fine art
exchange the OpenFlow cue

238
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,280
are for battered I'll no I'm not run
messages

239
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,750
and fan-out cue are far each ORF
Cumberland

240
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,010
like we can have multiple open flow
controllers multiplier that

241
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,020
in your network so there is a common QR

242
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,079
for the management messages from
OpenFlow controller

243
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,599
to the protesters this coating and we
have are the clothes was there the

244
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,339
consumer

245
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,949
very well that there is a direct
interface between this

246
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,179
cloud users data consumer the OpenFlow
controller

247
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,309
so that the data collector from our

248
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:53,120
or CRB close associate of OpenStack
humbler

249
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,419
will be passed on to the OpenFlow
controller

250
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:00,350
this year the consumer will receive the
Jess on messages

251
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,789
from CRT seventies on the renter with
just some messages

252
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,279
we had that just on missus can become
worker into

253
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,140
the I'll into your messages

254
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,449
which are required for the OpenFlow
controller but we can have all been flow

255
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,549
controller allied

256
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:20,919
open be like are any third party are any
common children their assets

257
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,630
just we have the right are the
corresponding but I worry about this

258
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,209
just send messages are converted into

259
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,289
I the messages which can understand by
the open

260
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,159
flow Cup

261
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,409
and this year in consumer controversy at
these

262
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,470
OpenFlow car controller our database

263
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,900
it configures all the data receive
generator from the OpenStack under

264
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,630
using the integration API

265
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,919
so will see the sherry consumer on the
OpenFlow controller

266
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,829
Ave that the STP interface between the
CRB and OpenFlow controller

267
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:07,639
the initial messages let me know where
the OpenFlow controller comes up

268
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,279
in the network are Danish in messages
will be sent

269
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,109
are to the OpenStack controller clout
resource

270
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,520
divisions at least where I'm

271
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,129
it will a store all the OpenFlow
controller information instigator vs

272
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,620
and in division of OpenFlow controller
application service

273
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,199
the OpenFlow controller can have
multiple applications at such

274
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,880
make it can have a for entering
applications

275
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,890
also line open flow controller

276
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,600
and also we have a the russian control
mechanism

277
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,689
we're at the competition was shinning
also is maintained

278
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,610
in the database well the integration
divers

279
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,959
for renders specific are open source

280
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,480
OpenFlow controller like open daylight

281
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,799
severe a its not only as specific

282
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,440
a open flow controller we can have it
for the Nikon children their assets

283
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,450
I'm going to open to a condom not be and
we have the right

284
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,799
our own drivers to integrate I camped on

285
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:20,600
captured his daytime confident the open
flippant

286
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,870
so this is that a compliment light floor
manager

287
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,529
through manager a pinkish OpenFlow
controller position service

288
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,390
are Vera this OpenFlow controller
opposition severance

289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,419
I'll is there a step in the face

290
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,549
to capture the data and configure the
open floor controller

291
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:42,940
the confirmation of cloud resources
liked what they were there to capture

292
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,669
due to

293
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,940
from one no one will run through the
clerk results data

294
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,250
can be configured into the OpenFlow
controller

295
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,470
and we have another database running in
the OpenFlow controller

296
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,860
very strong leader and we have washing
support

297
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,289
the floor manager like at the our
confirmation of

298
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,090
I these evens from OpenStack unprofor

299
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,039
and putting it and now and the race of

300
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,460
OpenFlow controller the

301
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,960
even standard from those a conflagration
offered it ever since

302
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,820
in the OpenFlow controller I will be
given to the Oprah manager

303
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,080
beer I'll are geared up for a manager

304
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,149
will are bill the intelligence

305
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:32,799
like up creating the flows on the OP in

306
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,120
over the years I'll switch on the
compute nodes

307
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,668
so based on these a the russian mission

308
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:43,760
there don't be impaired up from No and
networks imports data

309
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,020
from your prom are will be stored in the

310
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,230
OpenFlow controller and OpenFlow
controller are

311
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,250
the floor manager in the OpenFlow
controller when captured their daytime

312
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,659
cleared the flaws required and
configures

313
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:04,659
there when we switch on the computer its

314
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,479
so we have a

315
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,210
NATO service in church in changing

316
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,480
yep so we have the opportunity for

317
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,820
topologies other layer 2 and layer 7 on
networks

318
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,250
the pan and never carry isolation Lake
Tahoe to be a

319
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,520
gender create the isolation of traffic
between different

320
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,600
attendant in phnom the

321
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,539
cloud deployment and a defining the
networks to program

322
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,610
the advert to recess in multiple our
deployment mortar

323
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,689
make we have a engine or a beer a

324
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,100
then it broke nor in the OpenStack with
the traffic

325
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,539
comes from the Internet fall company
network nor and then

326
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:54,700
goes to the postponing avocation

327
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,950
and the VM and we have the a

328
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,860
other paper network up occasionally or
controller

329
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,620
the late only a sound support of
OpenFlow controller

330
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,809
and we have a third type car what unit
are functions like

331
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,980
happening get much of our network
function inside a virtual machine

332
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,299
so these are the three different down
more to its of

333
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,668
no network said recess where we compared
the services

334
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,760
weekend said the Services and changes
have a sister

335
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,240
and the confirmation of these networks
at recess running inside watching

336
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,580
mission is and other

337
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,658
important apart there a

338
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,710
for example we have a the server load
balancer

339
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,820
which is at your proxy it is having its
own conflagration like the other config

340
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,490
at all that would serve their time

341
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,049
the abe et cetera and somebody for iPad
evidence we have all the policies

342
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,490
required this can be different %um

343
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,890
a different types of for the prime like
for example policies have different in

344
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,929
the network nor

345
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,919
pulses are different for of gun dealer
network applications

346
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,919
on deployed using open for a gondola
netbooks

347
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,500
are the logical functions

348
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,779
based on the attended networks

349
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,159
so I'll hold me hold me the confidence
in

350
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,510
from OpenStack Ambler do these I

351
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,980
wacho functions running in terror
watching mission

352
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,640
so upper edge network node we have about
that the Jets an interface

353
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,690
at the just to arrest a pain to face
where we can

354
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,909
configure relive his contribution data

355
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:36,110
from OpenStack humbler to the Joubert no

356
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,549
and we have no RSS manager for

357
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,860
OpenFlow controller network applications
appear

358
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,070
I'll we capture all the data I'll from

359
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,289
the confirmation date of paper functions
are

360
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,989
who the or OpenFlow controller network
applications

361
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:57,480
and for what should head for functions
we have the I really isn't

362
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,090
there really isn't is a just as other
them in which is running

363
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,649
on the computer nor we have the netbook
from concerning

364
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,189
so are when you configure the network
function from OpenStack come to look

365
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,499
the competition we get there through the
GS on missus RTC messages

366
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:17,499
and to capture by there really isn't on
the computer or

367
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:21,720
and religion real again used only word
what I was helium

368
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,080
to configure the network function inside
the virtual machine

369
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,970
so the three different types of our
network

370
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,320
services which we are required and

371
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,360
the competition I used for these

372
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,238
network services

373
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:44,009
so I do the high no picture I for
network services

374
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,639
so we have the open second color we have
OpenFlow controller

375
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:51,619
and open to a country where we have
protesters

376
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:54,709
the scoring custom consumer and

377
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,860
OpenFlow controller application service
and we have a firewall

378
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,699
a obligation firewall and the surrender
balancer

379
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,369
we have the baby where are we going to
get all the data

380
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:09,639
capture from these on your pronto law
through the

381
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:13,168
produce was discovered in and the UN's

382
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:17,179
from the database will be captured by
the floor manager

383
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,259
and flow manager using OpenFlow protocol

384
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,440
it's going to configure the open
mismatch of a computer notes

385
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,730
and a we have the network services I
like

386
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,179
fire all about tradition Fire Island
surrender balancer

387
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,610
a they running on the computer clearer
now watchin missions

388
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,049
and said the russian mission running on
a computer nor

389
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,399
and we have observers running on another
computer

390
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,149
no so are the cost money

391
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:50,320
flows which have required I'll based on
the vents

392
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,350
generator are going to capture and the
flow through you pushed

393
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,610
from the floor manager to the open
mismatch

394
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,809
of compute nodes there are better
function and network services

395
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:06,989
running and as well on the a the plane
applications

396
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,840
like publications are obligations

397
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,939
web server setup occasions are the Vista

398
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,830
the three-day so this is how

399
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,220
the the even generated

400
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,690
by the know our and new prime will be
captured

401
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,629
and stored in a database of OpenFlow
controller

402
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:32,639
and the intelligence bill I'll up with
is geared up

403
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:38,959
from the database by the a floor manager
and pushes the floors

404
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,529
required from now on to the open the
switch on the compute nodes

405
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:48,309
so the flaws me because I figured up
from the floor manager

406
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:53,730
whenever that I miss packet generator I
home by the open misfits

407
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,299
connected to the OpenFlow controller

408
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,230
you the network services

409
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,460
a here we have dissolving them

410
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,149
laker we have and network services can
be

411
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:16,768
from different vendors together like are
any open source applications as

412
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:22,210
like how we don't need to have use a
specific lender

413
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,809
for network services and the the
accelerators

414
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,320
hairdo I'll for Archer functions

415
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,879
so all we need accelerators far these
mucho functions are

416
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:37,939
to compare the performance of these
muscle functions

417
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,039
from the fiscal devices so

418
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,070
we have the netbook service chain
infrastructure where are we have we can

419
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,210
configure network functions

420
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,679
and we can create the chains and we have
our dynamic networks creation

421
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,419
but Jamie and we have that competition

422
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:02,460
the neighbor function competition we
have room and the conflagration

423
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,090
and a map this contribution to the
network technician and then will deploy

424
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,549
virtual

425
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:12,499
and doing this they don't have a slant
Jane lunch we have our

426
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:15,549
are different issues like we have at the
same post

427
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,840
are Deborah functions

428
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,499
I inserted chain are two functions in
one computer or and the function at a

429
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:24,369
computer nor

430
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,600
and also we have a lot the migration
support

431
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,009
where we love senator functions the
migrating from one computer to the other

432
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:39,009
computer

433
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,730
yeah a the future role a which applying
to have is that the lately and it's a

434
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,359
recent session chanting support

435
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:53,418
and then number seventy statistics and
elasticity

436
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:59,580
so excuse

437
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,730
the statistics of on it works neighbor
functions

438
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,340
I camp is done there are started sticks
generated by these never functions

439
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,809
the network I services can be scaled up
askin long

440
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,809
and elasticity out these network
services and a dynamic launching up

441
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:16,970
Disney Co services

442
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,210
are based on the never function
statistics

443
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,619
and Monday morning broke services
support I'll a chair growth

444
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,809
I'll like gonna group nor and North
controller opposition support

445
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,460
for and for rent so happy occasions and
network services using an actor function

446
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,230
which Asian

447
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,859
and also are to improve the performance
of paper functions

448
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:45,859
the piece a pass through support of our
network service millions

449
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,009
yeah a by accident so for OpenStack from
commercial and open source communities

450
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:56,509
so that's right now we only year started
using OpenStack

451
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:00,179
and there is a need for a cloudy
Thursday to

452
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,139
like captured these events and the use
it

453
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:07,939
for you know are as DN kind of networks

454
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,989
to reply the network said recess chain

455
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:14,239
launching and upbringing in the

456
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:18,379
OpenFlow controller into the open a
stack

457
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:23,350
deployments is very much needed for

458
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,799
so that the software-defined networking
will be off

459
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,418
no better use

460
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,659
and there had been services insertion
and chaining framework

461
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,769
where we can on add pierde una cosa

462
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:41,399
network chains and instead that looks at
recess

463
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,928
and configure these netbooks avaricious
and washing of

464
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:49,519
this on netbook services competition
assets

465
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,200
and multiply mean mort like a around
deploying these network times as in

466
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
ignore

467
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,799
are deploying these network services
inside up

468
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,850
OpenFlow controller obligations

469
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:10,850
are brian is network services as a
magnet for function which alleviation

470
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,590
so yeah the other guys out behind

471
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,959
this work late we have I seen you have
the ability from his

472
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,460
for learned Chief Software Architect and
we have their manager which I said above

473
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,220
and we have the team to not Mira

474
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,300
chicane Simon brown purse at together

475
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,310
can to make this a undergo pushes

476
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:47,310
up

477
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,909
are

478
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,809
we have a the confirmation I really
mechanism

479
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,760
where we have are the me agent which is
running on the computer no

480
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,760
excuse so

481
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,020
on the confirmation battle from
OpenStack dashboard

482
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,870
is related to the edges and messages to
the compute nodes

483
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,729
I'm really hungry is going to capture
these messages

484
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,620
and configure the network function sorry
to

485
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,320
pretty good like the we don't have an
old

486
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,490
how many milliseconds winning

487
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,940
count as such wouldn't see but its

488
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,299
a well I we didn't see it big delay

489
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:55,299
it's a few milliseconds if that is the
case then it is

490
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,850
a it is through far other competent in
OpenStack has been like we have not New

491
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,379
York know why not run

492
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,480
no law which we are

493
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,860
you know or real largely images a new
drug which would create the networks

494
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,860
they are going to stick together we
don't say anything

495
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,420
are we end up up the proof-of-concept
more right now

496
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,310
yep Korean island byron just we meta

497
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,800
couple of member function to the chain
were deployed in our

498
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,800
desk at work

499
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,980
