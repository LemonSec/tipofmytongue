1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,070
I

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,820
I we get from a TV crew perfect

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,710
X

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,500
iPod touch my voice there was a great
night last night at the very much

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,860
and I got here

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,759
about five minutes ago after scrambling
to catch the last bus the get here in

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,380
time

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,500
so I won't have any references to
earlier talks from this morning because

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,180
I was sleep

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,410
probably to talk to you was good

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,769
it's great to be back I love coming
across from every year and

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,539
I've been doing just the stuff for a
long time now I started

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,989
I

14
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,890
can I get to go for I think it was in
June 2000

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,170
three

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,550
so I've I've been doing this just for
for a long time to think about for a

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,180
long time

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,560
and now in the past couple beers I was
fortunate enough

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,380
on to become employed by a company that
lets me the research thing about this

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,260
stuff full-time

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,690
I'm so now I work at let my job is
called industry analyst

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,220
which I did nobody really knows what
that means but what means to me

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,740
is that I could spend all my time doing
research about state-of-the-art software

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,170
development and how that compares with
people are actually doing we're actually

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,580
are

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,230
on and now and all the suffering not
back to my

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,540
my initial love my National Open Source
love object to

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,050
and say look where is Jen to but I just
but more importantly where's

29
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,360
everybody today

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,100
the distro world on and where do we need
to go um

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,100
and you know why are so many developers

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,619
running backs inside a flat tax

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,910
on my part I just because experience Sox
as organist certificate what got today

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,220
and Joe is going to see some of the
slides for the third time although I'm

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,320
saying something completely different
because I've given three talking about

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,990
four days

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm but he will not be the same got a
promise you that

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,789
I'm so some questions and I'm trying to
avoid both fights but sometimes I just

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,960
wanna start with a few

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,600
on the key questions from me one thing
about alright where to stay where they

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,240
need to go

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
is Howell are how our actual software
developers in the real world doing

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,980
things

44
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,100
and how could this shows do a better job
of catering to on how our Users doing

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,700
things like this just better cater to
them

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,260
because there's all these things
happening out there I'm to

47
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,609
we're as this shows and I'm and here's
how many have you

48
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,820
are volunteers for a Linux distribution
strange and

49
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,030
excellent perfect

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,510
time hun you how many have you think
your distribution assault all the

51
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,929
difficult problems

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,049
I got a good so you're here for a reason

53
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,870
you want to think about this stuff I'm
and feel free to catch me after

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,329
I would have beers talk to anymore I'm
but

55
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,689
but things are going up to today is ok
where r developers where users today

56
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,909
where they need to be in what what we
need to do to build the right kinds of

57
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:58,450
things for

58
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,510
I'm and

59
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,409
less importantly got the bottom is what
we want

60
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,888
it's great to build

61
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,430
a distro that's friendly for new
maintainers to get into the distro

62
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,319
but it's more important to bill on the
people actually wanna rock if you don't

63
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,810
have people who want to run the fang

64
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,340
you never going to get anybody that
wants a container because at this whole

65
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,780
final thinking about things like

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,030
not know incomes maintainer magically
without being is the first

67
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,069
and so we need to build software that
users

68
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,819
and that developers want to run on and
that's not happening

69
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,010
and an hour after today I'm so now i'm
in search of a little bit of data

70
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,000
and apologize for the black and white
but of I i mean excuse

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,979
on I did a little bit of data mining
across so

72
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:49,319
a few different data sources and you may
not know it but when you talk in places

73
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,339
like talking is

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,560
and a Google searches I'm searching for
what you did

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,989
I i'm looking behind the scenes to try
and understand what are people doing

76
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,509
and why and why and some other state a
is more reliable than others so

77
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:05,548
if you if you don't like one particular
data source that's fine what makes it

78
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,109
interesting is that runs across multiple
data sources

79
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,780
and that's also what makes it more
reliable to me Michael the seven so

80
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,060
capable chance find

81
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,289
if you know about soccer but you look at
the transfer of Google Trends

82
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,320
arm across her news across Stack
Overflow for example across get our

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,650
I've even done some mining IRC logs that
hot on my machine Kevin Danna suffer

84
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,469
long after those

85
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:30,580
some data in there a condition from
thanks on and then across

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,820
in this example on one of the others is
one external where they actually write a

87
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,490
survey what distro are you running

88
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,479
and what you see is not really
surprising there's a part of me but to

89
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,099
users

90
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,630
a slow to them um but what is
interesting

91
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,919
is his arch right and Sony pointed out

92
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,190
on Twitter I think was last night or
this morning on

93
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,800
I don't think there are any our
structure I mean if your accusers

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,490
so what what's going on about right

95
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,930
um as another sense where you got this
set of traditional distros the set up

96
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,919
new distros

97
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,849
I'm and even the new ones I don't think
I've solved the problems that need to be

98
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:12,490
salt

99
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,270
and that's what we're going to talk
about today on but if you look at the

100
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,210
stuff you see some interesting trends
emerging

101
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,760
in terms of if you think about this a
triangle to intuition about

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,080
what are these people like you're using
is different data sources

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,690
I at least nothing I think I'll try and
such as normal people

104
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,020
at least and so far you can be normal
and be running Linux at the same time

105
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm now

106
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,510
when external alright these people are
interested in technology they're a

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,099
little bit more technically savvy

108
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,860
I am packing is there are actual
developers are not just

109
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,639
users enthusiasts a man so that now sort
my intuition with us

110
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,889
and what's interesting about looking at
the state is that intuition holds true

111
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,389
on you get runs that sort of makes sense
when you think about

112
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,740
where the developers were the
enthusiasts and where the more normal

113
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,080
people running Linux

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,339
on and I don't think and you've got last
trip is here today

115
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:08,490
so it is going to look at at data from
them and talk about them I thought I can

116
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,430
without seeing the

117
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,990
you rarely observed abnormal annexes are
I me if you look at the stuff he sees in

118
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,010
trying to make sense

119
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,139
you see things like father so many
developers crying arch

120
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,320
I am but in terms of visual and normal
you there's a slow but last

121
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,110
whereas you go look at Manch and and I

122
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,190
want to make fundamental just for

123
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,210
while we'll get into that today on but
in terms of normal people running

124
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,430
members loathsome

125
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,699
people love made it super easy it's
super it just tells you like here's what

126
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,479
you need to do and we're gonna do it for
you

127
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,289
and you don't need to think about that
you don't need flexibility up but

128
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:46,560
they're

129
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,099
use right

130
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,740
I am I think all the searches included
1x so it was

131
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,630
meant 1x Arch Linux Debian Linux love
you I'm and not near Lenox

132
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,010
unfortunately so if are masses here
sorry for that I'm

133
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,839
yet so that there's ways to do searches
such that you can

134
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,010
keep out some other stuff you don't want
to happen although it's it's never

135
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,649
perfect

136
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,380
I like for example searching for arch
gives you all the architecture stuff

137
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,570
related to Linux as well

138
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,029
I just you have to deal with it and do
some controls to see

139
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,130
you know if you actually look through
the results you realize that

140
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,740
after you're through a hundred of them
less than 1 I'm talks about architecture

141
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,300
is near

142
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,779
other 99.95 large on

143
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,140
but its it's interesting to look at
these things so I call this is this is

144
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,490
where things are in the closest sense we
can get to real data

145
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,419
because almost nobody actually installed
pa Kong

146
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,769
or something like it we don't know how
many Linux users there are

147
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,339
when you know how many how about with
the breakdown looks like across

148
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,539
different distros

149
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,099
on this is about as close as we can get
to that sort of thing where you look at

150
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,260
multiple data sources you build was less
so

151
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,079
ok it's pretty consistent across a lot
of them on the only one

152
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,099
whereas I a great deal confusion is Matt
on

153
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,740
I don't know is is this number more
right or is that tomorrow

154
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,839
I would almost every other case it's
fairly consistent I

155
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,310
and consistent with at least my
intuition over

156
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,839
so many people use Ubuntu I'll and

157
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,209
unfortunately for me not so many is
trying to anymore

158
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:28,469
on the 2004 was a great year for us

159
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:32,349
I'm and you can give us a little bit
differently and and I say OK if cochran

160
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,269
is

161
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:38,849
is the zero-point what it what the other
data sources look like in comparison

162
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,570
and I can you see things workouts or
even the way you would expect

163
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,470
I am some things are much more biased
toward developers

164
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,490
some are more biased toward I'm normal
users

165
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,570
and some of them with what makes a
really weird two summers on

166
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,329
like I approached great example

167
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:04,239
apparently enthusiast don't like parts
but everybody else does

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,290
so people just enjoy playing a round of
stuff I dunno

169
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,959
I'm not sure how to explain not on but
the most of the stuff does actually

170
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,209
makes sense when you think about it

171
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,839
I'm gonna get away from a dataset
like-minded ideas

172
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,810
and if you look at it just trends over
time without Anne access

173
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,180
to show you volume just look at dropped
runs over time

174
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,160
on you can get some very interesting
ideas over which way things are going

175
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,000
on and I'm not saying by any means but
there's more people running this or that

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm but which where are things going
what do people care about enough to talk

177
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,620
about it

178
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,940
I'm and I put in red

179
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,050
everything that's going up or remaining
stable and greys

180
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,019
everything else on and sockets

181
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,829
its interesting to me and part because
those to new distros

182
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,779
I'm gonna call me other they're not got
mail onto the new data shows are going

183
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,610
up

184
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,410
mom and son dos is actually pretty
stable which is interesting trackback

185
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,430
I'm sorry

186
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,359
the scale I how the timescale this is
sense

187
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,220
I 2010 to 2003

188
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,050
upset about the last ten years or so I'm
which is why I meant

189
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,969
basically doesn't exist until more
recently on an arch you can see some

190
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,860
other some other know is that I was
talking about our people was talking

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,340
about architectures and lacks

192
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,430
back that another picks up on the same
time with open source said because they

193
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,020
were sousa

194
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,140
until they decided to call it up and
make it more

195
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,170
open I guess I'm

196
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,219
but it is our value to look at the same
thing about

197
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,580
while people don't seem to care quite so
much

198
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,630
about things like Paul Slackware Gentoo
for guard ivan is the state

199
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,160
that doesn't mean they are running at
but they are talking about a I

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,680
its it's an assumption is just underlies
our lives this one they don't care

201
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,189
and slats one point the stock is how do
you keep the distro relevant

202
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,330
rubb key people caring about it and one
of those things you have to integrate

203
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,970
with the way they want to work

204
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,230
on investors kind of the city of here's
how packed manager should work towards

205
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,920
gonna keep it that way for ever

206
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,599
I'm stuck on moving forward with the
times up in a skirt was russia's

207
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,860
I and why these trends a top and

208
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,780
over the past eight years or so is his
clout I'm how many of you have ever run

209
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,410
anything in a cloud I

210
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,240
and did did your distro do a good job of
that

211
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,330
are we running back at the time maybe

212
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,730
I am just integrating with this new
style drama something that this was not

213
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,830
done a great job done

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,410
I you know they don't for the most part
do things like native lackluster

215
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,600
like share configuration data I'll like

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,740
you know others the guy named Randy bias

217
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,180
star chemical cloud sky yes this
fantastic analogy of

218
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,329
I cattle verses pat's

219
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,920
where in in a cloud world

220
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,819
all the servers are cattle and if one
gets sick

221
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,950
you just take it out back and shoot it
but in the world we live in

222
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,420
on the servers are past their carefully
taken care of their certainly not kicked

223
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,939
jail so he made a joke about kicking
Academy elevator a community and I think

224
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,260
he

225
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,530
a just got flipped I'm

226
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,540
but its destroys are still in that world
above naming everything carefully and

227
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,730
carefully installing it

228
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,600
i'm for the most part follows these new
things that have come along

229
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,110
I I tried it the reason I'm here late is
to take me 15 minutes to get past the

230
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,230
configuration management

231
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm and that's something people care
deeply about

232
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
and that destroys for the most part
don't handle well on

233
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,280
in other some modules that are in this
or even if it's a pedestrian run

234
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,270
rpm are apt whatever behind-the-scenes
on but it's not native

235
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,170
and at the Dexter side right now I don't
and we don't really care about

236
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,430
I mean sure people can run if they want
to but you know for example why

237
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,069
finally install all the distros using
pop a reason shop

238
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,110
why don't we just set that on the
machine and that's the way you do the

239
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,920
paddle attachment

240
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,949
are is that's what people want to run
stuff and so they slap on their own

241
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,920
package management on top after the fact

242
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,020
and you've got this weird mishmash of
things happening or okay they've got

243
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,319
CPA and they've got haipai they've got

244
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,560
in others on Janes another that's tough
talk to each other

245
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,829
as you've got twenty copy the same thing
different versions of things breaking

246
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,190
its

247
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,200
it's not a great experience time and
that's that's the sort of

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,410
creation as well thanks am

249
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,560
that's not the point right as that
developers today

250
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,780
on maybe not you but

251
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,790
you not the only developers IT research
on on are

252
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,219
are looking for experienced users
configuration and %um and it's not today

253
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,640
either

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,590
I mean even countries on infrastructure
runs well cell co-founder

255
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,670
slowly moving for something a little
more modern I'm safe and has been on for

256
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,240
more than 20 years now as 1993 12 and
see if it on fire came out and we're

257
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,470
still not thinking about

258
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,870
and threatened are do anything distress

259
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,680
here do you think you do a good job
integrating with conflict management

260
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,510
okay

261
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,490
I'm but that's the way people want to
manage their systems

262
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,320
because we're working on my scale work
of transient things we gonna sit around

263
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,590
and saw on things and

264
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,730
you know we we can offer I think red-hot
initially came up video kick-start

265
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,410
on quite a while ago and we kind of did
that and then we stopped

266
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,939
and we need to go farther I need to
start

267
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,920
integrating these things into the way
not just we developed a simple users

268
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
install the distro

269
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,589
I mean why don't you give people an
option to

270
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,280
upload encrypt data repository
configuration management and and we can

271
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,850
start for

272
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,250
busy we are demanding closer

273
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,620
weird servers doing all kinds around
thanks for this running west

274
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,820
I wanna make it a better experience for
the users and when the AM

275
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,020
destroy their installers they inevitably
do and i neva ladue

276
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,840
mom we've got the data for and and its
red replica

277
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,400
and I one great example this how poorly
we had a great looking for cash

278
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,270
management

279
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,120
is chef which switched off the diving
Fox

280
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,710
I you guys art auction house and such an
out-of-date and terrible at that we

281
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,290
don't even want to be in your reply
anymore

282
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,390
just please take us out because we're
doing a better job of being up to date

283
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,150
and having all packages that matter to
us were the domain experts

284
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,069
I'm get us out here and they did which
was great they listened

285
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,860
I but but that's a real problem and it's
a problem for a lot of reasons because

286
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,470
you know as destroyers recreate all
these policies for packaging and

287
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,120
guidelines and coding

288
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,130
on for a reason and it's so everything
works together and so happy

289
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,020
and now we're in this weird sort a
middle ground where if you got

290
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,290
if you've got ISVs I'm software vendors
writing our packaging

291
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,150
it doesn't understand I'll talk to the
rest the distro and

292
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,670
its in between in this point where it
depends on things in the distro

293
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,740
other things depend on yet um but it
doesn't integrate right

294
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,150
and so you end up with all kinds of a
bugs that

295
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:33,290
well some my colleagues would love to
talk to you about for hours

296
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,800
and and so you know we're in this weird
place where

297
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
you know as the search for the most part
going to be stable I

298
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,990
but softer like shop especially software
that sort of cloud like freedom of like

299
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,430
and I was a lot of innovation happened
very quickly how do you keep up with the

300
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,489
pace that because users want to run the
new software

301
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,250
on they want the latest features for the
same time how do we put out something

302
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,900
that stable

303
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,260
Thomas's number I don't think anybody's
really salty a you know some people are

304
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,360
taking an effort like

305
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,959
protect the right of folks that I have
lots of work elections really try to put

306
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,630
you knew were softer for developers on
topic real

307
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,690
but its it's not in a in a place where

308
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,720
you know that's a normal behavior yet
and it's not a place

309
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,410
that users on the developers running the
distress are looking for

310
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,840
on and on in all honesty I'm not sure of
the right answer for this question but

311
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,740
it's a question you have to think about

312
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,290
so what is the right answer for you so
you understand what youre optimizing for

313
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,210
like getting up

314
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,110
on I am curious how many

315
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,149
how many distros actually have
continuous integration setup probably

316
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,340
packages

317
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,269
which one

318
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,990
okay

319
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,250
suffered from the core packages on

320
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,870
I'm but almost none of them but that's
the way the yeah sure professional

321
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,879
software engineer

322
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,670
are working at a modern campaign which
most of them are not I

323
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,900
you have see I set up and every two
minutes after the belt on but we're not

324
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,940
doing that what this does

325
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,410
and we're not doing things like how many
have you heard of

326
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,330
continuous delivery acting as the point
ex-lax

327
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,730
are you doing it Wow

328
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,820
awesome great job guys that's that's

329
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,010
a good 25 percent to view who are doing
continuous delivery

330
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,420
um the most was on Jan of the best show
and this is one point where I am

331
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,540
actually very proud gently because we've
been shipping software users with an

332
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,100
hour for the past 10 years

333
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,340
um but we're not actually test and these
a

334
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,649
are the users are the testers I'm

335
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,660
and that and that's why they're called
beta straight I'm but we need to start

336
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,410
delivering software continuously

337
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,080
and and antacid so that they can get the
modern stuff but it also works

338
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,250
and we're not on

339
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,960
and so we've got you know all of these
different pockets matters

340
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,260
all over the place every language has
its own someone who does have like three

341
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,000
or four

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,010
I'm javaScript is a great example I mean
there's an p.m.

343
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,020
third power others jam I mean how many
different jobs for package managers do

344
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,860
you actually need

345
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,350
on and I guess we haven't gone to a
large enough number to answer that

346
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,010
question yet

347
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,480
but none of them talk to each other

348
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,490
ami we've got some more can a judge on
trying to integrate the stuff and say

349
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,820
hey let's slots download stuff from
Popeye and then generated right to be

350
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,689
built with that

351
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,830
I'm not going part of the way toward the
right answer

352
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,500
but I think I think the answer that we
need is that package managers need to

353
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,080
natively understand this stuff

354
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,970
i'm having a translator isn't good
enough I'm because people are

355
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,510
you know it's on the stuff all over the
place and especially a more modern

356
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,510
developers using things like you know
them

357
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,620
unlike Ruby on Rails on as much as we
don't want to talk about that here

358
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,330
because we're all the break and we love

359
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,409
I copyleft I'm dots not for people are
and that's what we need to build for

360
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,070
are and we're not we're doing a terrible
job at the stuff and so people and up

361
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,659
with you know five different copies does
the summer the lower level things

362
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,220
and note for example installed by by
five different package managers

363
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,320
and it's just not my ideal situation is
you never know what's using what

364
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,990
on the other phone with all kinds of
interesting issues I'm

365
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,220
and so what we do about that and and I
think that integration is going to be

366
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,920
the answer I'll you've got novel
developers today are using all kinds of

367
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,130
crazy data stores

368
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,660
I for the most part were still star
impact management and flat files

369
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,400
you know why are we keeping it in and
more credible way and more

370
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,560
reliable where than just sticking stuff
in a directory some are and and a buncha

371
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,389
text files

372
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,520
time and I got scrapped it all the time
and it creates all kinds problems

373
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,330
and I know some distros actually do but
a lot on down

374
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,250
and if you start things in a way that's
more friendly and more transparent to

375
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,640
the developers running list of

376
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,550
know happens lowers the barrier for them
to get involved on because the

377
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,600
the destroyer runs in a way that they
are you still working

378
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,428
and so they they're more likely to
become a destructive all producer

379
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:25,200
contributor

380
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,070
I because it's friendly to the way they
want to develop I'm and all these things

381
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,280
are packaged but

382
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,550
you know we're we don't we don't rely on
any of them

383
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm and there's a point to and I'm

384
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,899
I'm going to agree with the criticism
you wanna say I

385
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,050
that we shouldn't have to rely on the
stuff like why would you ever wanna get

386
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,060
a kiss and a cluster

387
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,810
up and running I'm just us all package
mister

388
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,030
you're right but the same time you have
to optimize for something and I don't

389
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,450
think that something should be

390
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,510
you know text files at the expensive
data consistency

391
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm not sure that's the right rate of I
am

392
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,678
note also siphoning out there in the
real world where we're not for the most

393
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,090
part except for the twenty-five some
rejecting us larry

394
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,730
I am people are doing all kinds attended
containers Asian right mean

395
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,400
virtualization isn't even

396
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,970
interesting anymore now it's gotta be
containers ish it's got to be alexi

397
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,660
on and you know fun front ends on top of
alexi I'm on top up for sure looks like

398
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,460
a sandbag

399
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,490
I everything is happening tanner's

400
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,020
on but none of us are doing anything
with containers may not not have the

401
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,770
this shows

402
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,530
to my knowledge I understand how to work
with containers are and saw anything

403
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,280
in containers I'm with I think

404
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,810
one exception on core OS

405
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,139
which is built around a doctor on and
that's

406
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,560
you know one other thing smother call
okay so you never have over and over

407
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,720
if I have time and I don't just run out

408
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,220
Africa cool I mean we need to start

409
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,560
taken a software that developers want to
use an optimizing for that

410
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,510
and said Oh attending destroys our thing
that like we figured out where they

411
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,800
should be in 1998 and is staying there

412
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,100
and that's what we have done and it's
and it's really a shame I'm nobody's

413
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,120
done a great job on the UI site for

414
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,620
for normal users I but before

415
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,280
developers and for technical people you
know even even I've kinda fallen short I

416
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,129
think

417
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,050
I'm so why for example are we able to
install

418
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,560
every a book at every single application
application stock into its own container

419
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,540
on and issues in a copy on right across
containers to Angela defenses

420
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,830
I why is it so tough to

421
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,418
on starter started to stir in the first
place just getting installed

422
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,640
why our shipping a bag and box

423
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,060
and that's that's what you wanted you
know and if you were kinda stirs

424
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,260
do you do you ship a valiant image

425
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,270
like a box which one

426
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:08,980
about it actual up so we've got the vast
majority covered

427
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,750
I unfortunately for the rest but for now
the fun too

428
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,760
I but nobody does anything with doctor

429
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,760
yeah and I know they said we're going to
support to the dude

430
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:29,600
right because we're open shift on passes
are awesome and

431
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,330
no ups and all that good stuff I'm

432
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,760
can you tell me more what is what is for
do with doctor and I'll tell that

433
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,370
everybody else

434
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:44,750
aka

435
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,570
in that conflict management are here
also know dr. be able to get in here

436
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,620
unfortunately I'll but perhaps a fun
video

437
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,000
so do all these things happening out
there in the real world

438
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,010
I'm and this is another example I

439
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,890
well to example on talk about wanna let
missus schott as a thing called on the

440
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,630
bus packaging

441
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,430
where what that is is bundle everything
up and ship it I'm

442
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,860
pretend the district doesn't exist
basically which means we have failed

443
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,879
time if they have to go that far

444
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,910
we have utterly failed in our purpose um

445
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,840
and our purpose should not just be jesse
is great perfect or is greater

446
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,220
ubuntu is great but when x is great I
mean and people in the real world after

447
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,020
on stuff across multiple distress but
we're not talking to each other enough

448
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,110
we come here once a month once a year
and do it and only

449
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,209
go home and and mostly done I've been on
this list the free to stop by or call

450
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,050
the distributions less for a number of
years

451
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,500
I I don't actually remember when the
last post was

452
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,460
so hopefully some %uh view all gone i
subscribe to answer clobbered hello mr.

453
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,000
if that was the only thing that happened
as a result of the socket be very happy

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,760
I'm so you know you've got shop doing
things

455
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,390
and just keeps coming up for an overly
the first pull the Pakistani side

456
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,850
screw package managers entirely words
going to do this ourselves

457
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,178
on but there's more and more companies
going that way

458
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,630
up shop in the first example it's not
the last example up to saying and and

459
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,450
they say on this because it's got
everything in it right the shipping tire

460
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,630
application stack all the way down to
and including Ruby itself

461
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,370
the not even using the system Ruby
installation I'm

462
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,080
we failed another example is FPM

463
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,678
I depending on who you talk to its then
search for

464
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,600
various levels or profanity I

465
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,439
with the second to being package
managers on

466
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,990
and that's all things were people in the
real world you have to build packages

467
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,740
and even want to integrate

468
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,770
are having such a hard time with that
that they had to write their own

469
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,610
solution

470
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,530
I'm to build back just in such a painful
experience and so what FBM does is

471
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,970
you on Pacha Tomball bill and saw it and
then on FB I'm gonna generate a tavern

472
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,710
rpm for

473
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,060
I'm because people have such a hard time
reading the stuff we made it too

474
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,669
difficult

475
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,410
we have a thought enough about the
barriers to entry

476
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,850
to creating a package because we've been
too focused on making expect perfect for

477
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,469
the experts

478
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,650
I'm and you know what else is happening
now

479
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,060
well we've got a lot of people food
don't even bother making releases they

480
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,830
don't even make a tag and get them to
say

481
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,580
to clone a from get having run it I'm
and this is a bank but

482
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,419
I see people shaking her head I'll

483
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,420
I don't like it you don't like it but
it's happening and so we have to deal

484
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,830
with it

485
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:41,449
people are doing this stuff again
because the experience is so painful

486
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,140
on what we optimizing for what's not
what developers why do today

487
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:51,200
I wanna optimizing for use a entry into
writing packages and creating packages

488
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,400
I wanna optimizing for people who need
to run stuff across mobile distros

489
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,890
or not optimizing for people who need to
do configuration management want to

490
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,040
configuration management at Corsica
betting text files integration files in

491
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,530
NC

492
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,800
but we need to you because the distrust
becoming irrelevant

493
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,340
there's there's a lot of people don't
care

494
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,629
and in fact it's nomnomnom

495
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,860
and I am very high Sam um it's it's
actually kinda embarrassing now because

496
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,699
Windows is doing a better job some other
stuff

497
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,700
when those package management has
finally reached the windows world

498
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,980
I just learned about this myself likes
six months ago these are winners package

499
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,600
managers

500
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,000
they all work they do stuff there are
repositories I

501
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,730
and that didn't that wasn't the case
yeah you know a couple of years ago

502
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,370
right there was like no go install
cygwin and then you can be some kinda

503
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,300
package management

504
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm by any other thing that when israel
has going for him

505
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,790
as they have really understand people
who like to click goods

506
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,629
they really deeply understand people
like to the point and click

507
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,000
and getting a good user experience and
once they're bringing out to the

508
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,870
developers are using this stuff I'll

509
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,489
that there's a good chance but they'll
get this problem some before we doing a

510
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,170
lax world

511
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,170
I'm

512
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,520
and so you know what kinda directions we
need to go put a few examples here

513
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,650
I'm if you actually know the story
behind them you know that

514
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,950
to have them are at some level based on
track your package manager

515
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm I'm kinda proud about the third in
the direction but I think everybody is

516
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,439
930

517
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,380
on the 31 I think there's actually talk
I'm XO at some point out it could all be

518
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,210
to check it out as a really really
interesting ideas

519
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,330
um in terms of where we need to go as
distrust

520
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,290
and so me know when the things like

521
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,670
hey everything's a famil are you don't
need to care about package managers or

522
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,780
you know as in any case or chrome
browser with we solve that for you say

523
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,050
to him to think about it

524
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,300
and we'll just keep all the data you can
tell us

525
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,570
everything I'm but Carlos is a very
interesting idea

526
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,679
on its it's super minimal system it's
designed for

527
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,710
the cloud I it's it's built using
portage which isn't his package manager

528
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,270
but nobody who knows who runs it knows
that because

529
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,530
inside up for us I'm a cigarette
packages you just use doctor

530
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,680
I'm and again it's all those things were
the SWAT developers want to actually do

531
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,010
they want to use things like doctor they
don't wanna care right package managers

532
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,629
on if you don't make a package manager
good experience for them they're going

533
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,520
to ignore it

534
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,030
and and go to start installing random
stuff in using chef on the bus

535
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,850
and and you not picking the language
level pack treasure perhaps

536
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,840
on I know this isn't something you have
to do its

537
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,090
it's not mandatory for distressed a
matter it's not mandatory for them to

538
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,639
succeed

539
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,020
I if they die it's okay nobody else is
going to care

540
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,810
but if you and I want to remain relevant

541
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,330
we have to keep up with these things
that are happening I am

542
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,710
yet one of one other is look what this
text I am Not sure if you can read it

543
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,120
but there's a ski Fraser those years
doctor as a package manager to build a

544
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,929
pusher ap

545
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,400
um Dockers not a package manager it you
know anything about finances

546
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,070
what you do is you write this this
doctor file scrapped

547
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,110
and in that strip the run something like
I

548
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,600
yum install XYZ and knots

549
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,429
the concept package management that's
not the way we think about it that's the

550
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,670
way people actually want to use it

551
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,540
they don't care about back to match what
they don't really care about

552
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,220
even about things like eventual
consistency my configuration management

553
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,860
does for you

554
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,100
um that's funny stuff up and running

555
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,230
I'm and andy is

556
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,900
you go check out all these if you
haven't yet because these are the kinds

557
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,540
of ideas that people want today

558
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,990
on the score of thing is just going nuts
people love it

559
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:53,220
because it works in the way people want
to work today only does things like

560
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,020
I oh and I use go of course it goes

561
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,879
I don't know if you for the efforts the
Chinese language ever Thompson snowed

562
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,670
on also you to use gas

563
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,910
they have this this sorta cluster and a
man using a router that maintains

564
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,140
consistency of configuration data across

565
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,380
at sea on every single insulation I

566
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,320
that's based on doctor and these are the
technologies people are interested in

567
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,280
using

568
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,690
people want to stop people so we need to
be there for them

569
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,560
otherwise there they're gonna pick
something else yeah

570
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,780
yeah and bundling is great and one
things that really can

571
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,899
that bus was haven't done yet I'm XO
estas which is really cool

572
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,580
is atomic upgrades and saw stuff some of
what the bed suddenly

573
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,870
everything's up that it wants and serve
breaking halfway through the process

574
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,070
because you

575
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,790
enough libraries the changing event
great everything depends on the

576
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,230
libraries that and we've done that
forever and we stop and fix that

577
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,750
I but they did and so it's not mandatory
for us to succeed

578
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,410
because they well I'm so what kinds of
things we actually need

579
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,770
I we need to understand bundling we need
to be able to have some kind of

580
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,280
insight into what's happening in silos
final so that we can agree with them and

581
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,660
understand was there

582
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,590
and understand if there are security
vulnerabilities and the 27th version is

583
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,850
the lab

584
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,610
I because that's what's happening out
there right people are bundling and

585
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,360
things like c11 like

586
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,479
a open as asylum and just name your
library and

587
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,060
it's being bundled so many times you
have no idea and that's not going to go

588
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,500
away

589
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,870
but will and so what we need to do is
responses to you understand those

590
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,389
bundles

591
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,710
and agree with those bottles and
integrate with the language level

592
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,040
package managers

593
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,780
and integrate with things like doctor
and things like that I grant on and some

594
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,520
distros are doing some about but

595
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,530
almost nobody is doing all it I'm

596
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,080
you know store data in ways that people
expect it to work

597
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,129
if you want to get more developers I'm
it's not necessary that your community

598
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,640
stay healthy or that a girl

599
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,410
it's fine I've attracts nobody else
gonna care I

600
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,340
I loved it you know any great was
configuration management why not

601
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,540
it's a better way to deal with soft I'll
warsaw doing at worst on this world

602
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,129
above past where

603
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,960
you know that server over there is is
named you know pretty

604
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,179
and you carefully and maintain it and
Gromit

605
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,790
and I can figure out and spend

606
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,210
II strong fluxbox up a long time ago

607
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,230
and how many hours do you think aspect
triggering my menus

608
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,760
you have no idea I

609
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,120
and that turns out I I decided I had
other things that the TV and decides to

610
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,219
run at my best. up in violence I just
installed know much about about it

611
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,469
time and now I run two applications a
terminal

612
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:48,009
and a web browser and I don't care about
what else is happening over there

613
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,879
I'm and so there's this this difference
in world fears bit

614
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,330
between you know the developers running
us and us

615
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,259
um and their concentric and work system
set a record need to think about

616
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,500
what's in the middle its applications
and that's where we need to make this

617
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,780
thinking about the application

618
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,090
the people want to use and Ron on and
and live there

619
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,240
instead of living in a systems all I'm

620
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,500
and I and maybe we'll all get along I'm
so I'm

621
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm about us five or ten minutes shorter

622
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,670
which is great because I hope to
generate some discussion I'm thanks for

623
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,190
your time and you can hit me up on IRC
or Twitter or

624
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,410
I one of my twenty different email
addresses or be like

625
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,839
we can take questions to yeah questions
now as well

626
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,820
of course thank you raise your hand if
you have a question of the United

627
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,820
its

628
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,140
anybody out that some I'll

629
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,799
for to way for data they would bring it
for the video I thank you

630
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,380
the so

631
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,500
how much time he spent looking at tools
like juju and open Sakhi

632
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,859
because they're designed to solve pretty
much exactly this problem

633
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,900
well yeah bridges is I don't know it
doesn't run anymore but I want you right

634
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,250
now

635
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,760
okay benefactors office because people
in the real world have to run

636
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,619
and deal with model this Russ that's jim
so maybe you can solve that problem

637
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,630
and I you know one thing that drives me
nuts about

638
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,050
suffer in general as a nation from I'm
and you know I I'm sure it would not be

639
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,460
a huge amount of effort to add multi
distress for juju

640
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,670
I the problem probably the biggest if
she would be getting

641
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,650
Mark Shuttleworth to say it's okay so
does soon take a look at OpenStack even

642
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,080
it's not distress percent on

643
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:55,080
be them

644
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,870
the classical algorithm

645
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,130
buzz so with the difficulties of

646
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,350
for packaging software the comes from
multiple sources is somewhere to play

647
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,180
some files

648
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,350
and where you at what are your thoughts
on the

649
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,940
the filesystem hierarchy standard and
what

650
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,050
this was to be doing about it abiding to
its owner

651
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,580
rethinking it I'll

652
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,600
I think FHS is great and i like it

653
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,870
handed it's another one of those things
that were I

654
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,069
you know at some point roughly ten years
ago people decided it was good enough

655
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,120
and I was mostly like to fall by the
wayside

656
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,580
I'm its kinda getting picked up again
it's useful to have

657
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,430
the site kinda those things like
consistency it's actually surprisingly

658
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,649
hard to parse and figure out where your
spot but something even after reading at

659
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,660
I'll and in fact that's part of our our
equipment Co three developers a striking

660
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,279
out like

661
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,910
which subdirectory of our are you
actually supposed to put certain things

662
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,379
and

663
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,170
I and its it's not as as clear as you
would like it to be

664
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,290
um but its it's definitely something
that's useful

665
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,180
that chance here we have a head insofar
as we feel like it makes sense

666
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,230
or is up to date with current standards
but the problem of these things like you

667
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,760
know governor in 10 years ago and

668
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,950
have had very few changes since I'm

669
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,470
Argonauts place I think it's been picked
up again I hope because some are

670
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,890
I'll feels great I you know what's gonna
happen with a is

671
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:29,210
nobody who's not a disorder of her lover
read it are not the problem we need to

672
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,710
build

673
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,980
tools would encourage the right behavior
rather than writing long documents that

674
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,150
tell you for a beer

675
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,400
some other some other saddam hearing is
really developers are the problem

676
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,450
i mean but now developers are never the
problem users are never the problem it's

677
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,520
always your fault

678
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,290
it's always my fault but good we're
doing it wrong I hate to use the devil

679
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:49,570
to

680
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,340
advocate freeze but a lot of the things
that developers don't want to do

681
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,790
is because they want to treat your
operating system is their own little

682
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,750
playground

683
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,670
and assume that nothing else but their
application exists

684
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,100
which is one of the things that is
problematic

685
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,370
yeah but I mean

686
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,880
you know the fact the latter as these
these are the users looking to do

687
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,200
whatever they feel like doing

688
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,710
I'm it is a matter what we want them to
do I

689
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,720
there's gonna go I'm you know keep
running Mongo in blazing date or

690
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,240
whatever

691
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,560
well want to look too well the problems
that we have is that there's actually

692
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,570
there to be

693
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,120
completely different in many cases
categories abusers

694
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,490
dads blurring little with some the dev
up stuff but you got the user's what the

695
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,419
developers who are who want to build
with all this latest technology they

696
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,950
wanna do whatever's in a package
management for that system and they

697
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,060
wanted and then when I get out there and
I quickly

698
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,180
but then you also have the I have the
other side of the equation which is the

699
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,020
deployer ce

700
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,480
and although they are almost entirely
distinct

701
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,070
in my AI in the real world right now
you've got mail you know the the United

702
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,500
okay

703
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,290
it before we keep going with %uh some
sort it out I'm I was like I can slide

704
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,200
sure about this exact topic a in the
stock

705
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,450
three days ago in London so go check it
out I well

706
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,839
Bob bed the my point is that in the real
world you know

707
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,290
months ago are you have these cool
technologies that you might be able to

708
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,040
use but

709
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,830
if you want to put them into a business
where you you know you where it's going

710
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,750
to be the end the

711
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,570
in the difference between making a
million dollars in losing a million

712
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,870
dollars in an in

713
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:23,770
stock changer trades for example a fly
by night bundle that package with a with

714
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,020
a

715
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,220
with known vulnerabilities is not an
acceptable deployment scenario

716
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,720
and so that's a place where the
destroyers are much better at it but we

717
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,790
can convince the deboer

718
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,259
the developers are there not producing
something the people that

719
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,840
can be deployed to Ackley right yeah

720
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,840
I'm irate goodbye thank you

721
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,030
boo

722
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,170
quite so at the touch is stolen last
month her

723
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:00,190
as developer to all I do I care about my
security updates from PacSun it's a

724
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,060
doctor so

725
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,310
I shut my Kona slow bubble and it's got
a bunch of dependencies within a bubble

726
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,770
but then as you say there's to security
issue though classes so I don't want my

727
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,040
and users to be

728
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,180
Colo by that their data exposed just
because

729
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,560
I didn't care about package management
so here is a developer would I do with

730
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,259
that right

731
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,590
I and thats in a common interest in
quandary is that

732
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:27,330
people care but you know what what's
been happening is that a lot more of the

733
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,520
effort has been thrust upon the users
rather than the

734
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,520
creators on the software I mean

735
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,280
there's a lot of upstream is nowadays
that aren't even bothering to issue

736
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,230
security

737
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,950
I releases on our security issues though
you know commit time and temperature to

738
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,779
release but they're all

739
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,130
be any you know sort of working with the

740
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,780
search or what have you the to do other
stuff you have time for one more

741
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:59,780
the

742
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,690
dunno how can me to distributions helper
to feed those containers

743
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm

744
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,930
I I think its you know after some other
things that I brought up which is

745
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,529
you know and and dismay distributions
thing that's been served writers thing

746
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,360
for a long time

747
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,150
so I'm not sure if russia specifically
asked for that reason

748
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,280
I thank you for that great marketing
opportunity I'm

749
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,020
but now it's yeah people are looking for
a certain level flexibility and there

750
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,710
are two different things that pertain
urs results either containers

751
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,550
I and you know most of the testers are
not good at being installed inside a

752
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,880
container right now

753
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,190
I and so you know what other things that
chance you &I a number of OSX package

754
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,020
managers do

755
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,770
is light US all things into a prefix we
don't need the full system

756
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,259
I'm just need a certain level or answer
you cannot patch management

757
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,730
even on a system that doesn't care I I
think that the and wanted to be and BS

758
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,590
the things might do the same thing I'm
not sure

759
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,650
but this being older you know how the
user

760
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,420
who has package management in your home
directory time and that's that's an

761
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,610
important direction

762
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,230
I'm not because that's a an interest in
his case in itself

763
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,040
but because it deals with other use
cases like like the doctor thank

764
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm so you can get some level package
management within every single container

765
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,380
this could help for security updates to
yeah

766
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,930
agree so you should always check to UK

767
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:38,930
I alright thanks for coming everybody
really appreciate it well

768
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:48,010
way

769
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,660
Cup

770
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,990
to

771
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,580
