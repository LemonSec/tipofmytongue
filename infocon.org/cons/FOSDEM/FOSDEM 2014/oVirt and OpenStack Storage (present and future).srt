1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,000
I my name is for their income

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,589
and I'm working for other in the all
weird storage

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,980
I group and

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,780
I'm here to present here the current
integration between

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,090
over here and OpenStack storage so

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,180
the presentation is

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,460
months about are the integration between
over to an

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,179
OpenStack but I will give you I short
introduction about

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,170
overtime opus fact just two get you
started on what the are

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,040
up then I'll go over the present

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,149
current up integration so what what

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,610
we have today we the overt

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,320
bang glance integration always seem to
star in the side I

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,250
importing exporting less humid yes and
current limitation

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,789
and then I'll go over the what we will
have in the future

16
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,520
I am with a glance future integration

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,890
are new things that we can add an
improved their

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,430
of Keystone out indication I

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,810
I'm how that is also involved the week
us

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,030
storage is somehow all we have done the
same their integration

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,360
in there coming future so

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,979
just the start what is

23
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,729
all year this is the definition that you
can find around pretty much everywhere

24
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,210
already is the virtualization management
application that manages harbor no in

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:35,939
storage

26
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,110
and network resources i ng

27
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,689
your data center in order to deploy
ripple machines

28
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,148
I I its open-source really is on there
the Prince of

29
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,079
the party a license and this is a quite

30
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,199
all diagram that you come fine but

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,710
nothing like we have some new things
going on but the

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,570
be this pretty much the idea we have and

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,729
to different web interfaces

34
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,920
up the administration portal and the
user portal 2

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,060
interact with it I arrest ATI

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,680
them JBoss application that is the
engine that controls

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,060
beam the that the center's and then on

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,190
each node of the cluster you have BDSM
that takes care of controlling those

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,099
know it's an

40
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,819
make damn I well available and usable
from the engine

41
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,819
to manage basically everything from
storage is

42
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,339
network at anything that the real time
machine would mean

43
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,830
to actually run I am

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,230
what these OpenStack our

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,429
with cloud computing project that
provides an and Infrastructure as a

46
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,080
Service

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,629
and also control SEL large pools of
compute storage and networking resources

48
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,530
Apache License II governed by I

49
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,069
for a nation that was established in
September 2000 poll

50
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,720
I'll there might be

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,030
some overlap in the two projects I'm
they are

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,269
Taylor for different workloads saw today
makes sense to make

53
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,250
them leaving together in the same I
infrastructure

54
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,519
so that is why we need to integrate them

55
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,019
I I won't go much further into the front
seats but

56
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,239
I because the time is really limited

57
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,110
so need is the 80 S O the present time
you need some interaction between the

58
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,720
two

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,709
and a.m. well as a co-pastor

60
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,260
can be can have three different areas of
project

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,989
I compute networking and storage we will
focus on

62
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,049
storage obviously be in the scope of
this presentation

63
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,560
and more specifically we'll look at
glens

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,810
and how that can benefit I

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,950
in the integration with order right

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,599
so what is glance glance provides
services for discovering reducing and

67
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,629
retreating

68
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:12,179
year to a machine images right I has a
RESTful API

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,819
for quoting p.m. in this method is an

70
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,180
actually downloading that the image I
become

71
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,320
be these images can be thought as I

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,340
template if you're familiar with that
concept in over

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,349
I am can also be used as backup and has
different

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,270
backhands eventually like ranging from
the simple places them to

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,099
swift I it supports several

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,060
masks for months and containers for
months

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,259
a this for months as Rococo and eyes I'm
container for matters bear and graph

78
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,380
you're probably familiar with these a
few already is also

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,110
or your I

80
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,350
it supports he manage

81
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,110
meta-data I basically these

82
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,919
some these are some additional
information that you can have

83
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,870
on the images that are stored in glance
on

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,270
you come pretty much go over them
yourself team

85
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,740
die I'm just mention two of them because
they're

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,949
kind of important in the integration I

87
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,389
one is the size decide has to be

88
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,060
intended as the real size of the image
of the file that is transfer

89
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,070
uploaded or download it from that and
the starters

90
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,590
I am does a special status that is key
with the

91
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,070
and it is when you have the method is
that it is raining

92
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,259
glance but the image is not there yet
guess these are important for the

93
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,720
integration so

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,490
I the year

95
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,910
we also have I some

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,110
I additional properties that are now

97
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,600
are more standardizing push into

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
about the I some addition permission but
the images

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,389
as the architecture I the hypervisor
type and some other information

100
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,949
I we decided not to use these common
properties to store

101
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,169
or via specific information a be because
we wanted to actually

102
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,909
have of full integration with a
OpenStack so

103
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,180
a that information wouldn't have been
cock of consumable by

104
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,050
I by OpenStack so we are not storing any
additional

105
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,639
up properties in glass for now

106
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,840
I so the interesting use cases for all
the earth that can be

107
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,758
I that we wanted to integrate with

108
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,990
are importing exporting single images

109
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,919
or templates from and two plans right
for the interoperability with OpenStack

110
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,008
I'll we can be used for

111
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,199
I backups of images I'll yams

112
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,539
and I basically also use it

113
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,289
as I saw are the main 22 all day

114
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,740
over to something specific that is
called I said the main stir

115
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,550
on their use to store I the images for
the

116
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,509
for the for the VM's but the we can

117
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,340
try to think I to leverage plants also
for that

118
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,719
I and then the final goal that is really
a mission is to import and export

119
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,590
I'll full VM some and templates

120
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,770
supporting complete young définition
multiple the sky

121
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,440
and snapshots I so for the

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,210
initial phase we just focus on the first
arm

123
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,239
find here which is importing exporting
single images

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,340
and basically I

125
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,840
that that integration has being honored

126
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,008
I I implemented using something that
came along

127
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,060
I in over 33 I they're called external
provider so

128
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,919
in over 33 we introduce the concept of
external providers

129
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,549
that our I well services that we

130
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,620
are able to understand and integrate
with

131
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,099
right and and basically both

132
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,919
OpenStack the magic lantern network a
and also for men

133
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,419
has been like they have been integrated
as

134
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,690
I external providers in or via

135
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,279
right so we have a new tab in the year
well these is the weather meaning you I

136
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,260
and this is where you can add a new
works on providers

137
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,849
and the issue be this whole

138
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,550
it looks like when you have glance I
integration

139
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,449
here so BM

140
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,630
blair's I external provider

141
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,760
when you define it high up several feels
that you have to

142
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,010
feeling I'll Name Description The

143
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,519
you are out of the service and the
authentication right you can also test

144
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,279
the

145
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,160
the connection that find these desperate
be is pretty much get you started with

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,660
it

147
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,100
and I as soon as you the these

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,580
external provider a glance external
provider you will

149
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,620
also find a new our storage domain in
the storage tub

150
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,519
I that he is exactly the class to mean
that you just

151
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,019
added and they are somewhat special

152
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,830
up they basically are unattached

153
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,370
to a storage pool up until now we always
had

154
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,209
started to me is that we're on attached
to our

155
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,649
certain that the center right on in this
case there

156
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,269
they're not attached to any specific
that the center and you can use them

157
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,930
52 I import and export images between

158
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,079
I different that the center's

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,070
I am 3 for some operation that we do

160
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,430
from the Ovi of perspective I

161
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,599
we needed to interface with Tom open
stock services

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,100
but open stock provides a at the moment
on

163
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,890
only 00 by some bindings for that and
engine

164
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,230
in all that is written in Java so we
also started contributing

165
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,380
to a Best Actor SDK as a means of
communication between the

166
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,310
and Jean and be in the OpenStack
services

167
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,300
I we pride to stabilize it and add

168
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,459
%uh so the support for things that we

169
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,649
needed I'll so we can

170
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,640
diver in one of the operation that we
are actually

171
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,550
I worm into Syrian I into me

172
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,140
in the integration basically and

173
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,329
the less image discovery right so we
want to lease the images that are

174
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,310
provided by the plans

175
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,459
I a service

176
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,500
and basically when you select the

177
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,930
plans I towards the main in the UI

178
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,209
you will p prompt to it on

179
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,380
the you will have a least of images that
are available or

180
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,550
that you can access from that class the
main

181
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,479
I what happens behind the scene is a

182
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,140
is engine that the is the overt engine a
ghost

183
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,920
Keystone to request the authentication
get token

184
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,510
and then goes to glance be bless
provider external provider that to you

185
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,100
defined earlier to get the image
released there some

186
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,170
kind of passion involved here and then

187
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,899
eats displayed in the UI I

188
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,399
has a show with you before arm

189
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,480
so once he listed his images that are
available in

190
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,730
I in the class service you probably want
to import

191
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,510
them so what he do you can select one of
the image

192
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,540
and you can basically click the New
button that is

193
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,079
import and what happened see is that the

194
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,050
you will be prompted to be done I love
where you can select

195
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,359
what that the center two years and in

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,170
which domain you want the image to be
imported to an

197
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,160
what quarter two years for that you
mention

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,290
and what happens behind the scene

199
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,750
is engine again going to he stunned to
work with the talk and

200
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,240
I it goes in price and discovers the

201
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,350
image meta data to glance so that the

202
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,120
can create I the internal representation
of these

203
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,820
images inside the engine

204
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,269
and the after we have that there are a
presentation of the ETA of the images

205
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,649
had the engine

206
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,730
we go and issue with comments to be some

207
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,079
to create a new volume so that's the
container where are we will store the

208
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,760
image

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,839
and then we will you should download
image I

210
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,920
that we'll start the that the transfer
from

211
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,229
blast with this so we do some will go to
class and download the image data into

212
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,800
the volume that we just create

213
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,979
are so there's a special K's I'll wear

214
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,019
basically what blast

215
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,040
the improvised here was DDD

216
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,430
the image we're taught size I so as I
said before basically

217
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,899
what lansky view is the size of the
image

218
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,970
these means that you are not able to
discover in advance

219
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,800
how large how big is the he is the image
wanna see attach it to the

220
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,829
the am right so are how large is the
disc that to the VM will see

221
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:51,380
on these is needed for I

222
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,860
the internal data representation that we
keep

223
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,760
of the skin side the engine so we also
need this information

224
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,970
and at the moment what we do is we go
and downloaded the

225
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,829
initial part of the image and we
discovered akiko Heather

226
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,750
and we peak for the year tall size of
the disc

227
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,990
I so

228
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,589
best my provide some additional
information about the brutal size in the

229
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,519
future but these basically works also
for regular HTTP

230
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,540
so disease a

231
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,250
more compatible just we I also

232
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,490
other HTTP servers that are serving an
image

233
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,380
and we'll see liter I'll that we can
support also that

234
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,800
arm how these in part to the

235
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,209
image will look singing in

236
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,589
in all there to it's basically I have
can be found in their

237
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,690
discs a tab and basically the meta-data
easement

238
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,519
tame most of it and then some other

239
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,459
a information are forged with the false
like for example the interface that is

240
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,719
here for you

241
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,019
and a basically at that point you can

242
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,459
create a VM on it or create a template
in 34 we are committed to process so it

243
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:15,888
can be imported the right away as a
template

244
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:19,639
I and so

245
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,190
so at this point we can also look at the
other I

246
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,660
I the other well operation that these up

247
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,800
a symmetrical to these are these
exporting discs to glance

248
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,689
I it's pretty much the opposite so now
you go to the desktop

249
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,209
and select on one of the disks and

250
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:44,279
you can export them I asked what glanced
storage domain

251
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,259
are you will be prompted give prompted
again with a dialogue where you can

252
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,600
select the glass the main

253
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,430
I and that behind-the-scene will

254
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,899
pretty much do the same and didn't go to
c'est un

255
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,320
and well it will cue the emerged as I
mentioned before basically we prepare or

256
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,649
commit it about the image

257
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,680
in glance but the real upload is done by
the same

258
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,839
I in fact the engine sensor and upload
the image

259
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
I request to be some that dan streams
the data from

260
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
the volume I that we have in

261
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,940
our shirts towards into

262
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,470
I am glance these will look like as a

263
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,199
regular image I am some of them into the
ties maintain like the name for example

264
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,709
iron and basically these

265
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,229
he is based on the BDSM support for

266
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,639
sharing images I that is as been added

267
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,709
specifically for glance but it can be
leveraged for

268
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,170
other on metals of transfer

269
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,939
of images and one so we have to tune
your

270
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,850
API's are that we use I am

271
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,250
in BDSM years that are download the
image and upload image

272
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,289
and we can he should be friend to

273
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,359
methods for the a transfer

274
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,990
and one of the easiest HTTP that is the
one that is

275
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,730
use for the a for plants right and we
can also specify

276
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,240
to additional had the earth a to it

277
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,730
I so well as I said in these way we can
support both for a glance

278
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,740
right and also for all the other HTTP
Server

279
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,309
arm their ass and other special K's

280
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,580
in now that we have to calmer

281
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,350
that he is when we download an image
that the skew call

282
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,928
on a blocked the main I so these is

283
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,679
team provisioning means that we create
volumes that are

284
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,750
well on block the means for use as p.m.
and we create volumes that are

285
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,280
of not entirely largess the you're close
eyes

286
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,039
of the year of the image we just created
them with chunks

287
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,620
then are extended I as we

288
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,799
as the VM start using it I E 52

289
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,270
implement basically came from using on
block block devices

290
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,559
I so what happens he is that the volume
that

291
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,649
is created is just probably one you buy

292
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,350
I'll in size and what happens is that
BDSM

293
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,860
has to go to the HTTP Server

294
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,059
or glance and download

295
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,320
and peak for the in this case the actual
size

296
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,010
of the file that will be transferred and

297
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,530
it will extend the volume today correct
size

298
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,428
before downloading it

299
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,630
arm in those in

300
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,820
all these mechanisms we have

301
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,280
few limitations I we are at the moment

302
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,010
limited to I not being able to export
the images sweet multiple volumes

303
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,230
and these means that we cannot export
disc that have a snapshot or that their

304
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,250
babies

305
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,980
teen provisions on a template

306
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,400
and this is because basically we want to
export

307
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,820
one one image that these fall contained

308
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,809
while we are using external snapshot for
volumes right and

309
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:30,789
and so it means that we if we want to
explore

310
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,020
be is a these images we would have to
collapse them but I have one slight

311
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,620
about that later

312
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,760
on there is no live

313
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,500
VM disk es por I was in the PM should be
down

314
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,240
I but uploading templates is always
possible

315
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,320
I the snow sparseness apart on five
domains for all four months

316
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,520
a the images are always predicated I

317
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,700
means that we are not punching holes in
zeros

318
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,880
in Syria so 0 at the moment so we don't
know them

319
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,010
arm obviously compression with the

320
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,580
what would help in this case I am

321
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,010
and we can not raise the room op partial
download of the image

322
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,799
I so we are moving now to the future

323
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,080
and you fight

324
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,520
these are there any ideas for the future
improvements of plans hah

325
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,168
weekend add a few simple operations like
deleting it

326
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,780
images I chain online squash that is

327
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,000
what I was the speaking about so up

328
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,690
support these two that have a snapshot I
upload the image compression

329
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,480
to save band with and also supports
sparseness probably

330
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,700
I am a well

331
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,549
integrated upload and download via web
dominios apart though so you can upload

332
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,320
you matisse or download images from your
desktop car

333
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,189
and they will be streamed a into the
volume

334
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,820
I as I mentioned earlier store

335
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,870
I see images seen glance and use them
that you lean I am

336
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,260
of your as eyes at the mains basically
and

337
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,820
import and export will be a some
template so arm

338
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,289
just few words about these questions
squashing I and compression of our

339
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,360
of from multiple volumes images that we
have

340
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,879
in of your saw as we see here we have

341
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,090
an image that has to snatch up

342
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,610
and basically the bass volume can be
either raw or

343
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,030
you call it doesn't matter but snapshots
one is that shit to

344
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,370
are to to call volumes and

345
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,719
in order to basically is

346
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,250
I squash the emergency just the latest
version we have to compute

347
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,710
there a mop of the clusters that are
scattered around the s3

348
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,240
a volumes and there will be a the
support for these in kennel

349
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,809
think im image right it will give us
some up blocks

350
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,418
I that are Scott there on in in this
volumes

351
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:19,789
and then we will read them sequentially
and

352
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,770
after buff rising then we can compress
them and stream them

353
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,370
so this is just one of the Dr on how to
deal

354
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,110
with the problem without using some
additional space where we

355
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,139
I basically store the

356
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,730
the image a just for the upload

357
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,510
I other improvements

358
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,110
in the era of Keystone are

359
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,899
well in all your 34

360
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,350
are we to do some larger factoring
authentication and directory services

361
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,629
authentication you see you at the a day

362
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,320
defended the of the user and that
directory service provides a

363
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,620
I setup information about the user Pisa

364
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,219
been big deal pick up all the so now you
can use them up

365
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,270
mixing and matching basically you can
use the cover us

366
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,340
authentication with the other up
directory service if you want to or any

367
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,039
other communication

368
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,140
I'll and Keystone

369
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,350
the batista no indication as been
sketched

370
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,500
as one of these the back and about to

371
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,669
II the moment we have patches upstream

372
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,830
and if anyone once to

373
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,299
contribute or take them and finish them

374
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:40,900
is welcome to submit is the current
status and

375
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,710
a will probably have it in the future
somehow

376
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,710
arm be interesting use cases for these
integration is that we can

377
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,720
consolidate yet indication keystone for

378
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,929
both that the center's overturn opens to

379
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:02,320
now weekend also associate Keystone user
some tenants to all we're two entities

380
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,840
and

381
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,389
well basically the specific purpose
Mission Santa roles to objects that we

382
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,900
have

383
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,409
in all the earth like a a VM sore images
or the sky

384
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,630
and reuse the same Keystone identity is
when we are interfacing with the is the

385
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,039
we the services with your best tax
services

386
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,610
arm so this is probably how it will look
like

387
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,049
I am ok indication was too pissed on and

388
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:33,059
you will be granted the ISS the access
to the I

389
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:37,158
web part on the skids for this picture
but to the REST API or

390
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,020
anything and then supposedly later on
you can go to the service is serious

391
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,720
reusing

392
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,870
those art indication credentials and

393
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,770
the token problem and other service that

394
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,279
in the storage area that we want to
integrate sweetie is the

395
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,900
arson seen their service that provides
basically

396
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,210
and infrastructure for managing volumes
I

397
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,200
scenes well since for some big because
previously it was part of

398
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,539
on of the compute node of Nova

399
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:13,330
now since for some has been I'm
separating to our

400
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,740
specific project itself that is seen
there

401
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,190
and volumes are persistent or even right
block storage devices that

402
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,200
I'll must company are you

403
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,370
through ice cuts right now we have some
other that are

404
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,799
slightly different for example glasser a
fast that

405
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,080
are attached as a shared a as a
sheriff's

406
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,980
a are mounted action is share

407
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,760
volumes so and um

408
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,559
they have a life cycle that is
independent from the VM he says he is so

409
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,450
you can create

410
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,600
the items that are using the is the
these volumes hand destroy them

411
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,770
and create other near the cities that
are using it but

412
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,889
they are the coupled by arm

413
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,990
supports a snapshot and the snapshot can
be used for new volumes

414
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,440
and backups are generally archived in
innings with

415
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,320
arm the US kissing over too well

416
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,360
week we can think of thing for of
importing and exporting images

417
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,240
francine there but probably the most
interesting one is sharing sing the

418
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,880
volumes for inter beat me

419
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,370
for the interoperability with opus %ah
and in that way we we will leverage

420
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,049
the seeing their volume drivers that
they have that

421
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,820
for the support of storage appliances
for IBM that up

422
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,408
a hardware though UMC and D&D is weight
gain

423
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,970
also the storage offloading capabilities
that are coming with the

424
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,870
seen their volumes and we can also think

425
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,500
to unify snapshot I'm backup strategies
in your data center also gain

426
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,100
for both all your 10 OpenStack probably

427
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,629
I 1

428
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,490
part of the integration would be to I'll

429
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,760
again going to kiss them for that
indication

430
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,700
do some simple operation like least in
creating and deleting Williamson

431
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,760
in seeing their and

432
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,809
later on I'll when we actually want to
use them

433
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,029
I we will arm after we

434
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:29,470
created or year well identify the
volumes that that we want to use we

435
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,470
to with some over to be an

436
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,220
we will issue we will either set up the
connection

437
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,049
or create a VM wheel and bad some way of

438
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:47,049
connecting to the realz while Cody
storage that is provided by scene there

439
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,220
sub is pretty much what I'll

440
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,880
I'll we are planning as future
integration with OpenStack

441
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,159
I i want to mention that we also have a
talk tomorrow about networking

442
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,230
integration between or beard and open
stock networking so

443
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,409
up that we complete the picture on

444
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:15,370
and the I have useful links for you a
mailing list that if you're interested

445
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,039
in

446
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,908
I that's working progress of having
blast soviet-built or

447
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:23,539
as our equity 34 images that

448
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,990
you could start downloading yourself or
your

449
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,140
or your a a in South right a

450
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,700
so basically we will have images of

451
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,960
the most important distribution there
and you will be able to

452
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,059
from from your installation to download
these templates

453
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,730
are using glance

454
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,730
any question

455
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:03,590
us are wait for the mic Ando

456
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,530
hi hello you think the integration with
an old book

457
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,420
take time we are planning it for a

458
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,810
I'll the

459
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,909
all the order for release seems to be

460
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,600
are so that

461
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,350
pretty much the time frame the

462
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,709
overlooked for release and that from
friction and center for example colts

463
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,470
and a backup

464
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,000
are you trying to going to support such
things I

465
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,520
we have not specific details exactly of

466
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,540
how much of that work so basically how
much time you have

467
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,550
not much them so

468
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,590
written basically the needed the problem
and integration with to

469
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,830
a seeing their is that we have

470
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,939
many flows of I complex

471
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,920
arm operation that we do on storage that
are

472
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,260
a specific to all the earth like for
example

473
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,740
I live snapshots or Alive stars
migrations

474
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,110
these are in the current implementation
re:

475
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,169
tailored to how the meeting of holding
images hearth

476
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,230
for the Miss storage and how the look
like

477
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,530
in over your right and all these flows
my

478
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,240
they dumb up it all

479
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,520
the scene so and easy integration

480
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,940
we think there would be to leverage what
we have

481
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,730
already today that are direct lines so
we already support direct line

482
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,630
a and we have some operations there that

483
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,730
we support but that the easiest
integration

484
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,680
so you basically can you sing their
volumes has that it plans

485
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,580
for that use this one for all the other
complex flows people are

486
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,760
lifetime are definitely

487
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,760
thank you up

488
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,430
okay

489
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,120
or go through /url the release 4.0 is it
related to

490
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,550
Red Hat Linux some or those the
schedules mezzo

491
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:34,550
already the love to speak publicly about
that up

492
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,190
yes support money good word

493
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:45,070
3.5 actually so as using in pl7 holes
for a 70 percent 07

494
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,659
as a hostess plan for or 3.5 forty
engine itself to run

495
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,740
probably will take a bit more time the
interesting part is probably

496
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,400
using it as a host what

497
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,700
the can we expert the thats learned

498
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,700
read that way like just beware you do a
lot of back port in line with the

499
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,130
criminal stuff like that with that we
got some pictures from the photo to

500
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,410
those who release

501
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,790
back border to the actual loretta
package

502
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:21,190
of overt a

503
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,440
the we usually it's it's not an issue so
much for over dole Rev which is the

504
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,280
the rather version of it because we
usually we base each minor version so we

505
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,590
don't

506
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,050
have to do a lot of back ports for
features was at the back

507
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,210
course of course the police Asian and we
doing a lot of them

508
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,440
in upstream overt as well well just
abhorred Frieda Frieda free

509
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,480
no stabilization with these for the
current overtly so

510
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,200
a lot of back or so the move upstream
and downstream

511
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:55,200
thats

512
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,610
too far say I don't know the schedule
stop

513
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,679
up

514
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,610
I joined a bit late but the

515
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,659
I miss the the thing about the local
integration and all those things but

516
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,890
um I've got a lot of customers which

517
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,580
I'll still love blystone beat me up but
which'll still running

518
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,409
Yellowpages move through miss which 00
plane

519
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,540
UNIX use a back and without any

520
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,649
held up integration we got did some 20
POSIX

521
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,620
calls on that to extend the the
possibilities of groupings and stuff

522
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,100
like that

523
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,969
is there any integration plan for just
simple

524
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,160
UNIX use a back hence which OMB the
extent it's a

525
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,160
regarding pose a good articles

526
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,760
you can't use

527
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,639
a as a local mentioned there's a a lot
organ refactoring of indication back and

528
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,000
you can write a plugin for anything now
basically

529
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
so old
