1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,140
I'm going to talk to you about
specializing healthy with huge

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,079
I'm inspired by the Humane systems
movement

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,849
to Tokyo via a this

4
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,570
talked about her taking a look at the
Colts

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,169
and understanding goes and make
decisions about cults

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:24,910
well tools we need to make

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,329
don't decisions based on real

8
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,550
from values not just

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,329
ideas

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,129
built-in don't use in all plan which
prosperity

11
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:42,399
popular when even the XP first about

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,860
in math 95 and

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,970
today's what's called a lifelong which
some it

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,430
own wish as much used to build lots of

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,620
each client application form all kinds
when the before it was widely used to

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,649
before the bench came out she and

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,040
is no largely been replaced by sharp
systems

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,790
yeah systems and and

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,450
think on mol/l but they're still malls

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,450
of all system where things have to be
done

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,650
whose is in the engineering environments

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,830
based on feingold and large

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,160
official ice cold a large qipao search

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,298
a.m.

25
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,229
at home it's something we pursued

26
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,590
discovered by me

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,649
it had to do conversion of Mexico whole
system

28
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,250
with to get another out and

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,890
we know the stats week and movie fast

30
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,500
bills

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,120
willing to help us with that gonna make

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,220
visualizations where NC what's happening
with that

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,270
we can thank you these

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,380
and cease and we can yes

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,330
couch very fast where we can just

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,370
Luke to the gold in unless you have

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,920
but this is my about sixty also change
also piece about

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,630
between them and atlanta called and
helps us take a look

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,380
at some aspect of the people will die
for we had to analyze

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,049
mean that's why I V the but was found

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,130
much and because

42
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,230
the before I warburtons affability
background we decided that we wanted to

43
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,988
apply this to don't be too so

44
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,319
who why do we think we need to visualize
'em

45
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,480
we think that we need to quite much
denser information

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,510
then we can by just taking a look at Dec
scheme

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,370
the we you feel a need to look at
multiple dimensions at the same time

48
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,750
not just the from the mention the

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,850
files units to class to

50
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,910
methods and and we need to local health
is to a chilling

51
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:16,910
and like they didn't systems

52
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,840
home

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,879
people this sheepish both success
provide information

54
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,630
and

55
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,290
bottom is visible

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,870
we have been working with us launch
systems assistant which are

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,680
several thousands K lines Colts and

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,010
if the starch working with them then its

59
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,319
clear that just leaving all that called
smoke on the scale

60
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,569
and I'll look a likes

61
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:51,859
repeating it

62
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,010
takes work weeks and most the

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,709
we won to be able to move the see where
we are

64
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,280
and find between should change within
days

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,310
for much faster and I'm

66
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,190
we tend to find the logic programs

67
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,650
because well program's goal as they are
usually and don't think I'll

68
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,200
this seventy-years-old I'm

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,250
the small programs

70
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,050
a we know what we're finding healthy
because they were all and not play

71
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,460
that's

72
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,460
that's easy bombs are in the larger
programs

73
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,180
well so what we mean when we say we can
like denmark's information

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,260
well we have the pictures like this

75
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,700
piracy is big :love: files and me see
you

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,719
police file which would've file is a
step dancing

77
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,740
I'm we

78
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,110
trying to get some more information
there show we give them a call or

79
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,280
and you say that the white ones are many
small files

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,940
and and like once although

81
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,810
Leverone are larger files and we see
here that's

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,850
I'm human brain I

83
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,860
very takers my or and

84
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,540
me knows about loss

85
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,120
which are the files we had missing from
this system

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,320
so that's and easy way to show

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,320
where in front homes

88
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,249
you can also who might know you over
enormous amount of

89
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:45,339
information this is Steven 50001

90
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,709
goes this is filesystem lemme

91
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:53,800
and Manuel the do you mean take a look
at it and move their

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,580
media's few things which are King

93
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,369
investing this Barclays the big picture

94
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:07,039
that's right stance the

95
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,830
effecting positive notes parts which is
very secular

96
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,699
qualifiers are very complex haii

97
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,319
something wrong I'm debts

98
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:26,319
the the highest power is more which is a
fairly complex class

99
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,979
when I look at growth 'em

100
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,970
which is large

101
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,000
maybe complex absolutely seemed

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
cell wall large in terms of Elijah gold

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,430
class was a.m. that still most makes it
clear to me

104
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,370
problem from if that goes never changes

105
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,660
or its book of news

106
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,680
that might be a problem 'em

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,000
if they only have one measurements

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,550
the mentioned where I'm looking at this
coats then I cannot say

109
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,780
if its a problem I always have to look
multiple dimensions

110
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,289
the to find outs

111
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,540
mood if this really is a poem I'm

112
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,290
of course logic call to this more of a
full moon

113
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,230
a I'm but not necessarily a the

114
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:40,000
the lovable chrome

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,170
a good example for to Indo P ish

116
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,720
virtual to the specialties is a nice
switches

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,350
bones them which is doing it

118
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,800
or in the news pic it can do lots of
things

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,480
so it's very large when performing too
much force

120
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,620
a conspiracy 38 99

121
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,950
and this is a one-point people

122
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,820
the in the nation only charts

123
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,570
complex and

124
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,680
if I want to know if I and shoots be
using these

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,770
components a just knowing that his large

126
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,770
doesn't help you much

127
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,870
I think in the newsgroup to CES to many
books she bore the only school bones

128
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,039
I am you know you signed up for this
project and how many people are

129
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,069
a maintaining then I guess a better
ideal

130
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,180
if this is a problem

131
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,849
I'm com

132
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,959
so just looking at the funding and
dimension

133
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,349
size doesn't help me I need to do
something else and

134
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,709
what kind of think they need to measure
a

135
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,279
that depends on the kind problems my
house

136
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,920
this use building projects where the
Shome

137
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,628
forms which did official components and
for thats

138
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,439
a we totally for four different

139
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:23,349
the measurements we are showing that
shoulder

140
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,870
in Hamptons soul this whom

141
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,220
this form is based on that one and

142
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,980
all 154 a.m.

143
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,800
business thing shows that I reform
passes from methods

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,890
a the court tells me something about the
complexity of those members

145
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,720
and mmm behind law

146
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,180
doesn't hold a large addition the I have
purple

147
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,630
last post: this is a difficult Lt poem

148
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,490
in filthy people come rides camp and
much directly

149
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,860
in the forms so we see you there that
happen

150
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,600
and we see that did not have immediate

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,540
you blocks to the left which are that we
have

152
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,449
little complexity if the complexity is
white or yellow gold and it probably

153
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,339
means that

154
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,310
they only had ago arts they're saying
when the French be difficult

155
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,479
and then the they delegated to the model

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,410
a what should happen when that's

157
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,319
event so little button was clicked and

158
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,540
dumb idea carts dummy that's

159
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,029
a on something could happen if some
permissions Group and and that's

160
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,350
watching most like year it's about

161
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,759
underlines Colts doing something lots of
things

162
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,490
which makes it difficult to change this
culture

163
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,660
so the best the did

164
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,079
cycle mother complexity cycle nothing

165
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,939
psychometric complexity a in cases

166
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:11,199
with loops with expense

167
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,180
so if you have them that they would will
be washington and

168
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,010
normally group form called in Delphia
supposed to only test

169
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,080
at the beginning if you have some mile a

170
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,620
guards which should be cool and then
mention just

171
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:34,620
ask mojo pic to do those things

172
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,680
home

173
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,099
this is of course only in person for
cold where we need to make changes

174
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,060
issued Cisco switches not going to
change and you're just got to do shit

175
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,020
like this

176
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,850
for the next twenty years stem I'm not
talking about this column:

177
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,950
but normally we need to talk to you
requirements the need to be able to move

178
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,180
to new platforms

179
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,310
and because needs to be open

180
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,209
tomb

181
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,309
developers you have to the place

182
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:16,179
people all the time indicate a filthy

183
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,930
woman path local although style building
which has to move to

184
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,529
modems that old LP where there was no
holes

185
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,970
like the PCL and it's mom by along P

186
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,360
the database support changed a few times

187
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,820
im the different versions and that means
gold

188
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,070
the dad makes versions bill feasible
mobile

189
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,260
and Osman think me everywhere thats

190
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,880
remove home a on-scene 64 bits and you

191
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,810
gold called

192
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,540
so you only analyzed go

193
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,829
cool or you also do

194
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,750
reviewing them the we are currently at
them

195
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,769
point where we have fled to analysts
analysts

196
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,839
working and aren't can really moving
towards

197
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,640
the effect export the study

198
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,840
them so when we find don't project in

199
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,000
the most important things we have to do
with golden shell switch our

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,360
in dependable the version of the coast
is the more implication

201
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,920
moving you can pump from the main yes
and

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,990
make sure that you unit Dennis and
rational

203
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,990
dictum them

204
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,980
to have better maintainability I'm

205
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,270
for migration support we you took a look
at so that work

206
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,170
that's and television while parcels a
the victims

207
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,189
it's much to see a

208
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,560
they will paper where they show that
includes

209
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,569
my a 1.5 million lime stealthy

210
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,810
goats project tool shark

211
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,949
in about eighteen months with four
people which is about 10 times better

212
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,150
done we would expect if you just who was
he quantum

213
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,550
so we are looking at copying that

214
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,949
rescue

215
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,800
good who now concedes went

216
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm we do

217
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,380
you

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,059
a

219
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:48,740
so we have a moves mobile come

220
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,740
final

221
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,290
then she doesn't touch parking cool and
lemme

222
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,990
this very small sample

223
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,360
for the name of so weak and ready to
compete for the station

224
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,670
to see you what's of these go to your
williams then

225
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,349
a.m.

226
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,560
are believed to be still think far so
the

227
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,290
to make it possible to import this we
wanted to see which units we could meet

228
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,089
how important is the am beginning to
understand

229
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,360
so you can see that the beam

230
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,260
finals are

231
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,899
well thats known people part is the
interface so

232
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,930
in interface via small loss tells us

233
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,620
weeks but how many boxes there are I'm

234
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,320
below that there may be a a

235
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,490
and implementation a botnet and Mimi
going trials for the months which we

236
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,139
find well thats also shown him

237
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,740
and find and the reference I don't we
have personnel ish

238
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,769
the which are to be expected because he
did not

239
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,329
you find any of the if they're

240
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,160
goes which should mmm switch between

241
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,399
for instance the Windows and Linux
support

242
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,420
so that would be things that will parse

243
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,439
stop full

244
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,010
the fam I'm soul

245
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,840
if you take a look at this then we can
see

246
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,660
thats weekend conform such boom

247
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,120
and yeah this same this is the same
picture I'm

248
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,240
but this is a very simple one so we have
only one

249
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,880
form depending on the inheriting from
the form

250
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,839
and it has to leave in templates which
are simple just nice

251
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,990
I'm unlike

252
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,990
in the little project I'm

253
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:27,089
shop

254
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,450
if you now take a look at discourse
which is

255
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,240
archivist then you can see dads

256
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,800
this visualization helps us navigate

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,560
to cold to be go to very fast so this
weekend at this yellow

258
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,940
method that's this method

259
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,190
and we can see this the complex yes

260
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:57,190
and more very high but this

261
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,890
still about a month to month we want in
the correct one

262
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,428
we can see that we have %um if statement

263
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,860
and four statement and

264
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,969
thats supposed to be more complex again

265
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,789
can we should have

266
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:29,720
that matter

267
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,220
home

268
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,220
the classes

269
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,750
and here we see a dependencies at the
unit level

270
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,860
and we see for each units

271
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,510
and size of the closest where

272
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,780
the number of Metis peace

273
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,780
in the was on pole the nation

274
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,129
and move last goldschmidt collection

275
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,690
I'm

276
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,510
me

277
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,900
to make these kinds of for the pictures

278
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
they are mostly about lines Coast

279
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,900
I'm so we often make a lot of them
before we find something more

280
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,280
which helps to show something
interesting

281
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,320
show I'm this force what I want to show

282
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,439
own Opus One more PTO thats the park's
your

283
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm you

284
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,250
this is the part which get to work on my
machine at home but

285
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,380
more I'm

286
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,059
home this little

287
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,899
show that something old thanks a

288
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:14,809
we can not only do two-dimensional
pictures with an organ

289
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,710
you mentioned once this is the picture
we show before

290
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,350
and when you mention or you'll

291
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,009
the whole system no them and we can

292
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,430
moved who dat

293
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,490
thank you that select elements and

294
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:39,490
also a show something about those things

295
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,140
and

296
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,670
and we also these injustices the her
last week

297
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,400
mention doomed make think I'm

298
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,760
pictures for

299
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I don't people be exported to

300
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:18,370
Sony become the same model

301
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,150
it's a culture mobile where and BK

302
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,760
blocks I'm

303
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,090
you and little

304
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,039
show YouTube it

305
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,850
from handful

306
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,658
measurements we have told up to 20 and

307
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,480
like this feel them show limbs picture
the

308
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,830
it's not just the icons to show because
you don't see to anything interesting

309
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,820
home that's mostly because you don't

310
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,820
after I measures for them

311
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,860
from

312
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,070
group

313

and making but no this

316
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,590
use something which make-work mostly so
important thing mother

317
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,929
I was able to create buildings and make
them

318
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,320
muscles

319
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,290
yeah

320
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,220
