I they needed to know anything else and
it shows her

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,050
and being mean to her legacy case it's a
hideous

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,850
encryption secure turning to our they
want to see any to explain how it works

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,408
so I can't they seen as helping with a
somewhat have want to see right

23
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,690
pain raise your hands to okay

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,080
and even wish introduction to how it
works and then explaining

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,490
have been how they be much how this on
this

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,699
a lot of this stuff so he said what is a
good way to explain and predict

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,240
the

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,920
and that thing going on for a like Eman
mean when I hear

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,579
and this basically a

30
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,538
Asia said if they just a maybe I S and I
had a lock

31
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:54,729
is essential to maybe I say and they
will need to access

32
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,689
a input/output on your own you know and
laptop

33
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,538
or anger system without and I think if
anything us

34
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,350
if you think about other products that
are accessed next guy but more hangouts

35
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,869
are

36
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,869
like any other property system US
usually

37
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,250
his rehab integrate with other other
stuff is sometimes you have to install a

38
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,080
the kind of guy had a certification is
in talking Caller and

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,000
gonna hang out it's a trap and

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,260
the dead Monday to bring something that
and they're awesome I want to say is

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,768
that

42
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,709
yes is somewhat everywhere you turn into
and be aware of lame

43
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,140
beating your application from one to the
system's and

44
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,630
and make us me be clear on the Russia
and the Russian takes care of it

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,010
misled baby up they have structured
their and

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,970
and offer and it's been a big fan of
boxing really fast

47
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,840
in the last few months eighteen-hour you
have one saying that shapes on Chrome

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,110
on pop Rox and come from droid

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,250
on Fifa crime rate a opera

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,989
and then you have also like and bindings
need to binding to go into something

51
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:02,459
like

52
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,510
is what she claimed the run from the
owner and a conduit up

53
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,350
assist like almost everywhere

54
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,400
square metre dis and then this morning
does this place have set up just maybe

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,910
ice

56
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,000
then you hear access doing the device
ESN you are and

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,080
15 so they say the laptop then

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,100
camera and the microphone then

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,109
that another said okay into communique

60
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,800
with remote peer directly from your
broker and you got an arbitrator

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,480
with using a different one the
substructures and

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,690
dish 3 and KK basically

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,609
the mainstream what s for art and media

64
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,720
and disintegration and eight ish I'll

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
the mainstream it's just discov

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,819
ucks got actually good news and media
and when he gets here he say

67
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,129
she can I sell me of a and

68
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:01,010
you can use to share this you when you
call navigate today's media

69
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,828
when you get back into mainstream of a
cover-up and

70
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,709
you owe a.m. microphone Seacrest

71
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,920
and you gotta bust

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,230
constraints I can buy her assertion you
want everyone with her solutions

73
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,949
if you wanna if you are like a.m. when I
stopped actually for animal iPhone you

74
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,370
can shift what can I want to use

75
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,090
such a and disappear connection

76
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,440
its this guy isn't kind of like the main
component on the

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,349
on their own party and they have stocks
here from a low of

78
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,900
other stuff ASA the homeless thing the
processing fee

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,520
the from encoding for media

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,820
and Antonio the collection use

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,120
I royalty-free and open source think

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,610
a bowling ball the company yesterday an
EPA and then they

83
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,690
they'd really feel funny and

84
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,900
how the security to each

85
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,929
with the communication between each pair
a saying eighth and bankrupted

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,340
they exchanged and fingerprints when you
think a link and in that time

87
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,969
mother in a minute and violence but but
with management and

88
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,470
you thinking how it looks like I think
they're a simple when you you have

89
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,449
making a call about where you can say
when

90
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,580
when I get remote stream that if it me
or are they a and then you can do

91
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,380
something with a conviction to nitpick
annual event i knooooow

92
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,110
page so the same thing with your local
stream

93
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,590
and the new country of us to the highest
like then did open description you have

94
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,969
to

95
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,240
someone else and then you have

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,080
RTC they the tunnel that once you have
established this connection between your

97
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,690
dish about us and it appears and you can
send

98
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,610
you can't read this day the child days
to send Jeff arbitrator

99
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,560
and this kind of need a facelift

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,610
the same at about seven in the face of a
condition methodist

101
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,159
and he won isn't really went in DTS

102
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,699
and and you can change me try one on
reliable data

103
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,340
that means it's kind of like to see me a
PHS if you want to every message I'm you

104
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,039
connect just

105
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,010
mean day in with this coming a few them
and

106
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,710
to the signaling you one US

107
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,310
did the way to establish a connection
between the two peers

108
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,729
in a way to upon them to discover each
other

109
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,539
and that's causing nothing in the
wenatchee

110
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:31,680
a world and missing you too well says
when talk to someone like central Sarah

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,710
that would have been discovered each
other and

112
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,380
idea say that actually the signaling ish

113
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,289
ish compagnia abstract ended the way you
can exchange them

114
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,380
so you can use anything you want this
this club have been here ever since he

115
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,690
missing anything to me and indicate a
famous saying is what ok its and then

116
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,229
both partners connector thing and
seventy exchange

117
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,400
did the singling but you can use an
accident into guys in a second pp

118
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,138
and then you can just like this Aloha
any chance to break and then exchanged a

119
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,130
session descriptions

120
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,139
me through the day and

121
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,159
for a single in terror and then they
would establish did internet connection

122
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:13,669
between them

123
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,089
there

124
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,050
they said nothing to you new texting you
really have a way to discover this

125
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,440
the two pairs but you put into goes
behind through not

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,490
so pro you had asked me to be like in a
pile and there were some time

127
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,409
say the Internet I C which is a
component of the

128
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,570
about 20 and

129
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,529
making the two services covered each
other they're using this time protocol

130
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,130
with had seven they make a in the
session description this information

131
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,630
about

132
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,670
the

133
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,040
a just this time address about how on a
controversial not

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,980
from one side to the other and if that
fails then they

135
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,720
you don't have I don't shop and relay
server that

136
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,850
in has to be public some of partners
have to be able to reach it

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,020
and the gun they're going to share and

are wit a marsh

161
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,189
the eighth that's why her condition and
the like to happen in this has a good

162
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:48,189
person system that works for the way
what they say it's over for today

163
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:52,569
what's up its hella need to set aside
and then

164
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:56,229
16 there's a connection bitch I and the
media stream

165
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,939
are actually appear to be from Robert
Russell dead-on didn't go through their

166
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:03,309
through a thorough the and then you can
I say

167
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:06,629
and like China tendras and it's kind of
like the

168
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,649
compressing assistant in Cheney showed

169
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,759
buying in a much smaller and a much
simpler way the

170
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,680
place so basically a

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,949
here everyone he's going to taint each
other

172
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,969
nice

173
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,050
for each page

174
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,459
each of the participants going to each
other no center so that a section

175
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,279
relating everything

176
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,639
the frame with a fifth day if many
people joins this

177
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,680
you're probably crash this action any
mediation right now but you can for I

178
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,319
have the lake

179
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,729
a participant's know what I'm not and

180
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,899
not leave the room so you can comment

181
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,149
they say you're a say you can go and try
it

182
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,929
think now and and Dakota

183
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,540
that had nothing to do with the bench
with a he'd have me or I'll if you want

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,279
together and nina Star

185
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,249
that'd be much has been some talk it has
some extremely different lol

186
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,920
and mayor framework that he do party sex
crime

187
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,849
5 message but I think it's a trap they
and the front and the back in this a

188
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,949
career a small

189
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,359
make us know anything about this test
message box in between there them

190
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,649
what's on the client's everything else
isbn-10:

191
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,100
and a client-side and a segment on top
of backbone

192
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,569
a turn on JavaScript different occasion
that I chose

193
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,479
treat everything you say all the time
but actually a slip base

194
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,509
uses every of which is an all the per se
they select relevant education so you

195
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,230
can use any

196
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,670
anything you want really and

197
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,990
you want to start and we want to see or

198
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,860
try and start building stuff the same
really interesting protectionism and

199
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,689
reference I

200
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:59,949
from balloon Jess RC and and they have
the screen a useful

201
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:04,339
about the JS which is definite it a
point to fill in for like

202
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,069
that some of the day APIs actually
namespace with

203
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,750
there they cannot say that most I'm
saying here it's a child what get

204
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,860
and without the JS you have a good
concise

205
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,549
and a went in he said and the

206
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,779
going to have a guest on several you can
use you have to play like

207
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,389
you know you can use made it public
stance however the they have available

208
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:30,139
and then having in relation to but scant

209
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,639
if you want to do something about being
this

210
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,110
in chrome comes with when watching tell
us which is

211
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,240
and

212
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,760
better process and you didn't think he
would have been about

213
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,139
the everything going to watch a very
detailed information about a

214
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,220
the connection to track and then snapped
some really cool a British

215
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,550
new party know a few of them annisten
what Cheney

216

from the AM that front okay I'll

217
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't think very nice airy going to
start building something the top of

218
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,160
it would see this link be the best the
filling station

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,480
testis yes they had a surprise because
you can't just establish the data

220
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,959
channel

221
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,199
with fellow they mean another stream so
you can use it to share files can't

222
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:15,649
appear

223
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,180
in the process you can take try and
rectify that into about when they will

224
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,680
be sent to the remote peer

225
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,019
