1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,580
of Spee be done winder she's community
marketing manager hard to remember to be

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,070
when she will explain Roger should be an
open source program program checked

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,620
mess up your talents

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,619
hey everybody call me a call the

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,190
good

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,980
goals

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,530
watcha

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,950
good can you hear me now yeah

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,780
it alright so I'm here to talk to you
about why you should be an open source

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,630
project are essentially open sourcing
your level

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,770
life yourself and your self development
so my name is Carol Wong

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,160
I work at monte de be on the community
marketing team and before that I was

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,889
working

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,450
in higher education organizing student
groups and actually be for that I was

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,540
studying psychology and I was doing some
research into self control of which is

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,870
how you view yourself in relation to
yourself and others so

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,319
concern all about the lenses there which
we view our lives on

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,589
and like any self-obsessed let you know
as soon as I got to my twenty years

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,900
later I was spending a lot of time
thinking about

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,750
how to be happy and how to reach the
next step my development

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,830
and I realize after working in open
source for a little bit that I could

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,890
take the framework seven open source
project

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,200
and apply that to my life so when I
first announced on Twitter that I was

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,190
doing this talk

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,030
I'm somebody actually asked me why I
said open source project and set up an

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,280
open-source percent and I thought about
it

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,869
and it was really just because it's six
of one half a dozen another because

28
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:36,630
people

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,229
are packed your collection of code say
about your initial commit your parents

30
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,610
depending on how much you believe in
nature versus nurture you got a very

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,460
level in this

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,298
you got the park less severe childhood
influences that you can see their

33
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,210
rejected or accepted on your behalf

34
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,798
this is probably coaches teachers is
here childhood friends

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,200
and now you've got you your write-up
project and you still have people I need

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,950
to change

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,430
the only difference now is that you're
in charge of that and said if your

38
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,130
parents

39
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,570
so how do you decide what the next
version if he is going to look like

40
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,410
how do you picture how do you develop so
I

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,859
comment feature projects is rationing
and you probably heard me say this

42
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,190
earlier when I asked what is the next
version if he was going to what is the

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,320
next version if he's going to look like

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,640
and what does this really mean it wall

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,380
it means that you are a work in progress
well all works in progress there is no

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,769
end point of being perfect just like
there's never an end point after

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,690
software project in perfect you're not
done just because he's

48
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,159
got the next version and sometimes we
think they're

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,709
life is going to be perfect once we get
that dream job wants to move to Paris

50
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,390
once we meet

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,329
perfect percent the development
self-development

52
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,030
is a lifelong process your wants and
needs are going to change and evolve

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,069
just like

54
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,470
your friends are your significant others
are going to change and evolve

55
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,409
so how do you figure out a way to go on
well

56
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,450
you for reading out just like any other
project and here is just an example or

57
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,760
read about the years

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,359
it happens to me what I got from our
Director of Training and Development

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,760
so it has all the different aspects of
your life at least my life that I'm

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,700
trying to think about

61
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,238
and Minnesota roughly half the time line
there which I'd like to try to do things

62
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,970
it out next month isn't too soon it's
not so far away that I'm just gonna

63
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,840
forget about it

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,500
and if I look at this right now to
decide to start selling it and I'm like

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,120
I maybe I'd like to start running an
hour twice a week and that's going to be

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
virginian 0277

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,030
and then maybe also iraq to do my taxes
cuz that's due in April

68
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,299
but then maybe I also want to
international night how Akamai mom once

69
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,049
a week on a visit my friend in DC

70
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,069
do I get my own apartment and

71
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,238
calm down yeah you can do all this at
once and you don't want to show your

72
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,739
features at once just because you can
work on everything at the same time

73
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,060
so you create a more realistic right
yeah

74
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,409
for some things out of a slightly
different versions you know I talk to us

75
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,260
about my mom

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,000
and just like with any other read
Matthew

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,599
share this with people and you're gonna
get feedback from now on I

78
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,790
and Harry Redknapp is a good thing just
because richer

79
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,980
research has shown that people who have
a roadmap how to have your future down

80
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,510
the line

81
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,980
even if you don't end up meeting any of
these goals just having a plan in mind

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,970
having a sense of where you're going

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,300
is actually enormously helpful so say I
shared this with some of my friends and

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,010
I'm like this is the kind of thing that
I tried

85
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,140
wanna try to do and you're gonna get
some feedback community feedback is an

86
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,580
essential part of any open source
project

87
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,560
also maybe my friends gonna tell me it's
really hard to renew my day to try to

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,370
run an hour twice a week so I know

89
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,060
haircut that under 15s four times a week
and it may be a talk to my DC friend and

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,490
she's like oh I've really missed you
since I've moved away

91
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,600
but I don't know visiting is essentially
the most on the easiest way to do that

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,570
and I'm really busy why don't we just
try to talk a little bit more often

93
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,639
a few tell my mom I'm gonna call her
once a week

94
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,880
she already expected that I was gonna
call once a week that I'm gonna get a

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
lot more grief now I don't get

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,409
so accountability is also really good
thing for this

97
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,660
but you always have these decisions to
make on what you can and should manage

98
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,979
this is your internal rights and this is
really just to help you

99
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,440
allocate your resources the same thing
as it does in any developments this

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,380
helps to allocate your mentor your
physical and your emotional resources

101
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,210
and so how do you do this one other
feature

102
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,330
comment another feature a a successful
open source projects

103
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,698
is having a comment all that's something
that you for sure need to have and the

104
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,020
future of officers projects to stay

105
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,299
something community-driven as they are
as you need to have a strong leader you

106
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,620
have

107
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,960
due to a person or a body of people who
are in charge of development

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,489
and fortunately for you this is you and
offer these cases

109
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,780
your goal is to make you happy here and
you're the person that should be in

110
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,630
charge of this

111
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,330
now another wonderful problems about
well today actually is that

112
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,979
you her me whatever you want where

113
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,979
okay nominally is a living in a country
where you have the freedom to do so

114
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,500
you can pretty much become anything
realistically

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,639
you can he anything so surprisingly my
aging parents really want me to become a

116
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,430
doctor

117
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,910
that's a big surprise right and as a
challenge immigrants who've given up

118
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,090
everything to move to a new country

119
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,049
I had a lot of pressure to it to do this
I'm not somebody who likes chemistry

120
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,449
I don't like things that I can't see and
I like sweet

121
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,940
a lot well a lot more pressure to accept
this pull request this change on my

122
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,669
being

123
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,289
on myself and on my way but as you can
probably guess I decided not to go to

124
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,310
medical school

125
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,000
I declined at Park West on me I was an
adult at that point and I was a choice

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,690
that I want to make

127
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,210
this second you change for somebody else

128
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,169
is the second that you saw about your
project and you've lost your call

129
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,669
said also I but sometimes people believe
that you can be better version of

130
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:56,240
yourself

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,259
and this is an opportunity to better
yourself so I started taking French in

132
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,000
high school

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,410
in the states you don't start taking a
language in talks far too late to be an

134
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,370
NES

135
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,639
I and I had a French teacher in college
you

136
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,330
notice that was really get her course
and encourage me to challenge myself and

137
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,500
take some hard classes

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,080
when I always kinda like language as I
thought I was pretty good

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,419
I'm so I became so many quite decided
was gonna take harder French classes

140
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,830
and that led to be studying abroad in
France and then part of why I'm here

141
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,940
today is because I could negotiate with
the bakery in Brussels for some cupcakes

142
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,180
TS they'll be cupcakes in a single day
from tomorrow

143
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,449
so that's a simple Park West and that
was a good one for me and my gal myself

144
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,870
I became somebody was going to challenge
myself language as I became somebody who

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,400
was going to hopefully be good at it

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,489
so the main point here is that you're in
control here in control whether or not

147
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,509
you wanna make a decision that's going
to change who you are

148
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,169
and simply making that shift in thinking
that understanding that you have mastery

149
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,109
over the events in your life for all

150
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,490
is one of the most highly correlated
factors for happiness but you'll notice

151
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,889
that both these examples require knowing
something about myself

152
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,280
see that I didn't like chemistry but I
love sleep too much

153
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,878
day didn't like being a workaholic when
I could probably do pretty well

154
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,139
languages so how do you figure this out

155
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,600
now

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,180
slow the need to know your internals

157
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,860
this is starting to knowing both your
weaknesses in your strengths tell your

158
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,230
bugs in your features

159
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,480
so personally micromanagement is
something that

160
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,690
annoys me a lot I've snapped a couple
managers because of it

161
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,280
but if you think about that it's really
time a self-starter

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,890
I don't need a lot of hand-holding I
don't need a lot of Management he pretty

163
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,150
much can't tell me what you want to do
and I'll have my own schedule I'll have

164
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,120
a timetable I'll tell you what I need

165
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,430
and giving us trust them getting it done
so my point of view being a self-starter

166
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,839
being an independent worker

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,460
that's a feature that how do you figure
out what these things are

168
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,720
while you share your dolls and aspire
this is scary

169
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
because sharing yourself genuinely with
other people

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,500
is a very very scary and a hard thing to
do but people want to help

171
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,050
unfortunately in the real world they're
generally a little bit nicer than they

172
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,680
are in the internets

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,760
so when I first started my job done on a
TV a little while ago

174
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,850
I was scared because I got into an
interesting point in my career

175
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,580
development

176
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,980
or I couldn't pretend to be somebody
that I was in anymore

177
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,310
getting my first job in getting somebody
gave me some they do like the idea

178
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,969
sure that sounds great it's a wonderful
idea but at this point I simply

179
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,160
could not pretend to give a shit about
things I did not actually give a shit

180
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,420
about

181
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,390
and the was scary but it was also
liberating at the same time

182
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,620
and this is a good state to me and this
is the same state here and when you're

183
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,440
with your oldest friends are your close
family and that's when you get into

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,120
those conversations about what you may
be really like to do but are afraid to

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,700
when you're struggling with what you
don't know how to do so I can mention I

186
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,360
work on the community marketing team

187
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,930
part of what I do is I help engineers
together talk proposals for conferences

188
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,209
and my job is fairly mystifying to a lot
of my high school friends lot of

189
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,390
homework untac

190
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,199
and I explain to them that after a
couple of months in doing this

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,510
helping them with their proposals I was
feeling kinda like I tried because

192
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,910
i'd never stopping at a conference i'd
never submitted to a conference

193
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,730
I never even been on the speaker side of
things at all and the

194
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,920
they asked me why not you know why
haven't you done that

195
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,660
and they have the wonderful perspective
that I was too close to see which is

196
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,030
that

197
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,130
I could speak at a conference to know
that's not just something that I was

198
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,320
helping other people do

199
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,280
and so estimate and carrie Ann but

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,040
and part of what I'm trying to do here
is in China redistribute collaboratively

201
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,730
that's one of the key features of an
open source has a few share out your

202
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,580
features you shout your development

203
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,810
you share them back out into the
community even if they're just a

204
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,150
variation on something that somebody
else's talk about I mentioned earlier

205
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,329
that I decided not to go to med school

206
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,570
actually ultimately decided not to go to
graduate school at all

207
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,710
action worked in higher education for a
while and that completely turned me off

208
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,970
going to graduate school

209
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,830
and I share my thoughts on that's what a
lot of my friends and I was coming from

210
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,030
a background of having worked in higher
ed

211
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,400
and I recognize that my perspective in
my answer it's not the Holy Grail on its

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,880
not the

213
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,230
one answer for everything but it was
hard for the summer than just understand

214
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,580
maybe fly I was making that particular
decision

215
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,670
and maybe somebody else had a really
good reasons on why they didn't go to

216
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,329
med school

217
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,410
and their coach is all wrong it's just
different Terry project develops

218
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,060
differently

219
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,939
and you're not trying to compete with
other projects you can draw inspiration

220
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,280
and you can draw ideas you can draw
support from them

221
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,380
my friend who went to med school he
makes decisions based on how much it

222
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,550
helps other people

223
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,990
his side and long life is thinking this
decision this thing that I'm going there

224
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,380
is going to help somebody else further
on down the line

225
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,560
and that maybe it's not exactly the way
that I think and maybe is not exactly

226
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,719
the way you think

227
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,680
but you can I could incorporate that
into myself and incorporate that into my

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,540
and no I want to help engineers

229
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,760
think about things that their passion
about to people who care and want to

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,950
hear what they have to say

231
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,320
that's finding a community for them and
community is key for an open source

232
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,500
project a fresh

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,040
and ischemic for us we know the
community makes us feel happier and

234
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,300
healthier having a social support their

235
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,420
is often one of the most important
things either just recovering from a

236
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,099
heart attack

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,550
or just feeling happy in your life and
people often when I'm working with

238
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,250
engineers on top proposals feel like
they don't have anything important to

239
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,740
say

240
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,330
when no worse case scenario that
somebody else's artie said something

241
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:36,910
similar

242
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,780
you still have a unique perspective in
background that nobody else does

243
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,970
that's worth sharing and somebody else
may learn from it

244
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,380
you know that's why we have conferences
that's why we're all here

245
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,780
so while you could certainly be a close
source project that never changes unless

246
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,699
there's profit for somebody else

247
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,090
that never lets people see who you are
because maybe you're afraid of what they

248
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,700
trying to its

249
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,120
kill why would you be if but

250
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,120
which is open source he'll be happier go

251
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,380
gone

252
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,380
the Brazil while the box after connects
this summer some question forums

253
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,579
the

254
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,450
gone

255
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,500
you wanna chat more about this there's a
Kennedy president their

256
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,270
3 gone
