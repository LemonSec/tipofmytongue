1
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,060
I think everyone settled in you jump in
here

2
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm mine is just the bonds at work in
the until open source technology center

3
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,440
with but then it was just presented an
several others

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,270
who were were here today on the another
team graphics are primarily in

5
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,449
miscellaneous other GP related stuff
inside Intel

6
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,540
but today I'll be talking about

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,550
I'm then tell better platform and I
actually want to come with us last year

8
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,520
but I only got approval to talk about
anything in any detail

9
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,060
this year so push forward I'm so

10
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,680
some this may not be a totally new to
you especially if you've been reviewing

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,130
but

12
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,130
what came out IVF a couple months ago on
Bay Trail but

13
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,280
I'm this is something I'm really excited
about because it's a

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,729
it's a a new src for us

15
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,380
um in a couple ways it's gotta I'm a new
Cebu

16
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,490
I'm resigned I'm CPU and a a

17
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,940
and new GP relative to our previous src

18
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,200
products sows it's a it's really
interesting and we've also been involved

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,790
on

20
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,960
on the the bring up and some other
design work from very early on the open

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,110
source anything so it's

22
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,750
that's exciting for us from my
perspective as well wasn't just totally

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,479
driven by

24
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,739
when the stuff or or Howard on solely
with windows that sort of thing

25
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,230
so you may like I said this is a I'm

26
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,890
a new src I'm specifically focus that
like the tablet market

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,380
and convertible market I'm not

28
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,720
it's not designed to go into phones

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,930
doesn't quite have the the power
envelope that you need for that in love

30
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,600
with immigration in for that but it does
make a previous a tablet chip

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,510
its working arts five-dollar are 22
nanometer process which isn't hard

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,579
bleeding edge which is the the bottle
stuff that we're pushing out now that's

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,709
on 14 and Amir

34
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,470
but are 22 nanometer process is pretty
good its it's premature and

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm works well for us there really big I
mean

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,920
its a really big change both you and
your viewers for us

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,250
on the SRC sidon on the other side I'm
and like I said the elec stuff was

38
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,950
was a priority from early on and the Lex
team

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,980
has been involved up you know are open
source

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,160
team doing 1x drivers has been a ball
from very early on we record

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,870
power on the silicon first came back for
the factories doing the initial

42
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,200
debugging development

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,190
over for driver stack so band who may be
some around here was at that

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,530
can grant to use on the Mesa team was
there

45
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,030
helping and I'm we got you know three
games up and running and stuff within a

46
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,500
day

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
were to have getting stable silicon so
that was really exciting

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,190
I so it's on the slides you may think
that is a really pretty how did you come

49
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,620
up with those well I didn't know

50
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,500
these mostly stolen from idea so
hopefully there will be two

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,120
24 marketing stuff but BR the whole
world is the overall architecture the

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,340
the chip so it's it is an associate
gotta watch my PB

53
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,000
blocks on it but the big changes are the
new

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,160
Adam up two quad-core and then the new

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,940
HD graphics which is I'm not new from
the client side it's basically an Ivy

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Bridge graphics part

57
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,109
but it's been shot down and put onto the
SRC

58
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,109
so if you're familiar or if you've been
following our

59
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,310
our previous out and stuff you know that
I'm

60
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,660
earlier chips used the IP block from the
machination

61
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,159
the PBR graphic stuff and I'm sure
everyone has a lot of love

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,090
for their for their stuff from no be sad
to see it go but now we've got Jan

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,049
graphics and stand

64
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,669
to have to tolerate that I

65
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,810
and then you know it's going kinda
similar feature set to what you'd see on

66
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,760
a client parking others the CPU

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,020
and graphics power sharing and you know
the

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,130
syncsort ice extensions for security and
virtualization

69
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,199
that sort of thing is all is all present
so it's

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,410
you know it looks like a regular client
CPU and actually has some more speed

71
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,520
so like I said these are Kentucky the
key changes so

72
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,150
the big be one on the Cebu side is going
to the cinema architecture

73
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,570
I'm which I'll talk about the second and
the graphics are going from the SGX

74
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,889
I'm running at at a lower frequency to
the

75
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,730
to the Jackrabbits winning a higher
frequency of course is that only but

76
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,950
rather a model to the summer

77
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,810
deferred rendering the for tile baseman
minutes its immediate

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm resolutions increased in fact

79
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,310
we go up on the next time we go pilot
wifi best 16

80
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,700
thanks to the the motoring architecture
stuff that danny was talking about were

81
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,250
able to

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,040
and change the display clock the chorus
play clock at one time

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,860
if we need to bob up to an even higher
resolution member down with his

84
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,880
dramatically increase on somebody's cues
like on the

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,219
a convertible tablets and notebooks you
know you get like regular PC style

86
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,940
memory bandwidth which is really great
we went up to new USB

87
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,100
as well so that's that's also important
I'm

88
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,430
sort of the way for ever for your what a
gigabyte USB stuff

89
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,550
overall um this is what the

90
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,600
kinda basic block diagram looks like and
and this is

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,770
missus and a bit different than what you
would see on a on a

92
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,960
a client platform does not like a QB I
bus it's a custom

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,479
bring fabric that we use on the item
side just you know within the SRC

94
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm one other big difference is that we
have relative to the client parts

95
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,530
at least since Sandy Bridge we've had
I'm

96
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,729
the GP was able to share and Kashmir way
the last level cache

97
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,920
on the CPU and so they're both the Jeep
you on the CPU are

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,320
are in a great on the same die and they
can share the last level cache

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,310
on here they're gonna same die but we do
not have that cash during sorry to those

100
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,370
a dual-core chunks by PE has their own

101
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,940
share cash but its independent-other but
the graphics

102
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,760
so that makes for I'm quite a different

103
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,020
sir performance characteristics of your
tuning for performance

104
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,190
on on this part versus a and Ivy Bridge
laptop computer gonna see

105
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,320
a very different things because about
lack of cash Aaron

106
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,570
so you have to be careful how you map &
and we back memory and

107
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,820
and also how your how you set up your
rendering and things like that

108
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,020
a and it has a so I it has the Intel HD
graphics plus the

109
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,370
back but Quick Sync stuff that you'd see
on the client side so I can do

110
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,860
live regular video decode events & Co
you'd see at the client's base

111
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,710
and addition to that we've got a VP a
few good engine on these parts

112
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,950
I'm that's available and and

113
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,950
used in some cases

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,260
this one looks really marketing like but
that the cat takeaway for this one is

115
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,510
the

116
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,050
the the huge improvements in empower or
performance you

117
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,410
you get to choose the at the huge
difference here is this

118
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,100
this as the first out in part this outer
border so if you look at our previous

119
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,270
my correct pictures on the CPU side
there been in order maybe do a less you

120
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,090
now we've got up to four cores out a
border and the performances just

121
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,099
dramatically improved if you if you use
when the old adams is like using ARM

122
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,240
platform you know you like

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,380
I don't want to do it builds on this I
don't want it actually log into the

124
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,580
speci- I want to discard his stuff onto
it and

125
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,130
and kind of pretend it's not there this
guy you can log into it and it's like

126
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,469
using Core 2 Duo laptop from a couple
years ago

127
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,260
I mean it's like reasonable speed you
don't wanna stab your eyes out when

128
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,500
using it since

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,160
a huge huge improvement from that from
that point of view and it's got the new

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,389
architecture extension so it's a I'm
it's a reasonable Cebu to deal with in

131
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,410
terms of

132
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,350
having features that you're used to
there's a love for had stuff if you're

133
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,790
interested in a

134
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,849
3d gates

135
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,950
um so this is a some some benchmarks
we've done comparing the

136
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,610
the new Atom CPU side too to some the
competition

137
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,050
I'm like I said the be other guys you
know these are fast arms accused but

138
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,050
they're still terrible

139
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,079
right I mean

140
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,130
sorry if there any arm folks nearby I
just I can't

141
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,430
I used Adam and like even our own
generation Adam was pretty

142
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,479
competitive like it back to be doubts
alarms

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,769
and in using unlike I don't understand
how the young guys even survive like

144
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,850
this is a terrible thing to use a

145
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,470
I don't want to use this platform this
this new one is like

146
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,510
its significantly faster so it's

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,310
you can see I'm in this respect and so
this is like what you know this is or

148
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,500
chrome bench basically

149
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,630
right and its its WAY WAY faster

150
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,709
and the power consumption is also the or
some these guys you know them

151
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,920
the I don't know if this is actually I
so power but you can see the

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,920
at least the clock rate

153
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,079
Greg saying that a great even takes more
power on the same benchmark and gets

154
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,359
less performance I

155
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,309
a there's legal disclaimers beyond that
I don't know what I'm talking about so

156
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,170
yeah I'll just agree with that

157
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,099
the like us for the next big chunk is
the is the graphic side so

158
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,230
getting with imagination I'm you know
legislation is

159
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,170
for their faults their tune into a work
in the mall space and and tell me fairly

160
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,050
power efficient and can achieve high
performance and if you look at the new

161
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,399
latest iPad airs we've done pretty
amazing things with an architecture its

162
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,470
and it's a it's proven I I don't like to
work on it because it's a it's a close

163
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,749
source driver stack as a different
architectural and

164
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:22,439
them what we have and I'm Maurice hours
so I'm really happy about this change

165
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,889
because we have a fully open source tak
I'm

166
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,759
but that's mostly a personal preference
from from a from an Intel perspective I

167
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,360
think we have a

168
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,920
we have an opportunity here to really
prove this architecture out on a

169
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,290
in the lower power emblem I think we're
doing that been

170
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,379
and patron also like you can see that's
only got

171
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:45,709
for use like it's a pretty simple
chopped down from the

172
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,768
from the the client-side Ivy Bridge I'm

173
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,939
so the the performances go scaled-down
on what you

174
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,569
to what you'd expect minus tell us the
Syrian military talk about

175
00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:00,329
um and all I can say is and so is the
futures just

176
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,709
keep your eye on the space it's gonna
get pretty interesting

177
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,138
this year and next year and I i talked
about the

178
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:13,879
the power and the video decode stuff all
available to

179
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,850
um here you can see the the gaming sites
this is basically comparing the graphics

180
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,129
performance

181
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,180
um whereas in a leadership art

182
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,469
by any means for from a graphics
perspective its its

183
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,329
merely competitive I'm to me this is
actually pretty impressive given that

184
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:34,378
it is a a fairly straightforward chopped
down versus like a

185
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,490
be no dedicated redesign for mobile

186
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm the fact we did this well

187
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,439
a with without a tremendous amount of
effort

188
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:47,449
I'm tells me that we have quite a bit of

189
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:51,279
a room to improve and such what parts
you

190
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,009
should be really nice plus we've got an
open-source tax that's pretty exciting

191
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:05,009
and it beats the crap on a roll stuff

192
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,550
a thirty media folks in here there

193
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,040
there so many acronyms and different
codecs

194
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,469
but it does have like the white house
that has the

195
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,030
the same encode and decode supporting
entrance good sport that you'd see in a

196
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,010
quiet part so

197
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,510
I'm that's nice promote Mike
teleconferencing or

198
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,790
I'm you know video calling that sort of
thing

199
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,930
point of view so it's all that stuff is
there and that thats

200
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,500
actually really nice feature of our over
parts and I probably ought to know more

201
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,690
about it but I don't spend much time in
the media side

202
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,720
on the display side

203
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,430
um at 10 by seven you can't really see
this this is the chamber four hours

204
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,020
there are

205
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,530
demons hanging people and torturing them
the

206
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,589
on the display side the the the pipe
stuff in the register block

207
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,590
on the display mostly matches what you'd
see on a client on the client side

208
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,540
but when you got to the port side they

209
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,130
redesigned everything into the custom a
custom implantation above the

210
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,480
but the display fire itself that's the
chamber for sale that's been a

211
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,640
a thorn in our side but I think the
hardware guys really take pleasure in

212
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,090
torturing us um it's just a totally have
a program model we have a very low level

213
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,800
access to all of the five
characteristics and

214
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,849
a all the filtering and things are good
got applied

215
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,230
on on the on the DAC for the for the
fire

216
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,350
so it that's been a challenge to get get
right across a variety of configurations

217
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,570
I'm but on the plus side we've got

218
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,900
may be here we've got I for

219
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,199
for by lanes DisplayPort and we can

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,090
actually go up past 25 by 16 which was
mentioned earlier

221
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:56,520
come I think we're at like 38 by 18 or
something like that so it's a

222
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,800
it's not a it's not a bad display part
either and its relatively low power we

223
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,449
have some

224
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,070
I'm our dating features that we can do
like reading when we ship when the pipes

225
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,830
go off we can actually powered a pole
display engine

226
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,460
a like we do on the graphic side but on
the underside

227
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,740
a.m. when the duties I to weaken public
that so we have that support on the

228
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,860
display side not too much as we missed
some

229
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,310
but the the low-level aspect of it is a

230
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,459
is a pain but were mostly we must live
within our control no

231
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,260
so this is what we're shooting for this
is

232
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,760
this is a a like a display on Idol case

233
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,430
you know we're just looking at your
screen but you're not doing anything I'm

234
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,500
I'm able to render a little bit you can
see the Graphics is what up

235
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,700
but what we're shooting for on Linux

236
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,020
is this when the display goes off

237
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,900
we want the whole src to basically go
off power everything else uses some

238
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,860
like tiny microcontrollers and things
still awake but this is not a force

239
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,540
three-state

240
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,069
this is a a runtime suspend state so let
the SRC

241
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,070
architecture we have now let us get to
really low power consumption

242
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,640
during winter Greg s

243
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,030
are we gonna do are gonna bother with s3
because going to run time: suspend

244
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,660
but yeah I'll s3 in some cases can still
save me a little bit more

245
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,380
then a full runtime: suspend case so
will support both

246
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,060
both s3 and intend to spend over the
place

247
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,569
going forward if we can get parity
between us three in on time to spend I

248
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:28,990
think

249
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,450
at some point we may just implement s3
in terms of runtime to spend

250
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,290
but I'm there is a there's a logic and
there's an overhead to all the meantime

251
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,099
stuff so

252
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,670
s3 is also simpler from a platform
implantation love you so

253
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,630
was trade-offs

254
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,939
so upstream status this we started
pushing these bits way back

255
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,600
almost two years ago now a

256
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,070
landed the initial graphic stuff in 36
I'm

257
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,850
and the and the fold a ser lacks

258
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,530
that's our I runtime: suspend supporters
and pushed upstream just yet in the

259
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,050
course

260
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,910
in the course of things and then a
graphics thats that's pretty much done

261
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,760
we just have to get it

262
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,010
get merged I'm things will stabilize
around 3:10 so if you're starting to get

263
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,520
these platforms for yourself

264
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm don't do anything for 310 or you're
gonna be in that same reporters that I

265
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,530
talked about

266
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,540
I'm the display up and down clock I
talked about so

267
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,719
at I don't think any of those super high
res display

268
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,170
products are out on the market yet but
when they are will be

269
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,099
ready for them so you'll be able to to
use those right away rc6 is

270
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,740
is a feature on this too I'm and it
works I know

271
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,800
so you may have had problems with the
rc6

272
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,250
on Bay Trail is a different connotation
that it is on the clients I'm

273
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,800
and its actually simpler and it seems to
be pretty stable

274
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,750
I'm got

275
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,370
some some display power shutdown stuff
like a talked about some other display

276
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,700
features that are actually not met real
specific bar

277
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,700
dynamic refresh rate support so like if
the screen is mostly

278
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,980
I know you can actually drop the refresh
rate save some power on your Iran

279
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,910
rebound with what your

280
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,480
members then so free fresh for longer a

281
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,220
we have some bugs um again chamber of
horrors

282
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,579
the this one we just fixed a the day
before I

283
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,770
caught my flight out here and that about
and

284
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,430
been driving me nuts for we can have so
I'm really

285
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,040
set happy that we we fix that so I'm

286
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,750
if you're buying a a better base
platform on Amazon or something now

287
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,810
you you would have run into that like
right away but

288
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,080
we've got it under control Sebastian fix
the current girls on wall

289
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,080
personal attacks stable I'm and then
there's some other issues like Alan

290
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,629
Alan Cox got this to 100 machine with a
bit rail Tia tablet

291
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,430
ask you in it and it had I'm

292
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,120
it's actually maybe base panel

293
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,800
on that on his machine but it showed up
as a VGA

294
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,020
some for some reason and and he was

295
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,280
as he was trying to configure it you
know he's like I can go to work by

296
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,810
if I program the VGA to do this and it
just so happened to use program the BJ

297
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,760
in such a way that

298
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,350
we were driving both BJ and and maybe
with the same timings and that this

299
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,520
would happen work so

300
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,060
there's still some things we have to
work out on the piece I we haven't

301
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,300
tested it tremendously

302
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,820
I'm just an upstream the next we have a
caller and retries but

303
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,800
some so was his improvements there on
the Mesa side it's been

304
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,100
it's been in for a long time since
mister 92

305
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,209
and even before I think a there's

306
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,370
a lot of performance I'm head room here
like the

307
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,989
performance first for some things is
actually looking pretty good

308
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,500
but for other things were like a half
the speed that we could be so the Mesa

309
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,320
teams just kinda

310
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,560
continue improving performance there I'm
ian is probably not here since

311
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,350
we're out last night until about 6:30
a.m. I'm

312
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,530
but you can ask him later when he shows
up

313
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,629
on the media side

314
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,790
it's been supported it in Libya a

315
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,110
as a 121 release the vp8 stuff is in
progress

316
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,310
um the way that the vp8 better
integrated they

317
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,149
it share some logic in terms of power
gating and then rub support

318
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,660
with I 15 IP blocks 0 there are some
money for 10 changes required and then

319
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,050
there's a

320
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,690
a buncha a driver and retrieve thats
that published an open source but it's

321
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,310
not a great upstream and I don't know

322
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,870
if the the people we have working on are
actually pushing upstream

323
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,899
or not might blame in staging at some
point but I'm

324
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,550
its it's pretty ugly still so I'm

325
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:50,520
working on that there are a few
platforms out there now

326
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,710
a mostly windows stuff um I

327
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,430
I keep refreshing on Amazon until up
because I wanna see that the Android

328
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,220
tablets come out

329
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,420
but I think those are becoming the next
couple months I'm

330
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,540
or if you go to Shenzhen China you can
have them will be one right now

331
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,620
on thats that's been another kind of
issue

332
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,530
people building where configurations and
saying it doesn't work I'm

333
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,820
and if you'd so be looking for this news
items include them here

334
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,399
you can also jump on Wikipedia was all
there but if you're on Newegg or

335
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,410
something you want to look

336
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,880
there's a a new a knock the next unit of
computing

337
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,410
I'm intel's let's have a side project
for Intel

338
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,590
nice little tiny form factor device

339
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,720
but has there's one with nature on it
now there's

340
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,140
as a new love has well a new betrayal
and Sabah those are really nice

341
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,210
platforms for

342
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,760
for tired a nice like that better one
hopefully it's painless

343
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,879
a.m. so that's a fun way to get your

344
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,800
bitter feud with but with petrol fuel
and then there's there's new stuff

345
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,860
coming soon as keep your

346
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,840
keep looking

347
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,459
okay legal disclaimer anything I said
you can began speaking

348
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,070
I'm fool to

349
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:12,070
so any questions

350
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,840
Andrew

351
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,738
I can hear and PSO you're going to be

352
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,779
on the Mesa side I love the graphics use
police poor

353
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,639
Open GL yes 3.0 in when you bring this
over to enjoy

354
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:38,289
there obviously gonna be supporting it
there as well will you be bringing

355
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,539
desktop Open GL to the Android side

356
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,720
while being able to read it with Andy GL
context

357
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,659
will we be bringing full Open GL

358
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:55,299
to Android um but let's not something
that we're gonna stop people from doing

359
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,989
I don't think Google has any plans to to
expose the full geo API through their

360
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:00,639
framework

361
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:04,699
I'm which is really will be required but
if you wanna take

362
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,019
a you know builds an engine with Mesa
and an A

363
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:11,289
and enable 4gl in your build and then do

364
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,759
and UK stuff that's definitely doable
think I'm

365
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,269
that on enjoy their slight some
additional complexity to the grotto GL

366
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,299
wrapper library

367
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:22,440
to Turkana unify the the feature set

368
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,879
I'm buddy at something that something he
could if I do a few

369
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:32,609
wanted to I'm experienced so here but
you'd be good when asked about you

370
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:39,609
and the other questions

371
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,020
no cool I'm glad I got to brag about
this I've been excited about this

372
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,710
performance from the upper

373
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,990
thanks %ah

374
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,430
so next up is going to be about

375
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,480
Nouveau a its gonna
