what

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,429
artistic latter okay so my role HP is a
bit unique in the fact that I lied

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,180
are open source program office I which
entails like compliance

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,310
and our external outreach in and
community engagement

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,850
as well as are leading legal support
Open Source Matters

26
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,780
also leave legal support for cloud on
but in terms of open source my role is

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,509
it unique

28
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,409
I'm within the company and before I i've
been leading open source now at HP for a

29
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,930
couple of years and I think these people
three years

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,040
I about six months after coming to HP I

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,159
I had an opportunity to transfer into
the business and do a business wall

32
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,490
for six months and that will prison
itself

33
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,318
in the cloud organization and it was at
that point in time when

34
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,440
HP was deciding to go with on OpenStack
as its cloud offerings I had the

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,459
opportunity to

36
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:19,910
participate in the decision-making
process and then transfer over to the

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,549
business

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,560
to do a six-month rotation to the
business really helped drive

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,480
the community engagement and drive our
participation OpenStack

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,369
it for me it was at a great learning
experience because

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,690
prior to that might my role at sign was
in the legal department I had

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,940
really looked at open source before that
primarily from a legal lands

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,870
on and I've been assigned for nearly 12
years and at you know a great experience

44
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,890
they're working with

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,379
all kinds of open source projects from
Java to open office to you

46
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,569
I OpenSolaris a across the game but

47
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,679
MySQL it was a great experience but I
always try to look at things from a

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
legal ads

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,870
so for me transfer into the business I
think gave me a new perspective

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,140
on and get deathly broaden my horizons
for the way they look at the source in a

51
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,980
way to engage with communities

52
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,359
tiffany is great learning experience and
it helps you prepare me I think for the

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,879
wall

54
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,840
when I have the option to take over and
leave the open source program office

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,150
so that the topic today I'm going to
discuss really is around

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,330
have licensing models in building
community so it's kind of tying those

57
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,760
two

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,940
areas of my experience together and get
it right it

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,459
keep that the presentation part really
sure can actually do you want to solicit

60
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,069
in plate from you guys a heads up

61
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,488
so for a gender perspective on it a talk
real sort of what I think it is very

62
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,530
susceptible what you need to build

63
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,599
a buyer and successful open source
community and then talk about you know

64
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
the open source license and what will
that place

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,260
and only a community and then I wanna
kinda

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,149
look at the Lanza the landscape I know
this is something that probably spoke

67
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,769
about earlier

68
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,000
Lisa looking at the permissive license
and how

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,299
we're starting to it see more projects
as permissible license projects and see

70
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,580
what impact that has and how that
shipping out

71
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,700
and then also I want it solicit input
about the

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,920
what your thoughts are in terms of it so
why that's happening as well as the

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,518
potential

74
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,390
impact about longer-term so

75
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,579
it a very simplistic level I believe
there's three

76
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,880
critical components to build a
successful vibrant open source community

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,219
are first and foremost I think he a
great technology

78
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,729
I also believe you need sound governance
structure

79
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,349
as in the least was the question the
piano the government's key so that

80
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,970
and 38 I believe that the license also
plays a role in that

81
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,050
any license that is perceived fair and
received favorable within the community

82
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,740
as well

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,370
but I mean I recognize that these three
are not created equal

84
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,530
i mean clearly technology is the one
that that is key in the most critical

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,448
component here

86
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:54,210
because without a great technology the
governance model and licensing model are

87
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,109
socially relevant

88
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,400
but that being said I do think that the
open source license plate or bowl

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,799
in helping to build a community it plays
a role in adoption

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,580
I think it has interesting well within
that whole ecosystem that i dont wanna

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,258
talk about

92
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,889
I'm and so for the purposes up this
discussion and I'm gonna tee it up

93
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:16,990
and I realize a game to you grossly
oversimplify licensing

94
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,150
models how and get up but grossly
oversimplify them to

95
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,630
all open source licenses are either
copyleft a permissive

96
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,070
and by couple of tiny you have a
contractual obligation to contribute

97
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,110
let's get it back to the community and
impressive

98
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,490
he don't have that contractual
obligation site I really was a gross

99
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,810
oversimplification but just bear with me
as we

100
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,570
as we talk to this guy doing get some
some good feedback out of this

101
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,889
so that being said can a permissive TDY

102
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,539
met premises licence be used to build an
open source community

103
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,130
the interesting thing is I was I was
grappling with this question about ten

104
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,740
years ago

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,400
when I was with at Sun Microsystems and
I had the opportunity to help lead

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,429
our efforts in open source it's less as
solar sways

107
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,350
sounds operating system it was it the
really key and critical piece

108
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,009
a technology for sin and at the time he
was grappling with this

109
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,300
anyone if it the business things that we
wanted to accomplish there as we wanted

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,110
to build an open

111
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,740
source community around it that was
really the objective it was forcing it

112
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,620
was to build this community

113
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,819
so that me real recognize that the
licensing

114
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,380
model would play a role in that and at
the time I was really is struggling with

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,509
this question and I

116
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,750
a spell for the number of open source
luminaries I spoke with other lawyers I

117
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,850
looked at what's happening in the
community

118
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,229
and I came to conclusion at that point
in time ten years ago

119
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,349
that you could not use oppressive
license to build a community

120
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,680
and maybe you know yeah I recognize I
have been practicing law

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,750
and that one at that point made clear so
he looked at thanks

122
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,910
more the black-and-white perspective but
that's why I believed at that point I

123
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,300
likely that you really

124
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,819
or to build that strong vibrant
community he needed copyleft

125
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,710
it so I came to it from that vantage
point to lose but I've been struggling

126
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,500
with

127
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,660
this question recently and thinking is
the same

128
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,380
if I look at this question today do I
believe the same thing do I believe

129
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,639
today

130
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,340
that message life is can be used to
build and the vibrant open source

131
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,719
community

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,770
I think order to answer that question i
sorry thinking about him or what how can

133
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,340
I help

134
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,039
you know navigate this the answer this
question and so I start

135
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,068
a speaking up okay thank you speak
louder

136
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,270
said in order to help answer that
question i want to look at

137
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,729
sorta what was happening in the
licensing model ecosystem in general

138
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,960
and then also what was happening in
terms of vendor engagement with those

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,120
open source projects and then thirdly
what was happening in terms of

140
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,669
contributions

141
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,448
to open source projects so still looking
at all those in order to help me

142
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,080
understanding better answer this
question

143
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,930
two interns I love what's happening
within the licensing

144
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,560
landscape ecosystem in general when I
saw as I start looking at

145
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,860
very survey sources I looked at flocked
of law small

146
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,680
and Google have and what I saw was
pretty interesting

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,860
even though those three survey sources
all used

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,139
you know different this statistical
samples what have you they were all to

149
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:10,770
me

150
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,190
either showing in demonstrating or
supporting the same general trend today

151
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,710
I thought was happening with an
ecosystem which was there is an increase

152
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,419
implicitly license projects

153
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,659
so again that when I was starting to to
so here's to enter total stern's see

154
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,160
was sort of hand it was supported by the
evidence

155
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,060
as far as the these survey sources as
well

156
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,189
you recognize that this is not to say
the GPL

157
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,700
is going away anytime soon could still
you know turns absolute numbers is by

158
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,969
far the clear

159
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,209
winner however I did find it an
interesting trend

160
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,439
and so I thought we did a little bit
deeper and find out you know what else I

161
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,420
can glean from this

162
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,279
in orch try to help answer these kinds
of questions

163
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,640
so intrude so far this was and Aaron
Williamson

164
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
show this a recent minutes I'm event and
I think films interesting because you

165
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,570
know get

166
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,240
on the get help found but what are these
these partisan again it's its whatev

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,279
demonstrating

168
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,000
that we're having more and more
permissive licenses out there and that's

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,700
that they're sorta this increasing

170
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,940
has been his account okay on

171
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,290
it cuz you to purchase real for the end
okay X

172
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,529
and the next thing yesterday looking at
was then your engagement

173
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,600
I from with these open source projects
because it again this this statistical

174
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,209
samples are great but I i

175
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,010
was looking at 451 group in trying to
just again grass a better understanding

176
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,410
what's happening in this in this thing
this ecosystem

177
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,990
and what I saw was you know there's this
gradual shift

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,850
in a strong populist in terms of vendor
engage with these projects

179
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,100
graduation shipped out children 2006

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,080
just a tick 6 2007 researchers here
pretty sharp decline

181
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,269
in the hard copy of licenses germs a
vendor engagement

182
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:56,610
and around the same time period this
2006-2007 time period

183
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,110
we start to see a more significant
increase in terms of permissive my sis

184
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,410
integers the vendor engagement with
these projects

185
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,880
as was was the guy it's hard to beat
yeah

186
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,209
over here number vendors and it goes to
the years

187
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,010
site a small apologists more about tax
expressed K

188
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,279
ones yes in terms of up yes preferences
in terms of participating

189
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,060
projects yes exactly the way the vendors
prefer to engage with what kinda

190
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,199
projects yeah

191
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,769
thank you small small font something
back and watch this

192
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,920
a and then that the thirty a look at his
contributions

193
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,370
contributions in terms of on how r

194
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,769
developers can create the and companies
contributing to these projects

195
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,209
and for the contribution peace a look at
a very small sample I was looking at

196
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:42,979
trying to get

197
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Creek look at somebody similarly
situated projects that are new open

198
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,190
source projects

199
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,300
am so but I looked at in this case was

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,390
03 clout projects for such a club
projects all open source

201
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,980
elected OpenStack CloudStack in
Eucalyptus

202
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,329
to open second CloudStack both christie
Lee licensed

203
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,920
eucalyptus copyleft Academy on foot
notice

204
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,589
is call stack actually changes licensing
model in 2012

205
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,470
from a copyleft model to a permissive
model

206
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,950
and so as I was kidding around I also
found some interesting statistics around

207
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,339
now

208
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,510
which were bet the number of
contributions in the number contributors

209
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,740
particularly the number contributors it
was pretty significant increase

210
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,060
in that year half period after they made
the licensing model change

211
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,109
which kinda was contrary to what I as
expected

212
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm so it's interesting I from that time
period

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,459
it went from fifty approximately 50
contributors to 250

214
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,619
so significant increase their I'm

215
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,700
and then with respect to you click s its
kinda what I would expected

216
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,260
ten years ago it's been expected now
which is basically that

217
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,189
have when you have a copy of project you
do have to contributors and you do have

218
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,870
that sense appear your building at

219
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,920
that cooperation you have any
contributions back into the witness by

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,420
the number

221
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,319
Mets Federer with Apache and the Apache
2.0 for OpenStack

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,410
this is the only found it really
interesting because I

223
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,800
and you're involved with OpenStack I'm I

224
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,849
was when it got involved with a sack
pretty early on with an HP

225
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,480
and I have the opportunity to help set
up if the sack donation then

226
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,620
and I participate as a director on the
OpenStack foundation for as well

227
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,519
so that's why I'm pretty firmly within
technologies I but for me it was

228
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,899
interesting to look at this

229
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,940
from the contributor perspective in the
sense that

230
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,720
it was quite frankly just some somewhat
amazed by the number of contributors

231
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,790
the number of commits and was code
contributed here

232
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,449
so guess not really expected instead
because if a look at this

233
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,649
from where a first look at the Lanza had
10 years ago

234
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,420
I would have expected I that the number
should be much lower

235
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,610
think that's one of the things that feel
when I was the quite frankly

236
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,329
and at sign and we were open source its
lawyers as well my concerns

237
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,250
I was concerned that if we you know put
the

238
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,820
cold out there under a premises licence
that we wouldn't build a community we

239
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,760
wouldn't get the contributions back

240
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,410
but I think this sorted by hand shows
that if he can indeed happen

241
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,560
and i think im gonna make it yearly
again this is really a very simple

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,199
cation

243
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,329
certified conclusion here but I I I want
to open up for dialogue and negative

244
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,510
feedback on S

245
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,180
and from but so again looking at the
question I asked years ago

246
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,180
today I think I would answer the
question differently and its

247
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,410
its you off a second one single example
recognizers

248
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,969
there's you know many many open source
projects out there but for me i'm

249
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,760
looking at it through the slides in
trying to

250
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,620
to make sense of it all and I think
again going back to the original wanna

251
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,350
office components that are needed

252
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,940
you obviously need a great technology
hand which OpenStack is is a great

253
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,790
technology

254
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,050
he also need sound governance structure
which i think that the project they took

255
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,519
that very seriously

256
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,810
and created a very sound governance
structure I think it was a sound

257
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,649
governance structure and a forced
turnover to a foundation to to be honest

258
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,620
I think

259
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,790
Rackspace did a number of things right
in creating project Policy Board in

260
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,500
Japan

261
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,220
you know in creating a tech meritocracy
0 around the project

262
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,829
but nonetheless I think under the
foundation it is a sound governance

263
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:06,888
structure with

264
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,790
in a profound Asian you also have a
technical committee that really does run

265
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,579
the technical

266
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,269
it be to the project and in the
licensing model I think

267
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,829
help drive that adoption and but
nonetheless I think

268
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:24,099
I think present licensee license can be
used to build those kinds of projects

269
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,920
I in to try that said to and this is my
last night but I do wanna

270
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,209
and go back to a prior slide when I open
it up for questions

271
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,899
any good question first and say for sure
project

272
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,889
I was just asking about the and slightly
the can we go back to that

273
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:45,410
yeah I'm about somehow we he was
counting Fox was a candle or the Fox

274
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,060
particular project as well always yeah
it was it was I think it was

275
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,189
doing the top level he but the other
thing that I remember so from that

276
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,050
survey as well as it happens

277
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,260
I don't put a lot of the projects and
get major cities

278
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,939
Nisha leaving work license at all so
they didn't try to compile

279
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,860
with the PLO percent right because they
took but a survey sample

280
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,990
as those and then they try to do is get
the highest level life

281
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,510
but it doesn't account for about 10 tell
me there's there's probably that he said

282
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,360
and the what you were talking about
compatibility and what's with the life

283
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,570
we think is a bit

284
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,579
there's I think there's multiples a
dozen which i think you're comin ball

285
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:25,800
I think that was taken from arlen smith
was a life jacket that was the day today

286
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,779
eating using masala G yes someone ask
you the same question

287
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,570
yeah about whether discounts for forbes
and I don't call you

288
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,779
rental he said he said

289
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,630
absent okay those answer okay so

290
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,810
people great I was a love like a

291
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,630
again for me it's I think its new in it
if it gets interesting the

292
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,639
these the shift well you have any
comments you might hear

293
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,940
properly I mean I love you process i
think i think that

294
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,019
here's what sounds to me almost like you
made

295
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,600
defensive yesterday here this licenses
which i think is

296
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,610
sacher I think that anybody says camps
his

297
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,720
error so so I believe he couldn't ten
years ago

298
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,019
yeah i i think I every movie

299
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,839
I think of bills better communities it's
their constitution eyes and see if you

300
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:15,750
answered about governance

301
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,370
I see it that reserve license like the
Articles of Confederation

302
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,550
and cited the US but this like our
Federation

303
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,620
which was a a very loose think that was
abandoned by

304
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,990
the United States early days and US
Constitution much like GPL

305
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,130
stronger by forced I

306
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,009
as their confessions to lose that's the
point is that disallows allow the states

307
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,630
to do whatever they want it sometimes

308
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,220
that thanks for the whole country task

309
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,910
but said the check button is pressed
charges or covers with you

310
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,050
it's a to develop yes you get by

311
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,540
yeah he eats it people who take our

312
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,550
a project animator products mom

313
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,029
are buyers great awesome website

314
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,740
up all fire to you tryna string

315
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,120
way make right after that practice even

316
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,379
that tries in not just people in it

317
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,000
nearly don't believe as and cells

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,490
you the drive that much ash actually
having

319
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,169
restate way to let my question to cause
that's what I was thinking just reading

320
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,309
a lot into saudi

321
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,910
is the technical debt this but let me
just say that

322
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,950
arm you normal kinda every day when when

323
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,360
things are not going is going well not
way

324
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,789
%uh functionally PSEG heels

325
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:44,330
so the only the only difference ashes
happens when things

326
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,439
to hell and mmm is a big difference

327
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,020
me and I'll people wanted can actually
take the

328
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,049
hittin cells in

329
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,450
one planes and expects but that does
make sense in

330
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,970
and saint let me ask a question do you
think a bP said this that is because

331
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,539
about technical that because it was just
makes it easier

332
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:08,710
to contribute back in %uh yeses yes

333
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,289
from the developer's perspective that's
is slows five ish

334
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,350
yeah it feels good but my observation

335
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,539
are the companies that how

336
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,990
you always you look like other no
doolittle

337
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,650
only you play years

338
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,860
page some the force you to stream that
and

339
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,649
that ace are so

340
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,200
is I don't think in life I I think ever
seen

341
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,890
its community K cash that was published
by someone

342
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,270
Austria cells new toys and even with us
cells

343
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,200
tree okay mom because %uh that that you
can visit

344
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,380
also because that person to you way

345
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,320
yes yes yes okay thank you

346
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,720
yeah I passed my myself and

347
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,870
if that you could do this comparison
mean

348
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,659
if if there is the offender reso

349
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,190
money and who's who's going to be

350
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,820
to support people close friend in trying
to benefit from it

351
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,340
that's 50l of course

352
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,500
arm putting a lot of money in putting up

353
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,770
very cute approaching structure and and

354
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,290
this is also very attractive for
whatever of us

355
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,678
and think the most La Paz on on really
thinking of

356
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,990
be expects licensed known

357
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,760
they they are thinking more about the
technology and

358
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,690
okay everyone assess a bit different
motivation and I think when

359
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,809
when when the when figure of but that's
a project with

360
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,760
missive licenses rising human

361
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,929
its more arm related arm

362
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,760
to let's say the the the money which are
which

363
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,360
are around men's are putting in
exhausting 2.2

364
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,409
okay thank you it

365
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,789
gone

366
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,600
on haitian

367
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,570
on

368
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,620

house okay great thank you

378
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,120
I'll I notice

379
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,870
said license

380
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,250
why yeah that's it thank curious about
that as well

381

very both sorry

382

without

384
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,670
well

385
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,180
oh that's interesting okay okay

386
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,360
is lol that's what I'm well-thought it
me that the common understanding do you

387
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,810
think in the developer community that's

388
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,129
thats the thing that I find interesting
yes or yeah

389
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,360
this lies ok and

390
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,070
partner do bus

391
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:01,070
lawyers for away

392
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,920
yeah side

393
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,720
just permissive also is a tradition one
raid

394
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,270
North people's okay

395
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,100
that thank you that's very interesting
thank you a

396
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,199
okay canisters believed that I

397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
to spend over and scarce intend

398
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,790
standing

399
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,560
licensing and I wasn't does this

400
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,790
me growth very life cycle project maybe

401
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,029
like you know compared people dead
particular year

402
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,759
yeah yeah the latest see how it played
out

403
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,909
yeah I think that's a really good point
here and that's something I thought

404
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,119
about as well idk how

405
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,238
because I recognize like right now using
OpenStack as as an

406
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:54,119
single example right now it's not a very
popular project it's doing quite well

407
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,759
it the community it was getting along
right what happened at that

408
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,129
it somehow it somewhat the future that's
no longer the case

409
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,738
it's like then I start to think okay how
with

410
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:09,320
know how it plays out because it's under
Apache versus if they had licensed it

411
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,668
under different licensing model

412
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,149
how would that play out long-term and
that's something that I'm

413
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:17,998
that I am a you know very interested to
see how this all plays out but

414
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:21,009
but I get it I kinda look after the
perspective miles

415
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,139
you know hindsight is 20/20 I wonder
what we're gonna see

416
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,959
you know five ten years down the road
but it's a really great point cuz I

417
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,929
thought about that

418
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:32,440
quite a bit whether you can make a
comment about like yeah and also because

419
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,899
right time but that's another was weird
crazy so

420
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,139
so that now it doesn't work I over there
wasa

421
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:43,580
concrete examples explain why I think
when you're talking about or

422
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,799
I would like to help students are the
core application well I think there's

423
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,840
not much difference because the point
you're making over there about the

424
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,359
someone to replace yes roasts offers as
these days have some

425
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,678
way of putting add-ins a of some sort
that are harder for

426
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,960
like an architect or something like that
and that's where copyleft really has

427
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,700
value because that's all the different
communities so you have the core

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,919
community which OpenStack

429
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,359
has hard evidence that yes and so forth
but I know it's like you can do out on

430
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,259
models and so

431
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:13,159
right and that will I would expect this
is pure speculation

432
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,679
that community will slowly be a slightly
different and that nearly one mostly a

433
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,149
proprietary adults

434
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:22,729
whereas OpenStack for GP else those add
ons will have to also

435
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,759
so so while you're in a community the
core committee may Bay

436
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,950
think the home along just no
indefinitely the blogging community may

437
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,119
become a proprietary

438
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,158
I'll what's interesting point are you
can send their

439
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:42,159
license best bookkeepers and select news
right anything but I always talk about

440
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:42,999
the sign you know

441
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:49,999
/url writer for what the hell was I have
I don't know but I seen it fail another

442
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,738
from is the last price but I don't know
specifically a number of fields

443
00:24:54,739 --> 00:25:01,739
say what do you think I if you have not
been set

444
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,639
you can be both the ones that you can be
developed as you have a good

445
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,879
separation make your eyes you can be of
reading riser plugins

446
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,110
and park the car nearly simultaneous yes
week but ice

447
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,129
everybody many companies are doing
styles

448
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,549
yeah I'll as early as as 2 I'm skeptical

449
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,330
what roads

450
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,549
to well its oppose actually before my
time

451
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,809
but I but I can say this to you %uh
another time

452
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,639
one just two minutes okay okay okay okay

453
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,508
the the question was what drove
OpenStack to choose a plus a licensing

454
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:45,960
model

455
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,470
um and it was before my time before I
got involved in the project because they

456
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,710
actually open source that in July 2010

457
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,549
it was a joint project between ross I'm
actually and nasa

458
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:58,730
federal government and they actually
chill the reason they chose Apache is

459
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,210
because they want to drive adoption

460
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,460
and they believed by choosing a promise
a license model

461
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,909
it it would enhance and drive adoption
time and increase that that was the

462
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,100
primary reason at least that's what I've
been told

463
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,559
that business daily so so there was
another reason on

464
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,830
there's a lot of criticism look just at
the time oh yeah I remember from getting

465
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,470
that stalker

466
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,840
Hill star some I last year but you can
flip the switch out on that slide it

467
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,570
looked as had

468
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,110
GB of free in a very model go buy one

469
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,559
company mom the predecessor CloudStack

470
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,759
was very similar used to be a weekly
officially and I think OpenStack wanted

471
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,190
to distinguish itself from

472
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,669
these companies that have business
models are being heavily criticized at

473
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:39,190
the time

474
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,179
okay work also drink orders so I think
that was part of it as well

475
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:48,529
that's an excellent by Richard right yes
partially reaction post

476
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,659
parents know it was a political

477
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,039
okay I was aggressive because these

478
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,700
these on uses a GPL v3 by mutually to
that point

479
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,750
that 451 group made about one single
vendors

480
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,610
not mobile vendors engaging others
recent ones

481
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,799
the eucalyptus was not a Multiple in
multiple vendor

482
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,090
project manager was klaus pasta
klout.com

483
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,158
these are very much control by one
company I mean Rackspace had that role

484
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,929
to some degree

485
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,629
and notice tacked it was following or as
a multi-vendor

486
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:25,490
problem and I think that was the gold
less and less likely to the last word

487
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:32,490
clock so to a summer yet good on
