1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,810
with I yes

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,559
no

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,610
the but didn't

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,369
last year against him a more activist
turned up for grabs this year is

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,950
divisible

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,740
be a club when you to give us an update
about to are running next comprise a

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,220
reserve nvm that again soon

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,830
the all rights Diallo a rotten so

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,280
I where the let's cut on dragon wings

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,399
so do the

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,620
a what's hot topic here so who has heard
about

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,629
lol p.m. race and whole perfect what's
hard about

13
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:54,160
all who have used collapse which is the
compiler front

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,209
yeah okay so Obama

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,960
our project is about compiling the
Cocteau Twins

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,969
klaas so okay

17
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:08,510
from the shop call you all know a ladder
VM

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,080
stopping ass low-level virtual machine

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,460
and I we want to use

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,408
the compiler but also we want to use
things like the

21
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,759
code analysis yeah Checa I

22
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,119
and tree want to be able in the end s

23
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,350
goal to use code refactoring

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,509
so why

25
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,880
well combining to cuddle takes quite
some time if we can speed that up

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,270
a even better I well

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,740
still that's about compiling yeah for
the linker we still rely on

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,229
on the Guld yeah so

29
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,579
Obama there are still two sides of the
story compile types of hardstyle

30
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,630
we have a lot of potential

31
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,630
in clanging and there is still a lot of
work and a lot of things which can be

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,160
due

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,870
which can be done I in terms of
optimizations

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,640
arm for example I

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,890
11 student it

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,359
last year was trying to get

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,580
the I'm elevate ela via my arm

38
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,120
the intermediate representation of the
cuddle

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,150
and then he wanted group to do some
research or apply optimizations or

40
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,710
whatever

41
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,400
on the intermediate language here so

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,830
I I think that has a lot of potential I

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,410
we also have to decide project where
once she wouldn't

44
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,070
I am made sure that the

45
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,079
checker which is the setting analyzer
it's able to run

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,320
against the Linux kernel now they are
few

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,459
pictures I am upon the check outside

48
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,370
that has been solved and we can now get
um

49
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,540
static analysis runs on the cob arm

50
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,329
it works you can see it on our best
brought it's available

51
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,280
just on the job check a subfolder Tom

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,650
still there's quite some work to do well
they'd kick it was first done with

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,860
kind of users basing my aunt yeah so I

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,000
if you would do a check to run against
the cuddle do you still see quite a few

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,040
false positives of things that don't
apply it

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,350
in terms of the car but it's a really
good

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,780
I to work because it shows Hugh

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,600
the power in where the issue happens

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,060
and you wouldn't believe how deep those
past are sometimes in the condo

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,950
yeah like 30 six steps that's nothing
you can

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,760
find out with just a human review or in
the

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,709
mmm expecting the coat yeah if it if it
descends

63
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:18,228
36 steps also kinda

64
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,159
is saw a little bit misused in a lot of
other projects

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
and %uh for example renderscript

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,700
you associate its use to I its meanwhile

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,930
hard in day in the Android NDK well
there were some DRO more they

68
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,800
trove 122 compiler all of Android with
Cuttack well

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,870
let's see what happens um it's certainly
have I

70
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,710
that when tips that in terms of Android
they can kind of focus on just one

71
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,140
compiler well let's see

72
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,560
I it's part of the year

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,200
a gallery in 3d and and the Empire

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,940
drivers and others and

75
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,110
if you are interested their support
tomorrow in the week lol %um debt from

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,810
from

77
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,260
sylvester I she does a full rebuild of

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,280
deviant with you to use a space

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,739
with and Andrea so

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,920
what about our I let me and the next
project

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,190
so we want to compile the carnal for
multiple architectures

82
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,340
with the LBM plan and IBM torching

83
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,969
I Antti wants to fix issue for a treat
which we find on the way

84
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,720
that started out with kind of class not
supporting whatever nitty-gritty year a

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,810
feature that

86
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,360
was fused and the con all I am and

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,850
on the other side they are few things in
the car which %uh

88
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,650
kind of horrible and JCC doesn't

89
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,140
complain yeah I am no low offense its
just

90
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,690
kind of the cut electricity there are
always kind of developed

91
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,060
I am um driving

92
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,470
each other so I'm

93
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,770
and they were kind of topic pushing the
boundaries so um

94
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,389
now clanging usually is a high end of
more

95
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,120
yeah goes by the book yeah go it's
really easy

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,440
really by the standard so we find a few
issues where

97
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,070
I whether

98
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,180
the court shouldn't actually work yeah
still

99
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,800
I am g52 eats a temp and

100
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,820
from so we had a few things to fix in
ela via

101
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,099
I we are kind of a meter project

102
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,300
yeah we college the capture sui %uh

103
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,130
kind of spit them out and feed them into
the upstream projects

104
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,170
that worker who I worked out really well

105
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,860
right now with and Winfrey point for the
latest stable release you need no

106
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,030
patches to 11 p.m.

107
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,299
still we need a few patches to the
cuddle

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,450
yeah because well compiler flax need to
be

109
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,469
a set or the compiler needs to be reset
so they are a few issues

110
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,919
I in the cuddle I

111
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,599
what else

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,610
so for meme part

113
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,140
all patches which I needed of street cap

114
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,409
I ongoing entry point 5

115
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,620
and day be told how she is doing an avid
ever lived up here

116
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,310
I we also get rid of one nasty piece

117
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,770
which is scored 16 support yet that's

118
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,159
for aborting the x86 CPU

119
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,410
and some that's wassup present in class
meanwhile we havent

120
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,870
so we can get the boot up heart I

121
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,710
soft I to now we still on he wished

122
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,450
for just be sparks GCC yeah but we have
that now

123
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,800
I and some

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,350
one I am fixing

125
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,130
here which if

126
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,300
in the console that ES

127
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,520
com we still have to upstream

128
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,080
a lot of cops arm

129
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,260
they are some %uh small Obama Obama just
in neighboring

130
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,169
other compilers to work with the Connell
I

131
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,689
others they eat deal with a few

132
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,890
I'll larger problems one

133
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,910
is for example what we call release

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,990
I don't mix it up with blau delay is
perfectly fine

135
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,840
so arrival um I think the rate that's
perfectly fine

136
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,870
but we're rivaling to rate in the
structure

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,520
if kind of evil and crime doesn't
support it

138
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,740
effectually even not part of the C stand
out

139
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,590
I still have such pieces of coat

140
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,040
trying I want especially in crypto and
in

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,540
and in the netfilter stack and

142
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,150
regarding crypto the problem if that
code gets now copied over

143
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,240
in every phase of the Connell yeah

144
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,690
like dude to I am the

145
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:33,370
a yes encryption invite high now uses
such peace S a bad week where you end up

146
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,120
having

147
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,870
I variety the rivaling for breaking the
structure

148
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,660
are you kind of next best talk show with
over rivaling for grade

149
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,199
into another structure boom I'm that
happens a lot and that's a big problem

150
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,900
right now

151
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,010
I'm we talk to the client guys and they
said

152
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,450
no it's nothing we it's nothing we want
to support and its

153
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,450
it's a part of the C standard and
achieved evil

154
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,810
arm last year during I'm

155
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,390
the plumbers conference I am

156
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,880
we had line is in the room and

157
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,920
after looking at his a its it's actually
bad so

158
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,079
but it take for quite some time to
figure this out

159
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,750
now and get the to get the patch

160
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,980
upstream now I

161
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,500
some just if you happen to work on some
coat

162
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,800
yeah police make sure you don't use

163
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,349
I I these

164
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,820
in new coat a difference

165
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,839
evening clanging is I week NDS

166
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,089
infection attributes the conduct
yourself that

167
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,480
Inc 'em when we do the module

168
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,630
yeah driver modules we assign the

169
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,210
I module innate once we can make this
connection

170
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,750
where you with a week ABS the problem is

171
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,170
GCC in makes just this site

172
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,569
of the alias inherit all the sections on
this site

173
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,120
yeah so the upper elementary kids all
the

174
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,230
a section and all the annotations from
the

175
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,380
from from the from the mmm

176
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,990
super willing to plan doesn't do that

177
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,330
yeah so that's a difference

178
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,770
I'm right now it's it's no problem we
just applied they had the necessary

179
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,850
attributes at this point over here

180
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,910
right now I

181
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,650
we also do not use the integrated a
sample of clan

182
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,660
it would be possible to compile and link

183
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,449
West clan at once yeah and kind of

184
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,940
el Teo ish apply more optimizations

185
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,950
I for x86

186
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,700
we still have a few thanks to sort out

187
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,900
could 16 was one with that

188
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,680
I kind of salt from

189
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,000
we planned to you navel hot the
integrated the sample again and give it

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,770
a new run

191
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:19,470
forearm we have a few issues with the
assembly style used in the condo

192
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,230
Perseus Port Klang expects so I

193
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,060
if you want to try it out have ice I

194
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,849
a tomorrow is another talk I

195
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,670
in the elderly and Ephraim be you can
try it out

196
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,870
I we have website link follows

197
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,180
and we how I'm

198
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,449
at Victory which hosts a set of make
fights

199
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,140
which allows you to pull everything
build everything

200
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,810
so you get our necks 8664 cuddle

201
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,479
or I what took place to be half be
expressed as:

202
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,480
s a GM would target I we have also a few
reports and if you enjoy it

203
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,520
Cardinals kind of next seven is
supported so you could try that

204
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,060
out on your PC you on a real target

205
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,050
arm its kinda always a moving project
because we have to have to %uh

206
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,180
streams yeah so sometimes and it breaks
the course well

207
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,939
the Metreon of the caudal opened or the
Metreon dove head at me i'm open cast so

208
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,079
be aware

209
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,969
sometimes I the patches do not apply

210
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,740
but right now with no patches to 11 p.m.
and just the condo

211
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,970

cant I can't hear

226
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,060
from the beginning of 2002 mentioned
called his factory

227
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,239
what are the goals of the cold in fact
we New Zealand p.m.

228
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,360
yeah I'll so by the

229
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,209
I E year these kind of okay so

230
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,430
I for example going when when

231
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,719
a check in at Google happens they come
highly for production with TCC

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,810
but at in parallel with with clang

233
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,529
for the debug output and for they how I

234
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,800
it instrumented like that for a kind of
the most obvious

235
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,930
stop whole the UK kind of yeah I

236
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,420
recurring Aeros they can even find out

237
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,099
through clang what's wrong and kind of

238
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,320
proposed a patch already yeah I thought
that kind of the

239
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,709
I what's possible we could

240
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,319
kinda do it aspirants version

241
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,550
whatever yeah or I'm a

242
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,000
cokie may like tools with

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,779
clack yeah to find info to fix a

244
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,370
issues in the caudal but the right now
that's just

245
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,790
ID years but that's no specific work on
that right now

246
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,819
okay from

247
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,240
regarding the to do with me
variable-length scenes

248
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,390
person celo via maintainer said no they
did not gonna supported so the to do is

249
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,399
to remove all of them from the Linux
kernel

250
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,130
and do you have currently pensions
touching them out of my house which

251
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,399
should house for a few thinks

252
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,920
mostly it's not that hard to move

253
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,420
thinks out of the structure yeah it's
kind of just

254
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,010
moving it out and accessing it just a
direct result that's not the point the

255
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,790
problem if

256
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,910
its at the moment it's Houston the few
crypto bits

257
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,120
and right now the maintainers I am NOT
in favor of changing it

258
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,940
and so if that makes probably need some
time

259
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,790
I home and some well time to call in
seven

260
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,390
I'm the problem is now that code gets
copy and paste that

261
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,790
minor steps that's our our main problem
right now we have a few patches

262
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:08,490
I for a.m. some wind upstream like the
USB get a day pass your state

263
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,150
and we met the maintainer and say that
okay that's that's just do with that

264
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,390
so I in principle yes

265
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,800
yeah we would have to find and to remove
all the area

266
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,399
places we have reduced place it will not
be supported

267
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,329
and so if if there's a driver using it
because it was calm

268
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,940
comfortable to use it then it won't work
and I need to to fix it

269
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,100
million yeah okay okay thanks

270
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,520
do thank you for your call
