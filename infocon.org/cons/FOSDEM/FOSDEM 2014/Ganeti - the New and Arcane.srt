they data collectors but reporter on
with k2 summit of the wilder

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,850
the want to just give you values but
don't have a particular

116
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll hole broke in the case right we
don't know how broken it is if you're

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,570
just getting the ball

118
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,380
let me know all that if the Mathur is
not responsible 9

119
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,090
broken hopefully there will be
information lol

120
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,979
so just where in the mall all walks with
me

121
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,469
it's not old indicated read-only just
put it on our private industry if I want

122
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,990
to

123
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,330
we don't care disable it if you don't
mean are you

124
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,849
but like what me to come into the world
all

125
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,669
then basically you can go and check
which collectors you have a

126
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,219
and then CI overall collectors or query
one collateral

127
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,330
pacifica the venue long-haul routes it
to me

128
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,440
information and your phone model

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,680
govern information on the new your old
number crunching is that the sticks

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,380
method so no configuration demon Kompany

131
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,449

135
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,880
what I've been told me there was in
terrible alcohol before law

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,190

137
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,050

conversion Houston using me for 2.1

139
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,310
please upgrade like yesterday anybody
who is already one home doing

140
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,330
no victory we got linda bloodworth

141
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,280
saw arm you had lost my mother come late

142
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,169
for information about what all followed
your config data they they are you could

143
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,029
really from the lot more from another
planet but

144
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,969
it was a bit complicated I very powerful
thing they come on when you are you

145
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,639
don't love me rocking out to the local
now

146
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,519
when you know the kind information now
the mother being dollars already bad

147
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,410
enough look

148
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,300
but from pole you still want law which
all parties where

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,969
even if your lololol replacing them up
in the meantime

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,199
I mean if a mother is all okay maybe you
come from

151
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,910
migrating to these are you come to a
create a new one but

152
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,160
is to have a local in the car up and
that

153
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,819
you want permission about so how will
that mean company

154
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,550
arm there'll come a little small blip
even within

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,050
a thought but these are we cover
everything

156
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,760
unsold we will leave it was killed a
bottle local appoint a failure to access

157
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,740
this other day top solvers this
information config date %uh

158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,790
we didn't do you read only as usual
while I clean only because it easier

159
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,149
arm an excellent method so

160
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,779
who are almost total the

161
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,779
I'll will provide more information
although being in jail are you alive

162
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,540
well what about the IP is in case you
lost rock a former while

163
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,010
all and then you want to go into it do

164
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,290
like and pots or worry or other all

165
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,969
they're all in all it marked the end of
line is no longer play all

166
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,690
what the primal or the old all what are
all the fickle

167
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,680
early prime raping your mother Colette
in the rain doesn't worry because

168
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,069
company libraries itself movin

169
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,430
to update the math account info in a bit
of rock and

170
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,779
you're flying the couple have lost them
in promoting another couple old

171
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,120
as long as they normally from must
accommodate missed in a bit

172
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,240
they can figure out the new virtual New
lifter and

173
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,690
South think with the working liberation

174
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,820
are no what I mean with a beam worth no
primary

175
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,950
are merely I woolworth Iran which in
Persian original

176
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,220
you can implement more players for
company

177
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,470
all but right now this is what it
provides

178
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,100
and for you the protocol it sold
included lynch mob

179
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,890
so you'll tune or shared secret with the
copter before even playing company

180
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,080
called me

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,370
prime America Merrill you don't want to
charged in the world

182
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,230
Bart it'll kept it so I really like this
I grow some balls

183
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,390
or you just know all that people cannot
call your partner a problem

184
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,029
about they can fill all read they also
think they carry the Euro

185
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,680
which it baton to look everybody carried
a mirror hope

186
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,899
are and then there's a time stomping de
chocolate

187
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,149
in working order a player talks too much
and so on it also covers the AP from

188
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,149
source or

189
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,709
they come like route the directions all

190
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,599
arm and how the protocol work

191
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,240
so you have a client and you said your
post about what they've done it with a

192
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,089
leaping

193
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:35,010
summer when we get lost some replies
will get lost some local we are flying

194
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,870
you don't care in the world to wake you
don't have time out you don't have any

195
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,769
sort of problem in PCB

196
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,930
and then summer when we look like just
reaffirm

197
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,260
all the older ones who signed when you
have time to look at the little about

198
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,160
Paul

199
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,510
new home with some reply I'm reply
contains a very show

200
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,029
so that you can wait until you get
enough for bowel

201
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,570
let's say 30 don't think they're going
up from the riverboat

202
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,839
and then just company with global hey
there was an update going on in the

203
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:01,540
meantime

204
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,339
and you have hopefully up-to-date
information

205
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,950
and you will acquire the morning to get
more and more up-to-date information

206
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,440
only the protocol how it worked I'm
gonna noble who all the cool

207
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,519
bout you can go back to the lives and
have a look at it

208
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,100
and also to the design of a long table
saw

209
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,000
leave a reply to

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,560
and on the waffle so

211
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,410
their are client that you can rule that
you don't need to write your company

212
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,079
all for the overflow pliable vital role
Costco

213
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,620
you need another language go ahead the
you going to the client would probably

214
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,839
integrated neither

215
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,440
or you can tell a player they then but I
mean

216
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,800
pay you have that within the problem you
he replied

217
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,750
were

218
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,200
saw lot a lot of close air support a law
clerk like you know

219
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,300
who Laura the whole truth or Google me

220
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,810
or anything let little are right now we
move forward problem ordering the mall

221
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,719
to get information from the know that we
need to get facebook

222
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,620
a new car of a lot more mark or Mike the
other uses

223
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,860
unlimited local knowing nothing at all

224
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,120
two topics that were contributed by
janette

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,709
our partnering wreath all

226
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,109
saw in the journey but won't interrupt
me and save it I'm

227
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,110
eliminates all rolled into one on

228
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,850
bout yes saw all these lights are

229
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,360
borrowed in part by from ETS

230
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,620
saw curveball the final how a little
machines connect to the network

231
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,290
you give it a lot other all which is
usually found nothing but I think 14

232
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,810
government generated

233
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,250
I may be other if you want with optional
linker

234
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,060
which is usually a bridge you can make
your neck to and the mold

235
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,160
which is Bridget or altered most of the
time it's rather write

236
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,399
I prayed or and I'll normal with Manuel

237
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,589
it may be going to jail arm your
interface to the bridge

238
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,880
nominated by your all the little leeway
you can connect

239
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,700
rushing into almost anything with you
I'll bout

240
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,220
but not enough to ride you can you will
get a brawl input

241
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,950
some role are you willing how will we
figured all convertible how do you know

242
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,690
which machines are all in the same
collision domain well walkway

243
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,870
reinventing

244
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,010
which ones were have the same name for
the global David

245
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,459
what harder all the law when you want on
your machine which

246
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:49,119
I P you want to know wouldn't have these
cultural well we have a giant machine

247
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,760
that they

248
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,399
somewhere in the valuable well that just
you for thinking the norm

249
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,700
%uh okay know that you're going with
this week war

250
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,950
woke up but yeah saw lucky maturity but
didn't have the solution also

251
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,029
moving into the little world and I think
so what did you think that we're

252
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,620
you know they're basically sad which
could be home to maine are your machine

253
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,440
all right saw for to create a network
and then we'll say

254
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,709
when you create a machine actually when
you create a niqqa

255
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,819
mitnick is a network and

256
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,910
also the network support my people so
they

257
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,230
if you specify that the machine had when
I P it gets holding the ball and if you

258
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,010
don't always say opal

259
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,750
the boiler just number it today AP and
give it to you and you can also borrow

260
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,250
some Asian thing

261
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,060
mules are reserved for my little people
and saw don't ever give those away

262
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,130
because

263
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,240
but not to be used without connecting

264
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,709
arm solve it existing Parekh flexibility
in their

265
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,899
you can think of you're not my will but
if you don't want to

266
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,899
with how to Harwood what underneath and
sort of them thought that a bit more

267
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,529
saw gym tonight will be in jail up

268
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,449
tool on top of conflict data I thought
just basically

269
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:10,769
hadn't I think was not sure overall
dress you'll

270
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,480
were keeps your Nick para meterse

271
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,699
co lop peer network name but it's just a
little more action

272
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:24,290
in thermal if you will to actually make
me making the whole literally

273
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,480
depending on the letter within me new

274
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,880
arm hope and other cool

275
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,459
and the journal people have also written
something source which I'm going to go

276
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,500
from now

277
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,209
salt thereof is the third steps but they
provide which are at senator can FH

278
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,349
yet mom and a fair the HP

279
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,760
CPD hold on to that name

280
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,089
and GPAC

281
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,829
I don't know anyway I'm and a

282
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,540
yep so I think if not work is

283
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,810
what vehicle ottoman old leather connect

284
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,339
beans are machines to the networks i'm
for both a bit more than the default

285
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,119
came here with uploaded.net

286
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,279
all and then you with another needs to
be me

287
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,059
to actually help you give the machine
the actual

288
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,089
reali p all I'll

289
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,938
with your life will look more like you
see love you to her number update you

290
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,240
with all the logical

291
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,190
I you have again the third wouldn't be
updated when a machine is created the

292
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,370
and things like that are and if they
should be

293
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,989
is big enough you also you create a
little more rules

294
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,840
and will put on another you or your use
the request from me

295
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,959
both and didn't know who this year has
been the norm that

296
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,989
then can apply to lay those who told you
willing to have

297
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,460
are you should be server also ringworm
network

298
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,830
this is used for because this way home a
DHCP server on which the old rather than

299
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,220
one centralized lot on the network and
even more stable because

300
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,470
your dinner thirteen other go down
unless all your machine from that no

301
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,869
good are the same time

302
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:08,509
through the stuff because it was it
doesn't like it month and

303
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:13,059
arm so your within holder

304
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,080
islander when this is an example you can
just other new network

305
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,090
specifying which IP range in use what's
the gateway and always will be

306
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,320
pathfinder yeah I know if they should be
tooling

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,700
both right our own if you target with me

308
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,950
and efficiently and it will be action is
home to %uh

309
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,470
using nfte speedy otherwise not and then
your

310
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,210
connector arm the network to

311
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,269
in or rule because the original nope you
might have another political union

312
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,289
suppose one old groups are

313
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,350
in the for Nathan third where everything
you need visible different numbers

314
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,019
because they're not for people

315
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,940
want to harm your no but the wait to get
back to them

316
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,720
yup saw then you can create anything

317
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,100
and tell it well this is the NetWorker
of but Nick

318
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,330
trial and you need to specify anything
anymore because

319
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,428
it one more depending on the dole group
which bridge the commitment to

320
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:12,720
and if you will a great label so we'll
all go to the other

321
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,279
you have the up-to-date information you
know life with me

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:19,639
completeness 3 from the phone to you
regular

323
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,738
like arm okay

324
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,869
until I and then you can also query like

325
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:31,049
with a little over with a local to see
what

326
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:36,359
when the good well new although that
would look like they were also told them

327
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,668
all before

328
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,879
and though thing multiple war when you

329
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,908
you're looking for old time they will
get another big night

330
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,210
gateway in everything from an F tht BT
anderson et network

331
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,649
at work together for work

332
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,559
are you can have a lil character
wherever water polo

333
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,178
a nothing keeping me get the ball very

334
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,580
to know more about it there's a package
for Debian so you can just download them

335
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,779
we not get

336
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,090
and they will tell you how are you doing
with time

337
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,769
just throwing them to foster what about

or couple who will perform as well saw

340
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,509
before a storage we just heard in five
gonna key

341
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,609
all the thought right now we had plainly
compile

342
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,220
which are just what again this time by
this we had your be with you

343
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,330
was your way not to have in us and then
we had showed file in case you have the

344
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,039
Directorate

345
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,349
orchid war machine for arm I B four
suffer

346
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:45,908
book level in this class Barack what did
you have a natural not

347
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,159
right they didn't deliver lumber home
nothing because I

348
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,749
they sort of gotten for free you know
they've been together with the nation's

349
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:57,119
arm and then what we were doing in they
will not let

350
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,269
creating more volume low volume but also
exporting it my woman told

351
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:05,080
unknown associating a call from a
blocked them and it doesn't scale at all

352
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,999
because we need to migrate think doesn't
matter anymore the volume on this is

353
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:12,179
your local lolololololol so

354
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,529
luckily mature people had the same
problem but

355
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:19,820
also had a lot of time and developers
the money from Germany and Italy not

356
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,960
just a hint until they created arm

357
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,529
this interfaith the people can also
connect your not what are the perot info

358
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,769
local admin on the phone frightful you
mike is not likely maybe I won't do

359
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:32,759
something I'll

360
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,419
so what do you do well you just
basically

361
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,849
create a bunch of skirts your former
low-wage so if you look at the mall

362
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,168
doing in March you who poker and I'll

363
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,419
new basically connect descriptor your
love I will you make it

364
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,989
are for all but it'll work for Livable

365
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:56,479
will make this will create a provider
for your life

366
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:02,599
for example laptop you have a local or
ideal

367
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,139
also keep people anyway

368
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,439
%uh yeah he will kill your baby and open
source solutions will

369
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,309
but you really haven't ripe are

370
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,519
saw every provider provide methods

371
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:21,039
let me think 2002 your back in storage
and all things on it so

372
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,769
we must be a way to create a disc all
the backup appliance

373
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,149
rebel grotesque a touch a disc told

374
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:31,268
are the ship's up

375
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:35,229
%uh any make a date I'll and very far
away

376
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,919
the broiler it felt supported are rooted
in case you have a lead well

377
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:42,359
are we gonna found something as for
example which

378
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,809
up for america and New a political party
the cue the same

379
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,940
how to learn from it can provide I'll

380
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,710
saw how the provider actually look like
well

381
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,769
executable for all the action

382
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:01,099
and then they are from type of well

383
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,418
behavioral are expected in from Bible
returns in some 50

384
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:08,729
arm merman voluble that we pass

385
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:12,690
to your script in order for you to be
able to law what's going on

386
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,889
so wasn't even those trips the talk to
your

387
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:19,418
back unfolds though wall worth or

388
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,940
right saw the call will grow big

389
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,259
up for are helpful which provider

390
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:30,090
in at you really like is it the again
when I don't look now

391
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,428
cool another love this layout though

392
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,450
with overall worth Oracle

393
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,700
our local and the like really worth
medical

394
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,009
per month by the Vista other miserable
when this

395
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:46,659
grow local all will like racial works

396
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,549
behind the school in with two
implemented

397
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,590
are finally your provider they said
supports

398
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,369
ex-lover meters so those were leaders
must be verified by the Health Dept

399
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,249
and then they can be used in any
arbitrary way which we don't know them

400
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:01,729
all

401
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:05,869
because we don't know what your provider
is not true

402
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,908
on and then the government will get
exported

403
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,619
and environment variables

404
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,009
saw when he both or you get the way to
diagnose your

405
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:22,219
are back in third with and you get away
to do

406
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:25,330
like with information about them

407
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,428
I and these are the month pages from the
design doc which we are going to talk

408
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,009
about before

409
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:34,169
I'll except to like the current
implementation

410
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,759
so clearly no

411
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,899
thank you very much are very both

412
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:47,899
yes

413
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:58,478
place such side

414
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,639
saw all we plan to have a week a page

415
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:04,799
I'll probably go clinton also will be
the container of

416
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,739
the lake thought nothing to him when we
can put it better also if it's good

417
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:09,409
enough

418
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:14,330
and you're confident the great idea I'll
just shouldn't put it in the parable for

419
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,309
you in the examples directory

420
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,379
so that with a good way if you don't
feel like trying this he lay on this

421
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:21,269
year old folk

422
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:26,190
when the website of or something or
someone tried to put it on the Wii keep

423
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:33,190
yep

424
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:36,529
are scenes 2.0 think not

425
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:41,710
much a little mean which berchenall of
my domain so much is all some pics in

426
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:48,710
but yeah I'm I don't remember if it's
the 1 7:30 128

427
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:57,509
are did you have trouble seeing it
through trial on me Doral

428
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,178
all

429
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:13,850
now thoroughly

430
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,030
couldn't actually stop it in a
meaningful way

431
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:24,030
rule

432
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,990
mmm elizabeth Rose ability elected not

433
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,590
perfect yet I don't even know if I'll
continue implementation will look like

434
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,990
yeah lexii or something the but yeah if
you feel like

435
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,820
working on it don't think we do it's
about you but we don't want to be

436
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,110
production right now

437
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,929
so it's a bit harder to and like there's
no there's would have changed quite a

438
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,310
bit

439
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,679
Sol I don't know mania from boy did
nobody this will remove it or someone

440
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,940
want to take care of it

441
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,680
we can updated well yes

442
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:07,680
him first ball

443
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,970
ok

444
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,250
yep

445
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:24,920
there are hopes so you can definitely do
that your

446
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:31,920
syrup

447
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,790
soul there is that many support for both
ipv4 and ipv6

448
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,168
I think we think doesn't have the pool
implementation is for the number

449
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:50,169
whether should work like you could right

450
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,550
okay I I don't remember I know also

451
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,399
in came in three different coaches we're
happy to have a BB 60 network or

452
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,490
I mean to be fair you could specify or
fake IP address and then your script

453
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,600
mock past the JP but of course it would
be great if you do not recall the

454
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,840
supported the yes yep

455
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,840
ya go on 10 the posh don't be lazy

456
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:35,150
and the party don't be lazy okay

457
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,230
also Google

458
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,030
the matter as prominent

459
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,030
and videos

460

502
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,590
the initial loan will jock the using the

503
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,918
open the fish command rather than
dollars Monday then you have to do

504
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,630

505
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,970
on your opinions which it's not that
hard to get so

506
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:12,970

508
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:24,660

legal fight

509
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,110
unalterably mobile usage and then my or

510
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,570
even some local church meant that the
although the globalization will want it

511
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,360
all

512
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,540
but maybe even if you look in the mood
by mobile home alone with his

513
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,480
normalization for the only thought

514

doing impulse buy it look like federal
research migrate fobel's its moderate

515
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,350
