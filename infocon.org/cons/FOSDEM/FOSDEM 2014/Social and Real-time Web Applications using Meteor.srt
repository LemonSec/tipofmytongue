1
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,599
or next week you're allowed to

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,969
to grow the he likes to read also to

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,680
I'd look at about to open source you
like to play some sports

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,420
their socks movies how Indians

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,140
this is some I Drive your boundary any
real dork a boner so sad about time web

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,930
server using ser mi tio

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,930
lets a frozen thank you

8
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,579
okay show violent me getting started
guide

9
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:56,579
I guess I'm just stuck

10
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,220
okay

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,630
on show hello and welcome to go this
media session

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm pairing of two

13
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,090
care 5 foreign detainees I am

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,340
view on me dr. so my explanation

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,390
video homer I don't know very small in
production

16
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,410
on how you can quickly develop secure

17
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,649
with applications primarily socially and
time but applications using media

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,720
so meet dr. as Ave deviation framework

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,810
and I'm just like all the other
JavaScript fam buck said as

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,970
very secure and already prosto Venice I

21
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,229
modern-looking about the cations so what
is

22
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,039
idea and I'm application so basically I
DM application is so nothing but what

23
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,070
you have been using since all these
years

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,750
you have been using who hiii you have
been using

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,310
Google Docs you have been using cause
suggest get her back

26
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,369
so all the stores that connects to you

27
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,479
event the other users in a collaborative
manner and out without any delays

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,640
on you can see I done guys real-time
applications

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,920
so as some are complicated I Z mess on

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,950
creating real-time applications using a
meaty are

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,119
as not I am already difficult now

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,200
so piece of cake

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,298
is a phrase that I can use what is media

34
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,110
to me dr as how many supreme look at it
on you

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,500
had to say it has not graduated 2x4
stable release

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,130
but are X preview really is stable
enough to help you bury

37
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,700
enterprise-class I'll good obligations

38
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,149
so it is an open source back from
mandingo

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,720
forbidding top quality in the box in a
fraction of the time when are you an

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,739
expert developer

41
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,310
are just getting started me dr.

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,410
relies on seven principles so

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,510
data on the wire so again I i do not
need anything at all

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,989
arm many days over here best quick
overview

45
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,250
so date on the fire which means and I i

46
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,750
you don't need to so I if I can jump in
a JSP are ASP or PHP

47
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,760
you communicate with a client that is a
browser

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,000
by sending the entire to you I press the
logic

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,919
so what that means is you crunch for
HTML CSS and JavaScript content over the

50
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,820
last in this case

51
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,130
you've been gone into that all you mean
transfer is that the top

52
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,260
so the UI I'm the JavaScript everything
is setup

53
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,130
I did the meeting go mend I meet our
obligation and watching up also

54
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,760
one language JavaScript beer so much I
couldn't day

55
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,899
meet lying second day Josh Kerr

56
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,549
is the only language in that unit
database everywhere

57
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,410
so me dr. has a focus on the top

58
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,510
and %ah you know it is not surprising

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,899
and I i from maintaining us are not copy
of the database

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,979
it also maintains I blind copy of the
database

61
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:19,419
so I have come to the Obama
behind-the-scenes

62
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,969
leader so just not latency compensation

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,970
so you we are all you stole using come
modern

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,130
so sure does like Twitter and Facebook
not the most important thing about this

65
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,889
story this

66
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,260
the speed and a half the speed is not in
there and even probably

67
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,789
not come back to the site's so how do
these sites achieve

68
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,880
such make speeds lead into compensation
is that dumb

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,419
so are me dr. rainy

70
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,729
simplifies things a composition one this
really means is

71
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,770
and I've a whatever can thank you

72
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,139
post are they their work and thank you
kid from

73
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,900
a steroid as immediately shown in your
US I'm

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,719
therefore strictly to do you have a
spark fish from the database

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,040
so this helps in achieving any any time
they deactivated

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,460
so picture brings me to the next point

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,750
for stock reactivity which means Ave
never your application is in directing

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,740
their daas

79
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,700
for example if you have a list of cool
items whatever you

80
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,960
entering the US com so Villalobos

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,229
win on this the AJAX call that you make

82
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,890
you don't have to wait for the success
function to execute I'll just all the

83
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,820
changes will

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,370
automatically and immediately they
reflect in your you out

85
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,380
and down that this morning NZ
compensation

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm a doctor also I happens to be one of
the aspects of

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,610
reactivity and of course the activity
also means

88
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,670
that the you can have said that indeed I
V bus

89
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,020
that well automatically refresh if any
of the detection Jess

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,630
so for example if you have no idea to be
devoted name

91
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm down the name stored in the database
somehow

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,320
changes I may go to be automatically
reflected in the US without

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,590
you ever refreshing the page I'm a star
ecosystem

94
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,179
so but instead of in reinventing the
mean

95
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,620
what may be ordained Voice it basically
you showed an existing open-source

96
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,550
technologies

97
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,510
so I come to wear done in the next life
Mike Tom

98
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,890
a is really just embracing the ecosystem
and

99
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,039
and/or many developing everything on its
own

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,740
although army TR as a good and piece of
cord

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,840
Iron Dog the truck bomb it is really
based on

102
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,710
nor digest and mom would be simplicity
quest for activity so

103
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,460
arm if you go to the from me brap I duno
designed everything is very very simple

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,760
straightforward and documentation they
paid a commission pages that are really

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,980
the only thing that you will ever need
to learn

106
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,850
media so what is behind the scenes or
did what does so

107
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,090
I meet dr. what I was we got so I put in
order to JS

108
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,138
on this airsoft again now the nation
phenomenon

109
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,430
I and Donald Duck yes really I'm bakes
JavaScript for the server side

110
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,950
so this is hard IMET hola mi Dr is ever
to achieve server-side JavaScript

111
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,820
so I did is on me again jim that was on
a button but of course

112
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,060
Mongo DB as I was very popular nor
secord a dovish on that Mahmoud BB

113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,020
the same tax is not very familiar are
cool what SQL is like

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,190
it is so many similar gorgeous on and
I'm

115
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,660
so data recorder piece of had advises
again I'm

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,990
under templating engine and I i media
use this

117
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,090
I'm down a the handlebars certain taxes

118
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,909
what croatia reactivity cleo de facto
again the activity means

119
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,770
whatever attended and unattended on this
is automatically reflected in the US

120
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,440
what agenda and the UN ice automatically
taken back to the apt

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,889
new campus so me dr. is secure

122
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,490
some before I income proceed further so

123
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,190
even though me Dr as not to have a
destabilizing coming to stay but stage

124
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,919
right now

125
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,799
1.0 denny's is not out but media is
really sick you're

126
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,360
i'm dumb they have a decent team blonde
and a huge fortifications

127
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,160
they have from and they have introduced
and diaphragm bucks to make sure that

128
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,260
every meet our obligation is very simple

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,338
allowed in Ireland's make sure nice job
by you know

130
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,419
your client side code gets too long day
so are you innu that I have got up

131
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,639
attention hack it can not actually

132
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,639
I open the console of Firebug harlem
dying to get the console and grown

133
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,860
and stock to executing certain functions

134
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,420
among the BB injections and checks are
already made in

135
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,430
Gulzar policies I did forced so you can
actually

136
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,569
I'm 11 edged out of Charlotte
cross-browser domain

137
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,850
across to mean policy oMG to make sure
that people are not a weirdo

138
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,410
embedded applications in iframes and
other such things

139
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,660
so this is among the first line our
slideshow

140
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,769
actually make show I elaboration on the
set up in to post a security principles

141
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:16,190
of

142
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,690
me dr. these to check it out isolation
is very simple

143
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,230
does this come mind as always what you
need and Dom

144
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,389
operating inside the invitation but
because this was mean

145
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,519
government Linex in mind and Macintosh

146
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,670
so me dr. update is only come on Dec you
would ever need

147
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,620
to update any after you have installed

148
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,640
painting any obligation is already
shaped rubber three dumb mines

149
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,960
mean PR create my apt to miami is the
name of an obligation of course you

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,120
wouldn't want of six names

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,890
of course mired down when you create an
application

152
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,910
I'll meet dr. automatically inserts

153
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,930
said in court and down and acorde of
course you can now

154
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,779
I change you can modify by diet is a
very good starting by

155
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,450
so you even don't need to go to the
documentation Carolina

156
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,680
but you can earn right now I S COLONY DR
I can you need his critique um I'm shine

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,439
get shot maybe they don't have my it is
so easy

158
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,500
so this is how I meet dr. application
looks like

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,770
so it is n MVVM I can picture

160
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,470
so a date is Oct line for now and it is
a public folder

161
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,920
and ended up Sarah Florida so whatever
content

162
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,630
outcomes and their client is on it is
executed on the client side

163
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,900
whatever I'm conventionally comes in the
summer

164
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,050
as executors on the server side so

165
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,279
client is a browser server is the media
center are the norm done JS ever turning

166
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,460
Honda actress Sarah so mom

167
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,650
of course are all this is G escort and
our the client will automatically

168
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,910
an indigenous 300mg escort but the
server

169
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,620
we'll have to convert the GS quote
Antonio de mexico de Vos

170
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,279
so that they can be I entered as a poor
bikes

171
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,610
and Dom this rate I such I whatever
comes into the public folder is never

172
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,720
executed be there on the planned on the
server

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,140
so things like %uh resources yard images
or videos xxx

174
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,290
come under the Public Order so arm

175
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,980
this morning I JS is one thing that is
outside of any on the shortest

176
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,130
so whatever contenders for under I I
documented that lies in their old of the

177
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,610
application

178
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,120
that according to go dare on board the
blind and the server

179
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,550
and of course derided a sec then reverse

180
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,849
and the conditions are leveling the ABS
I've

181
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,839
petrovic you can make sure that I me in
on you are dealing then

182
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,800
bought the blind and the server and I'm
going to organize Reynoso

183
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,189
are you can put the condition if me Dr
Dog his client execute this Court

184
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,960
es medio December I think your Disqus so
I'm generally

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,630
I pride in their hold on the starting
point of your application

186
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,830
so that is why these are very much
needed

187
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,720
me dr. as I saying dumb operation
restore the ecosystem

188
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,750
how does it goes out number one and is
followed by many open source platforms

189
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,710
number don't

190
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,510
and I headed shoe I intend to enter

191
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,420
choosing it has two main applications
I'm using existing frameworks

192
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,729
very easy me bootstrap of his career 23

193
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,700
G could even less underscore event even
though the park today as I made on these

194
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,560
platforms

195
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,130
and I'm you know I access a matter of

196
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,290
meet dr. I'm packagename to I had the
support of one of these platforms

197
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,980
into your application

198
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,430
so I was talking about 100 bucks this
surr

199
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,130
Norman have our template looks like so

200
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,399
by template and I saw this one coming
the RX damn if I i

you can on his mind

203
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,820
these are the activity bus video
JavaScript code

204
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,649
and of course you can have a function
that perfection data from the database

205
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,779
I'm buying data cool quest and lost and
accessing the humans is really easy

206
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,310
so in your javascript fire I you just
don't

207
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,930
template dog hello dog first is a core

238
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,070
I

239
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,240

nobody s

240
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,180
I love and actually deploying on the

241
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,709
cool Biochem I just ate to mention of

242
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,130
so my application is running this is how
the quarter looks like and I

243
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,220
here is how I can view it and the
browser

244
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,710
so that s

245
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,500
my application and I if I go to the
console

246
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,320
on there is so I actually

247
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,290
are taking on this but then actually
outputs to the console

248
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,589
so this month and it shows a reactor
hand and is based on

249
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,520
on this template yeah

250
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,599
so hello is a template

251
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,939
and reading as any activity up okay I
and II

252
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,730
let me just finish by contrition solo
basically

253
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,050
little island is also very easy you have
Booga minus media are deployed Mitch

254
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,669
had to deploy it on the media center
itself so if you want to

255
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,870
if you are okay but having a sub-domain
on the media website

256
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,159
this is what you get and you can even
buy and then

257
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
about vacation and if you like it on
your own server that has

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,180
protection board game known .gs I don't
want to be in stock

259
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,210
that's only thing that Rooney does
someone have a quick question

260
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,950
capture this as

261
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,050
gone yes yes

262
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,169
absolutely okay is it possible to
install reason p.m.

263
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,030
so I N p.m. is out a very much
integrated into a more dangerous and

264
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,820
that is what

265
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,080
I also on issues test

266
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,060
all duracell hey I'm right on the server

267
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,780
I meteorite is another thing that you
can use my to of course

268
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,480
and then we get our cause and then I
used to use nvm on the predictions have

269
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,210
arrived at this

270
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,170
and is it possible to imagine
application where did the

271
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,320
the user we love debtors into the locals
to rage that the server doesn't know

272
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,419
like to have decentralize application

273
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,380
weaved the the client's having now using
the database in soda

274
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,910
the client results uploading them to
server

275
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,450
is it possible on

276
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,320
sorry I didn't get your question like 22
lets the client's

277
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,460
the manage data and a brother

278
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,680
pleased with your application but
without duplication re centralizing

279
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,650
the data I am the control of the
database that opened the dovish

280
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,660
is set by this government upset right
Davis so you can arm Jetstar

281
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,700
I am create a database on your own

282
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,720
and Outlander dovish and bring all your
automatically be created by our

283
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,850
obligation and the April positive is
missing too with us said or did I miss

284
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,889
there is nothing that you can do with
that so you cannot many really doesn't

285
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,410
just apply under Davis and not
necessarily the best

286
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,310
the synchronization with on this happen
thank you for your torch

287
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:22,210
