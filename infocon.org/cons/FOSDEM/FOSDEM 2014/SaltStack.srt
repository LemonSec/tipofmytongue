and cycling's

847
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:16,299
all but sounds better get back with yeah

848
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:21,280
with the additional data we have about
10 and things like that just said

849
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,599
to distinguish between install no and

850
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,710
are between destructive tasks and
non-destructive past

851
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,109
lower nose burns yes stalled

852
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:35,848
so behind that is from this is the

853
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:39,069
no supply-sider in both reviews holes

854
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,890
as I think that there's just too hard
for people to use

855
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:49,890
better

856
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,000
we don't have yesterday revoked
certificates and

857

862
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,509
I her dogs bonds service and router

863
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,529
your house things my understanding is
that they

864
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:37,369
was much more without my Motor
Corporation

865
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:40,950
agree razor resonator

866
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:44,839
their to strike a balance between yeah
hardware

867
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:47,600
sentry and does

868
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,690
the way people use used to do physical
home

869
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,880
and third the Magners because it just
doesn't get out of

870
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,830

happy by giving them a disservice

871
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,040
now as a just nah

872
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,770
expected there because of the
differences between miles

873
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,230
makers

874
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:18,230

875
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:34,640
moms there

876
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,240

whatever you can do with poppers

877
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,578
do with mom because their hardest thing
to

gomer this is a

892
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,649
the smallest imagery there was nothing
to change from and

893
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,800
nor an arms learned

894
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,890
the rationale behind that movie is that
