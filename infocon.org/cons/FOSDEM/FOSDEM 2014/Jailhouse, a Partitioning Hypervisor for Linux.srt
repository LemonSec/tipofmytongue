1
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,810
up

2
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,030
group

3
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,400
okay soul

4
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,909
well however long arm for the last talk

5
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,070
of the motorization track today near arm

6
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,649
so I'm pleased to present a project here
so I saw anyone

7
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,520
attend my talk in Edinburgh almost
that's good

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,500
because or was it will feel some apply
for a repeat there's an impressive talk

9
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,040
so

10
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,660
I'm going to talk about and you have a
fighter arm

11
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,920
costs and also I which is being used for

12
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,910
petitioning the Nexus times so I'm
looking for Siemens SEC on the slights

13
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,579
I'm so we are sent to research and
develop an apartment arm

14
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,690
so this is not a product presentation
this is a product presentation from

15
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,959
research so please don't ask me about
product on this topic

16
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,959
I am but I will try to give some hints
well

17
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,390
this could be used solved without the
motivation for this activity

18
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,559
Anthony to happen this brown

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,320
remember approached one is different in
this case I give a status what can you

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,290
tell us about

21
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,010
I also try to squeeze in some lifetime
on it arm

22
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,540
and also argument about why you're going
up sauce for the weekly rental

23
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,480
sauce with it Apostle Paul

24
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,010
bed of several use cases where you want
basic alien a multi-core system

25
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,130
before use on and certain number of
course on the system so we want to run

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,980
basically

27
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,000
a summer's a task to 100 percent on the
score and don't be to stop

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,609
so the first thing that comes may come
in mind to unionists and some kind of

29
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,880
high speed control

30
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,769
system so weigh 120 on talk to hardware
and react on certain events at a high

31
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:36,410
rate

32
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,350
and with the low latency so you're every
microsecond counts

33
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,890
I'm but to be to achieve a higher
frequency

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,920
save related to you can get from soft
respects between you and the hardware

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,119
basically lost to achieve a maximum
control rate

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,010
I am so you want to keep basically

37
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,409
the caches active hot I we don't want to
get any disturbances from

38
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,690
other activities operating system for
example and we want to miss of course

39
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,620
very demanding deadlines and the
scenarios but there's more

40
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,970
me on typically there's also some this
is high performance computing area

41
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,640
I'm they also have interest in
dominating a single

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,909
cause a single CPU was fully simply
because they all want to keep cattle hot

43
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,930
am to the finished they are

44
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,640
populations only a and finally another
scenario

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,030
I'm I basically what we learned about
when we went open business project

46
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,200
a.m. but naw focus right now but it's
interesting valueless

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,780
is a software-based better place so if
you think about somebody finds a

48
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,549
networking you stay if so there's a
bigger payment be paid to run through

49
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,289
and if used on equipment and software
not the health services and hardware

50
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,610
on you also have the typical
requirements on a high throughput and

51
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,599
low latency bear

52
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,090
so sabina the same price you have on
this scenario for the bus an arduous

53
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,369
so what you see today I'm

54
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,770
to fulfill these requirements for
clinics the spot

55
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,010
I summarized done this config know it's
that integration options over

56
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,520
died here he is 20 to keep the next for
every model

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,000
on and dominates I'm missing a core i7
CPU

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,030
with a single UNIX task I'm thought no
interrupt on the CPU unless the password

59
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,750
precedents

60
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,930
and no maintenance work no housekeeping
woke up a minute on the CPU

61
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,720
and want to keep the front-running model
at

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,140
but this is not really trivial I'm to
talk to develop of

63
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,409
because then it was not prepared for
this right now so that ongoing work in

64
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,250
this area it since approving its getting
better and better

65
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,479
arm soul but therefore something
remaining so far

66
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,700
right now for example you still have to
run at least once per second for

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,289
maintenance

68
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,810
work on the CPU and there are other
works

69
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm which reply lol offloading what
other CPU stuff so

70
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,169
to get one free so it's not get perfect
at least anything of a long-running

71
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,440
thing they want to have really the fall
CPU over long periods without any

72
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,289
disturbances

73
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,009
I'm so it's an approach in the right
direction

74
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,039
I'm and many interesting but well lol
clots

75
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,810
which do not follow this programming or
of Unix so if you look at

76
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,900
about and %uh strengthen our city of
have some kind of pre-existing software

77
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,258
has gone like this where you have some
out was running

78
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,660
certain workloads I'm and want to
combine these workouts now the other

79
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,270
restate his mother 'cause machines was
some general purpose operating system

80
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,280
mechanics are becoming

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,190
so how to get these to get on a thing of
crap well the typical approach to this

82
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,520
is swell to use

83
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,380
but I vacation for example returning for
KVM a/c

84
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,699
so you can lift basically the
pre-existing software and virtual

85
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,479
environment

86
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,770
make sure that the virtualization is
forfeiting your timing requirements and

87
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,330
while

88
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,599
that's the approach and actually I

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,139
we also get some studies on this and
also from protons running

90
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,190
within hours don't want to details based
on the server

91
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,020
flight from a premise presentation or
presentation about making a KVM return

92
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,870
capable

93
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,240
so we measure basically no setup between
and some

94
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,370
wrote I'm virtualized notes and another
networking notes and the latency you get

95
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,680
on the wrong trip

96
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,419
on basically what we did also here is to
dedicate

97
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,818
a core to homogenization Paso to the
virtual machine

98
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,020
arm and we got in this scenario with all
this tax office ran through

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,810
KVM Puma was not involved in this
scenario

100
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,300
became up with latencies maximum
agencies about the 330

101
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,060
microseconds so depending on its own I
respect your enough

102
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,650
on other scenarios different too high

103
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,719
so even if this hiding a climbers' would
be

104
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,199
okay for you for your scenario that's
another area

105
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,319
arm 0 yeah and that about

106
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,259
I'm safe and secure scenarios was going
to be the safety seminar is interesting

107
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,650
for us

108
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,739
and then you have to go to certain
certification processor for caught like

109
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,150
with

110
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,859
I and in these pros advise you have to
look very closely at hardware

111
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,319
but also saw fest tix on so this
involves revenue testing

112
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,509
arguing about the software and possibly
some

113
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,250
for the nation's of it and law

114
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,660
simple rule Bellavia system is the
lottery software earth

115
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,840
the more effort to happen this so that
the

116
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,630
took approach to visit to spread of
holidays he had separate machines for

117
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,930
their safety on bond and the other stops
on another machine

118
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,280
these days everyone want to consolidate
so you suddenly have

119
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,929
the safety in on safety and what nixon
ariane is a machine

120
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,870
312 to separate these is well below its
in some way

121
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,670
to keep the critical components away
from all the complexity of modern

122
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,750
operating system

123
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,579
all one of Britain's back and for the
scenarios

124
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,829
well we all see that but I the Asian
could be a helper

125
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,290
with the segregation so it could
basically isolate

126
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,540
number nine us a few minutes uploads
from the senate workloads

127
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,740
on at least as far as the virtualization

128
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,360
in itself is not adding more complexity
that encapsulates

129
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,530
so if you're a rating system my favorite
ovations that becomes after complex as

130
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,870
a in the system you want to isolate from

131
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,220
yet not one nothing so for these
scenarios

132
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,589
you want some release more hype about
them a small I mean

133
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,339
he was borrowing them and something
which is really focusing on this

134
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,550
specific past

135
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,310
that means isolating mostly statically
isolating

136
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,250
workloads from each other spatially and
temporally

137
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,370
op so they are quite a few

138
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,980
solutions of an effect although the
company's market

139
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,230
arm there are many commercial offerings
on this arm

140
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,360
unfortunately they are not many
open-source activities in this area

141
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,390
the other half of restrictions arm or
they're not causing us to use cases

142
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,589
so this is our first of all one thing
what we saw

143
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,650
we want to be able to be independent of
a certain

144
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,220
solution we want to have control over it
arm

145
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,010
so you want a graph a industry parting
open source solution for this

146
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,750
so this is one area I'm we thought about
and the other areas

147
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,959
I if you develop for to my crop advisor
well

148
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,189
it takes over control over the hot with
the purpose of this so this is basically

149
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,219
what you boo

150
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,199
now instead of your if you're for a full
operating system

151
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,290
and take over control control and that
it has to boost though

152
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,089
you along critical workload isn't there
a purpose operating system it

153
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,100
and getting dust this operating system
up and running

154
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,449
with a quite complex task so the boards
for process of the gas systems

155
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,109
tickets to cut busy Inc increases the
complexity of the above I like never

156
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,809
going to be

157
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,949
wide in the end when you have a running
system

158
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,790
usually get away with much less court
involved the run time just to keep this

159
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,689
isolation between

160
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,429
non-critical workload and the critical
workloads a life

161
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,770
that's about static partitioning

162
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,799
so we thought it would be interesting to
golf or nothing approach

163
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,760
than the classic approach of putting the
hypervisor first

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,290
and this is where the jailhouse approach
comes in

165
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,469
so we boot than a frontal system

166
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,579
just as before so it takes full control
over the hardware

167
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,679
that's the buffet so and well if you
look at the better both specifically the

168
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,400
barely any operate on can pecan would
renege side

169
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,939
but then when we come to the
partitioning face so when we

170
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:46,370
once separate certain workload from the
Linux world

171
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,140
law to have either lately so we live are
running from Barbara

172
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,470
moved I've about underneath and

173
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,980
well of course could pick up a
hypervisor according to all our

174
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,280
requirements so that we have

175
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,299
partition system

176
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,559
and I we r with a

177
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,679
statically processing systems for an
ex-con excess

178
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,600
3 saw so that the real time domain s
using im Weiss was a

179
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,780
fully controlled by the hypervisor but
decide about it just has to keep the

180
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,329
system

181
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,809
and its current state running it doesn't
have to care about getting exporting

182
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:24,319
up a doc and even if you have a specific

183
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:27,479
dedicated work with on the right side
for the route on purpose or smaller

184
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,910
safety purposes

185
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,790
they also can be read using their needs
and their requirements on the

186
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,049
virtualization a

187
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:40,380
so we have to look for the right balance
for this kind of work notes

188
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,799
and that means balancing between
features of course is always the threat

189
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,360
features

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,870
and simplicity for publicity of the
hypervisor providing these features

191
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,870
and that the purpose of Jan 03 to

192
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,230
focus on the simplicity to keep things
as simple as:

193
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,780
reasonable and say not as possible overs
new things

194
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,370
more crazy more simpler about baugh

195
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,380
if we have to decide about the future
the simplicity is

196
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,939
it's very important for us

197
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:17,179
let's have a look at the whole thing all
the aspects of trails looks like so

198
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:22,870
affect we have multi-core systems have
multiple CPU sleuthing we have two of

199
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,910
them split of

200
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,360
for the real term domains anything on
the other systems

201
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,730
so how to buy those taking full control
of the hopper there's really no

202
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,750
interaction no

203
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,819
possibility of Linux from runtime: to to
bring the system down

204
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:41,520
still we need some kind of control for
its and every make use of Linux

205
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,880
so we have some kind of yeah loading
control module

206
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,559
which talk to the hypervisor which also
brings up the hypervisor as a set

207
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,880
this 1/2 paw standard interface so we
have some

208
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,429
tackle Levi s created and your this
device basically we talk

209
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,720
to load a module and weaken bring up a
system so we load the hypervisor itself

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,829
we also provide

211
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,709
configuration for the system so what
chris also saw a bear how they should be

212
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,799
provided between the instances

213
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,439
during startup and also later on when we
don't

214
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,809
peace what we call cell for the youth
real time

215
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:22,260
applications that could be 4r toss it
could be bad metal

216
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,030
whatever you would like so these are the
main components

217
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,870
that are use to get the system up and
running

218
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,049
if you see at this military has more
about actually

219
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,410
access control them true but ovation

220
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,260
so we want to manage basically the jury
the available hardware

221
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,390
in a partition qua you don't want to
much alive

222
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,470
then we don't want to all order possibly

223
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,660
so we we basically just intercept and
filter access to all the Center for

224
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,100
sauce we have in the system

225
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,870
as far as the heart but doesn't support
us in this so ideally

226
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,370
authorization provides all the means we
need

227
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,589
to do this partitioning so we just have
to configure it

228
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,010
but we can't do this because operating
companies in this regard within an

229
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,959
incomplete we have to intercept

230
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,489
and decide about a certain axis is valid
on of

231
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,559
go one year is basically to have to
avoid that

232
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,209
any seller has some kind of system-wide
impact on

233
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,589
on the other cell so simple example

234
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,620
no one should be able in this table set
up reboot the system as a whole

235
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,790
or you can crash at all but Avery

236
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,620
that means of course want one resource
assignment so we don't do any other

237
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,040
commitments we don't appoint a
scheduling

238
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,719
there's no sterile its morning for some
research topics

239
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,730
with what about recycling about this
area really we have no schedule

240
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,270
that means of course but opportunity for
a very interesting for less complexity

241
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,630
I'm good at heights much of the
hyperbolic systems

242
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,970
so we don't emulate we saw says that
missed you from one side

243
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,449
so if you bought in one of those
specifics else who will

244
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:11,609
not find typical PC hardware they are

245
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,689
because it already assigned to Linux or
it's completely blocked

246
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:19,150
for other reasons and then of course

247
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,490
keep the complex keep other legs won't
notice it because you're running

248
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,470
so it won't accept this offer anymore
even what that will befall

249
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,900
you wouldn't notice during runtime so

250
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,079
if you want more if you have a four
system is copy para vitiligo

251
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,799
got kind of paris-nice well as an hour
to be the person are you

252
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,179
yes to a KVM for this so this is
basically where we draw the line

253
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,429
between our approach Statehouse and

254
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:51,600
for virtualization approach we have up
there

255
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,750
so many gigs of ram into thin air so far
as I sat

256
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,990
woods trapping stumbling also

257
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,970
the molding you'll see an example played
on so I was just on through it with me

258
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,490
thou creation we have some kind of
Kamata interface for this

259
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,589
again reduction of the best I've eyes
are and we also get some kind of Unix

260
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,849
look and feel like the whole system you
don't have to fiddle with all the

261
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,969
modloader for example to get this thing
running you have a normal nixon varmint

262
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,650
basin use filed to party in I

263
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,039
payment service on the configuration you
can handle it on come on time things

264
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,970
like this

265
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,530
off during operation so if you want to
reconfigure system

266
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,820
your solution Luther Korean common focus

267
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,418
at least as far as the system as a whole
is allowing this so you can destroy your

268
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,049
cell

269
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,230
reconfiguring to bring up a different
configuration on your cell a different

270
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,370
cell

271
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,250
of course also enables us to use logging
moratorium for from Nixle environment

272
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,890
and shop well also shot or as possible

273
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,110
a sparse corporation lawsuit again
reduction to crack the top adviser

274
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,649
and also shot on a run past you don't
have to remove the whole system he was

275
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,980
fun to reporters on cell

276
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,200
that's to be the case if any of the
static

277
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,390
real my propa by the export during
people's faces

278
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,130
solo at this point

279
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,770
%uh another slice on a state or so we
currently

280
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,559
on focused on x86 toes was the first
developments all

281
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,700
depending of course on how to
regeneration peter secure find these

282
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
days

283
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,580
so if you were to those asian guy
fertilization he's other requirements

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,439
on we enabled target drug delivery even
if the Saban's upon whom this

285
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,280
so we have very low latencies for a time
Celso

286
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,600
if you ride in the proper way you can
even get on 20 axis

287
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,379
solar cell can run independently of the
virtualization

288
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,710
at full speed without any interaction
with our allies at all

289
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,330
during normal operation

290
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,949
we also using virtualization to bring up
the whole system so basically the first

291
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,540
developing states volcanic you look in
your

292
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,159
so we didn't look very hard to so who is
also very helpful if you want to

293
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,190
inbox the environment has been on today
it was me is also units approach to

294
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,120
develop

295
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,389
the operating system completely in a
virtual machine into the bucket

296
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,600
the same it here risk of some
interesting facts because

297
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,370
a it means method richard is a shame
you're using virtualization

298
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,729
virtualization

299
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,140
I'm so the court for this wasn't
completely stable at this point

300
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,410
are so many bugs were fixed in this area
but but interesting

301
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,970
unfortunately we are lacking right now
be teeny

302
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,130
in KVM so there's no beating even
elation available version is Asian

303
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,900
available

304
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,990
so we conquer this kind of feature in
the KVM

305
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,310
in the array of development universal
environment

306
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,300
that's why VTD currently is still
actually a soft requirement

307
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,820
have a by the Board even without it just
enable this kind of development

308
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,090
for so we went public

309
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,100
about for months ago now arm

310
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,949
and about one moved on so have extreme
into minoso destruction so we can

311
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,830
shut down the complete gutheil again now

312
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,429
I'm we have now complete support for

313
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,980
device passed through to other cell so
that means encapsulation above you may

314
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,820
request

315
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,710
sent from the device on this a small sum
commander

316
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,150
arm we have also something isn't right

317
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,440
he's in the youth have from my access
control so

318
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,570
fell switch to a certain critical cost

319
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,149
should probably not be distorted
arbitrary points we probably need some

320
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,030
kind of hot on warning at least so
basically looking implement curious

321
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,889
some interface for spa critical cells to
talk with have eyes out before executing

322
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,490
destruction come on

323
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,390
and vote against it or at least delay
this kind of an operation to

324
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,420
for a shot of their father

325
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,940
improvement on usability you so this is
still an early stage

326
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,660
on install some on corner or something
actions are better than its

327
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,120
I but it's it's step-by-step improving
all

328
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,959
so

329
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,410
and all fall of what life table I'm for
using my notebook here

330
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,210
which consists of they are not a core
CPU

331
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,810
to course with its to threats and it's
running late in front of course

332
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,669
arm and we have to devise underneath
what I'm doing basically right now

333
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,330
noting that I was of course I'm and then

334
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,510
I'm establishing I'm some kind of
special opec tables but

335
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,070
last year so a just to see what what

336
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,780
the hypervisor is doing it has a console
as the ribbons ordered under status

337
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,990
and we also uses the ribbons ordered on
a then the workload

338
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,900
because running their so basically
feeding back to serial ports for USB

339
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,020
cable

340
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,450
a to the console that can see it on the
screen here

341
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,080
but I'm going to start is a very simple
be more on a pint

342
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,490
event loop so you set up a time are in
this

343
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,830
guess machine which is triggering I'm 10
times per second

344
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,720
and measuring basically latency of this
time or I'm against the

345
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,090
known clock the ppl up precisely

346
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,659
so let me see if this works

347
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,810
okay with this year

348
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,070
assira console coming up

349
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,710
written they are under the command line
almost machine

350
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,860
saw him first of all morning of course
this helper module

351
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,899
nothing special happens for this well

352
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,850
except that in ohio for device not for
its and 2 this device note

353
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,959
um now the that to me

354
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,540
jet off to look a monitor with a very
very thin to address the problems device

355
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,620
communicating so I'm enabling now the
hypervisor on

356
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,520
with this fellow configuration for my
notebook its business writing their

357
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,310
sauce I have so much promise there where
it is precisely what city was out there

358
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,100
and so on and so forth

359
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,730
was just dunno if you look now likens
all you see

360
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,840
but what up messages I S strict about a
bit just because

361
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
I V concrete all the data yooo the
hypervisor starting

362
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,810
otherwise be 10 to Baja space in the
serial port

363
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,280
so I front on orkut so if it was on a
room a/c in half

364
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,960
a different machine attached work with
you live in OC policy actually that

365
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,530
something was cut on whether or not

366
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,970
last come on stop there so basically
it's moving up on all four paws

367
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,520
running either they are and now at this
point machine in the control of the

368
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,550
hypervisor

369
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,350
so I couldn't we want for example right
now anymore either with or if it was a

370
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,899
simple

371
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,930
so let's create some Preston R you also
again I'm using the command-line tool

372
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,420
you to create a fellow

373
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,770
with a specific configuration for its
and also specifying what should be

374
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,020
running to sell so over

375
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,170
binary image basically anywhere to be
loaded

376
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,600
and as a result so the numbers you're
not very impressive the on on a second

377
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,580
thought it was better latency of this
time

378
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,129
event loop and it's getting up even
beyond

379
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,110
twenty or thirty microsecond booked a
hot area so

380
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,729
the you but you're measuring he is not
any kind of software if you measuring

381
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,880
many for you to buy a operate in sea of
this machine

382
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,660
including chipset on all the components
and more -6

383
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,170
saw different how to be a stinging low
on numbers which

384
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,760
single-digit not a second mike is a good
performance on the iran-iraq

385
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,780
so it's running all anti clinton also

386
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,700
destroy it again so on specifying the
configuration going to elect destroyed

387
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,110
against me all not permitted to do it
that simply because the self at all

388
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,449
i'm rejecting the first repressed I'm
doing on a top-down

389
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,000
and I'm done with it I'm signaling to
the hypervisor okay no you can't destroy

390
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,930
me

391
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,450
so let's try this again and we are done

392
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,520
and we see okay the CPUs been returned
to Linux

393
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,040
and I could even apps from console

394
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,480
disable the whole thing again

395
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,480
and all the controllers back to Linux
also speculates otherwise all ordered

396
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,860
for applying one except on what you set
out to do some work on x86 environment

397
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,330
are with the dropper mappings Conley on
the work arm

398
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,679
to plucked his last hole but also

399
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,890
a.m. to access to certain desirous of us
have to be

400
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,330
moderated basically what I provider so
the astral ongoing work

401
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,840
another ok Marius I investor
communication of course

402
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,429
right now the South can only talk going
home without a vote

403
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,140
but he also has an hour has been want to
talk in between the Salsoul between

404
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,330
Lenox and a cell

405
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,659
for monitoring for starters for
controlling whatever

406
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,660
so we to establish some kind of federal
for this obviously

407
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,270
arm but not to decide what kind of
negative be used but we r

408
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,090
a big fan of reusing existing one so we
will probably leave it open close if not

409
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,800
I'll

410
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,990
are not only because it's worse than it
was also

411
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,990
portable to other non PCI Africa's for
example so very interesting approach

412
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,559
I'm so this book basically enable us to
do in this our communication

413
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,500
I for the area earth requirements to
federal safety scenario says do some

414
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,830
kinda very dangerous set up

415
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,679
so we want to proof that the hot press
brought into the state's let me know

416
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,390
what it is

417
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,200
proving that to be working and so this
is also ongoing work to do

418
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,490
some kind of mechanism for this

419
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,559
and yeah that of course the question
arises what about other sectors and

420
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,360
buttons what the

421
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,459
of receive a nasty pic archaic a
difficult life

422
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,090
but are on of course we want to be
portable not I was written in a portable

423
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,530
way

424
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,540
at least as far as me were able to prove
so far

425
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,420
on and we will go for ARM soon

426
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,130
so requirements they are are again
hospitalization support

427
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,000
so that means anything arm v7 or better

428
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,059
and also device isolation of course

429
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,760
first part of thing would probably be
some point 315 SRC

430
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,520
so most likely some action of 5 system

431
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,400
on we aren't in the discussion on this
oath guarding the question was starting

432
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,990
with the first steps

433
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,420
on so we aren't going to cause an hour
in this regard arm

434
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,720
the authentication suppliers interest as
well for certain state offense an artery

435
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,740
interesting

436
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,970
and they are a small companies are
interested in this area

437
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,490
so we are trying to call you pays your
interest and the efforts I'm

438
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,059
some communication already happened
mainly Stardust on having the background

439
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,170
I hope people

440
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,890
soon be able to have a full wrote me
basically a separate on the mailing list

441
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,420
and see who was working on what

442
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,950
should come the next week saw the next
month let's say definitely we have we

443
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,050
have some roadmap

444
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,280
which means that something will be there
by the end of q3 of this year

445
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,070
on so that basically means that we have
some kind of state that he had Dec 26 in

446
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,200
the end of last year

447
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,380
also was on the available for the first
steps but

448
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,850
of course is an open source projects or
any contribution on this area will

449
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,110
accelerate the road but of course

450
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,059
yeah open source

451
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,500
why open source so when we discussed was
also internally

452
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,760
there were some comments like well more
hot elisa means lots of the few lines of

453
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,100
code is easy

454
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,459
ride ourself to maintain our stuff I
don't go open source

455
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,309
but yeah is not an easy as it looks like
even if they are only a few lines of

456
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,410
code his hospitalization is in

457
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,559
not be beast on most architects I think
Austin Texas

458
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,899
I'm so you need to have sex but looking
on this

459
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,530
and you need to experts from different
areas with different experience behind

460
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,470
it

461
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:08,370
also is about supporting a broad range
of systems a profit off of exit off of

462
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,459
50 use

463
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,760
aborts and this also means that at some
point to get her

464
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,790
the barrio scalability of your own
resources and we want to attract others

465
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,070
to work on this

466
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,520
want to benefit of course from hardware
vendors working on this area of

467
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,610
from bought support pie done by hand by
then the

468
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,540
so is also a reason to go open source

469
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,100
and of course you want to broaden the
use XP have a certain use-case scenarios

470
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,649
in mind

471
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,820
but I see that this kind of component
could be useful for broad areas

472
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,350
so the automotive areas thing off

473
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,409
every on it possibly I'm so

474
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,140
the more we get this thing out in the
field the more it is being used

475
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,179
actually the high art test coverage we
get earlier

476
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,460
and well in the end your benefit from it

477
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,309
all it's known mister finally

478
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,530
armpits its close relation ex-con
actually

479
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,379
well the court is not part of the corona
right now

480
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,000
on but we are one of course reuse
inimical far as possible so

481
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,520
open selecting an open source also
enables us cooperation

482
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,629
and is use it definitely and

483
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,790
maybe one day in his autumn impression I
got back what about giving him the next

484
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,649
but yeah

485
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,890
why not not today probably maybe not in
five years who knows

486
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,690
but if this actually established F kind
of standard way to doing this kind of

487
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,480
isolation

488
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,770
then maybe at one point become
interesting but many don't want to

489
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,940
close the store we want to keep it open
and of course this also means have to go

490
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,270
in open source

491
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,550
is also means one reason to chew through
life in

492
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,710
so we chose license GPL arm

493
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,179
intention intentionally to keep to you
openness of the whole thing

494
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,270
I am so we want all and foster

495
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,740
that everyone was working on this and
actually prototype

496
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,190
for tigers probably is also forced to
really use

497
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,880
what he s done on these areas I'm so we
chose

498
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,530
ppl I'm we also made a clear statement
just like nicole has that everything

499
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,428
you're on a gas environment

500
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:21,150
is not affected by it that's just to
make it clear to us to avoid any kind of

501
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,550
discussion on this

502
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:28,070
so the whole thing is gplv2 just like
let's go

503
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,639
okay for summarized people who are ok

504
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,140
arm so you see now that there's a need
for

505
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,460
isolating work Lord on think of on my
the courses in specific I'll

506
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,460
so there's a need to do under stopped

507
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,590
processing work on thing of course with
low latency on I O

508
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,559
and and there's also a need to do this
with very low soft earlier stars2 half

509
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,620
for validation efforts reviews

510
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,050
they know those providing a building
block for this is not a solution for the

511
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,100
whole thing of course

512
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,050
role in building block for this kind of
all CPU isolation 100 percent CPU

513
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:12,159
to a given past want to reduce it to the
way to the mall this kind of scenarios

514
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,190
so goal is softer book after or paste

515
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,290
keep you know what let's say it ten
thousand lines of code

516
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,820
Connie R below this limit definitely and
of course when

517
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,230
adding any kind of feature this also is
important

518
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,929
requirement to keep in mind so we won't
at everything to them

519
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,390
yeah he was vinik's sawdust to have a
hand infrastructure at hand

520
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,450
so it's a different way of working with
these kind of scenario is a different

521
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,620
way of working

522
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,580
study partitioning so

523
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:47,250
thank you for your attention and I'm
open to questions

524
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:54,250
that's awesome

525
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,360
one stay up how difficult though the
area

526
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,790
how difficult was it to you um be able
to answer is often a native

527
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,020
1x was they even if he is a simple

528
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,980
everything finished sixth okay you can't
dodge curiously briefly summarize it

529
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,510
because

530
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,030
I said is that why did we had done by
out to harm consideration have a lot of

531
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,620
holes

532
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,719
so if you start up your system for
example you might not be a trick to what

533
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,310
sort of resources as a free pass from
right now

534
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,379
it should be possible so this of course
its unique thing you also have to assert

535
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,020
not fair

536
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,980
but generally what it basically is to
look what is excess

537
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,160
during runtime and then decide if this
is allowed or not

538
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,350
like you set up security policies for
supporting brought everything but a

539
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,330
moratorium ot

540
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,850
and then you look basically what gets
trapped and then you decide are doesn't

541
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,830
make sense or in its

542
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,439
some things have changed so its was
promised a simple

543
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,300
actually you

544
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,340
you you

545
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,730
when you're separating at the course

546
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,969
are you sure the course can share it no
cations

547
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:14,649
no how do separate this because the
system so nothing as far as the hopper

548
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:15,350
support some

549
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,790
with is of course the point is also the
reason why you see

550
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,460
30 twenty or thirty microsecond latency
on his course even they are both running

551
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,429
one workload

552
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,690
and the hot rare because the x86 is not
really

553
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,790
well made for the same scenario so you
get laid and see if they are

554
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,259
and and interaction between different
workloads

555
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,210
just because a Papa dependencies 3 F's
at resources like said caches

556
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,980
yes at process and things like this and
if there's any kind of support for its

557
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,949
software provide some kind of party
management for this

558
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,960
we will configure it properly and try to
enforce and then read you spend your

559
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,449
dependencies as far as possible

560
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:55,460
but if you can't then you have the wrong
hardware or you have to live with the

561
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,399
consequences

562
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,839
and one other question what about
combination OJ's house

563
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,770
and do all it KVM below it

564
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,450
all about a boy about it here and what
we have you ever

565
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,740
demo more or less so I i paper that's so
basically trying to pass through

566
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,910
virtualization

567
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,299
CPU support in a moderated way to Linux

568
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,280
so this should be possible to add new
hardware for you have for support in the

569
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,130
harbor and the two extensions

570
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,870
to do virtualization s that way it
should be quite

571
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:33,490
efficiently possible of course you will
have a sluice little slow down they are

572
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,410
but at least I got as far as running
then a KVM guest

573
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,279
inside the jail house environmental
necks porting

574
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,220
a but of course not confined so there
would be a lot of court required to

575
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,100
confine the XS Turbonetics resources -6
for example

576
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,940
so we depend on the hopper but it would
be possible supporters are now to say

577
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,780
they have some

578
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,720
nano next thermos operating system
running aside two scenarios

579
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,480
that would be way to go possibly and

580
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,760
do supporter hope you're gonna see if
you are closed

581
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,240
hurt like for instance a fair

582
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,339
for the next decide to shut down some
soup use for power management

583
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,420
the and the

584
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,549
is it

585
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:24,829
and a proviso is is it able to to deal
with this

586
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:29,660
this issue's why dependability what kind
of control you have to be for all with

587
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,499
brand to the hardware controls

588
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:35,848
menacing and so if you if you want a
shot on a sybian already physically turn

589
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:36,859
it off or whatever

590
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:39,920
and this interface has to be monitored

591
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,219
so I very fifth in hardware already
probably separate a person's

592
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,069
you if it's a person if you come on you
can say okay could do this on your next

593
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,439
reviewing a conduit

594
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:53,678
on on an exit for you that's one way to
the one on this

595
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,499
the other way is basically a total crap
all the excess and and then decide

596
00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:02,279
based on the CPU assignment of the
different cells if the excesses allowed

597
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:02,789
or not

598
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:06,869
conceptually nothing speaks against it
practically we have implemented

599
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:10,779
what we do actually a software

600
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:14,089
sipping what running right not just
because we need to

601
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:18,038
get to a CPU was off from the nixon
assign it to a different call

602
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,049
at a different cell so what you see in
the dam will be the key was sipping what

603
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:23,170
blogging software

604
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,049
so we offline one CPU for the next and a
side event a different cell phones won't

605
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:31,699
see this if you were if I would online
ad while index was not

606
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:37,289
assigned to the CPU yet a violation art

607
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:41,029
yes ok going back to the tope starting

608
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:45,009
the poem is that you l2 caches I'll

609
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:48,339
is almost always gonna be shared between
cars and they have also the

610
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:52,599
government's economic gardening between
your cost to make sure I don't

611
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:57,670
gas lines are the whole towns which we
always I think of somewhere that has no

612
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,209
don't entirely see how you can avoid it
by using virtualization because

613
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:05,899
unless you take the car art of coherency
but I don't

614
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,119
think there is any hardware which allows
you to do dats

615
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,999
into their main problem with all over
television product so far

616
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,819
that there might be some into effect the
question is are there bone or not

617
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:21,029
and this is something well we have to
also discover the operators of course

618
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:24,369
I think it's very hard to guy like
tonight's

619
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,039
boundaries for that although it might be
possible but I don't think

620
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,219
yeah and classical as MP systems are
designed

621
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:34,410
wit bounded latencies

622
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,489
guarantee Bondi lemme don't eat other
plans for me it is very close to

623
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:39,729
convince the particles

624
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:43,569
go into public lol I don't think away
its because I designed with this kind of

625
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:44,788
requirements in mind

626
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:51,789
least admire ok but I'm not sure back

627
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,829
I

628
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:01,059
and do you have any problems with
firmware in things like ACPI

629
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:05,420
SMI but the basic home I just taking
away a CPU from a seller

630
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,579
SMI is a different level again so if SMI
is happening and if its allies hitting

631
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:16,009
as I said call you have a problem just
like method of iterations so

632
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:19,299
typically what to do with the scenarios
that you have control over SMI

633
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:22,890
so you don't allow to run our Terry
viruses on your system

634
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,170
I would vary from there I that depends
of course a condo this if you are just

635
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,839
buying stock hardware usually don't have
the control

636
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,959
but if you are design your own hardware
and your interacting or a more defined

637
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,848
by us

638
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:40,640
then you may have control over this but
it is is another issue

639
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,959
generally anything which is that no a

640
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:46,979
beyond the hypervisor underneath I
provide a patrol

641
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:51,288
is can always disturb you something you
have to keep in mind

642
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:56,059
this is not solve by virtualization the
design of a property in the afternoon to

643
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:03,059
the heart in this regard aka

644
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:14,319
its

645
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,890
hi I we need dole close the room
so-and-so
