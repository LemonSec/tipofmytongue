done plenty of on house and respectful

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,950
factoring I partly past few spinoff

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,569
more data hands for less

24
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,740
arm but first thats

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,818
and ok assets Florence situation last

26
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,910
so on video Ingleside

27
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,289
must change she's not really a surprise

28
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:45,810
day positive test %ah almost yugoslavia

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,340
four-years-old yesterday's display

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,509
use stylus its there's washington's

31
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,399
the games have changed its sole

32
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,539
on Hills a this last past

33
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,289
law whatever reason I'll

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,099
II out look bus change

35
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,300
arms is faster

36
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,220
I guess to staples I'm and you mentioned

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,920
bench his well but it's also possible
like

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,290
the Iranian Hillis things

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,030
last a didn't rise I'll everything

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,170
day so I don't know

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,890
is process well August

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,149
just on the left side

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,150
by this at doing %uh

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,430
the performance in and I'll

45
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,879
you can see from this threat that I
updating the

46
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,179
find Russian this one here is an older
version about a year ago

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,269
this one yes to the US version from a
week ago

48
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,909
a Michael arafat still has to fix the
fact that it's in the wrong direction so

49
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:02,310
if

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,260
weekend see this at some point the
consider this a

51
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,108
request to fix that but so

52
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,430
what changed to have I'll one-time

53
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,219
that the performance slow down and then
recovers to pretty much day

54
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,780
original place you know what sheila said

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,799
coat up I don't know why that happened
it

56
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,569
I noticed it after it fixed itself so i
neva up by six to date

57
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,810
and just see their

58
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,480
open shed the basement shade a which
cost a performance from

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,409
but some points this was a it was
ultimately a fucking me sad because

60
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,689
state did note

61
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,810
remove redundant code me insert that but

62
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,730
gotta try this removed it so be
considered to something music and pics

63
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,700
and violate a 2006 and performance

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,069
back to the original ever and nearly had
another performance regression thats

65
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,409
I unfortunately I didn't buy it you up
so

66
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,319
I suspect that happens because updated
that machine

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,839
no 3 bitch use wheels the

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,209
this almost a but it's still on the to
do list

69
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,609
you you old but I say

70
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,109
delighted is if any of those

71
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:23,849
cost on

72
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,420
so dedication to this city Los

73
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,599
about 2,000 I p want almost like this
because it clearly shows that

74
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,819
GSA I land-based mission

75
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,050
aces use changes they'll do not fish

76
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,090
obviously years and only

77
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,460
this loss returned those well use

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,780
that she is rather slow people's or you
can see

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,679
the over the past few weeks the
performance has been

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,870
steady so rich issue updates to my best
to this the

81
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,440
or me so arm

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,560
on it writers highest

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,780
I'll see something she'd rather has seen
the

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,068
some improvements that's it you know it
I'll pick him up 2001

85
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,810
again regis from right to left so

86
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,240
something that seems to go down is
actually going up and

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,970
this improvement has its can't see that
well

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,210
the intention had been we choose to run
it is

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,729
will to frames per second settings and
running in that

90
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,430
know is eighty so this has was like to
be in the

91
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,910
she'll decision so

92
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,520
it's a nice chill I and

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,789
us each back and forth between two
slices cedars

94
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,909
they happened improvements at the same

95
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,500
times its do something that did not just

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,669
through one game

97
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,120
years yes trial ish isn't it just rolls

98
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,470
let live except for the hot essentially
soft all day

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,610

used discussed still llamas Sr he
realized his

103
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,289
up fixes

104
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:38,400
Joe now I'm back to the old once

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840

111
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,000
that be changed essential optical

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,490

to change anything will there was some
other

123
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,900
coming up of hi side

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,280
everybody who knows diagnosis wellness

169
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,930
this behavior is controlled by a fine
sitting disabled by default because it's

170
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,699
just terrible and the city's

171
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,510
force to ordering

172
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,510
usually have people by backs yesterday's

173
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,819
according please stay man's it scares

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,100
Wallace the whole thing is although
Hamas

175
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,080
team since you're right 20 rainbow you
can do this

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,170
decision cells was shed

177
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,250
for us and the

178
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,520
writing this of he is

179
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,620
much cheaper orange

180
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,370
Russia every drawer bill thanks Joe

181
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,360
and some games like or duty modern

182
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,610
a little more I S a three times

183
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,750
wise

184
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,230
the spectral so today

185
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,570
all what is best okay he then

186
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,130
game day tool 0 I

187
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,700
d its

188
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,940
31 I'll his the

189
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,340
arduous it does

190
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,090
so I'm that a

191
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,570
redone by bench us last comparing

192
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,350
inspired us by

193
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,050
don't go into that flight delays just
some bases

194
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,170
bench last sentence so policy is loss to
use

195
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,400
X just use it for polls

196
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,699
boris FX trials by because

197
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,520
otherwise is a all the this game is
twice as fast

198
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,060
US is act hands someone's

199
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,400
to assist messing around with X

200
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,680
doing yeah percentage

201
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,790
upon hence a use it with us the local

202
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,430
sweet see but

203
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,300
what it did our voices sense laws

204
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,689
I just since since you were a same
existence

205
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,510
so the service drivers is

206
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,910
that a nice anything's

207
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,329
rusty pussy

208
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,690
composting is a bit a that's most

209
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,870
in this make less as posting on

210
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,080
yes all one says

211
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,540
edge Hill

212
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,569
and on the nose I image military-style

213
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,430
Bell running at I kept

214
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,699
stop todos nasty

215
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,370
examples assistance is starting out this

216
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,540
time to me some due to the Jewish
Studies

217
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,060
is already running but as sister

218
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,790
said uses Windows

219
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,910
so that's the basic stuff solace

220
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,930
all past things I know it is

221
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,620
%uh I started as a chief Los 16 inch

222
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,320
exchange you using day binary

223
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,930
trial yes and if it is

224
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,660
last night is who %uh

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,689
Dubai is setting at

226
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,070
grant over solutions things those are
mostly limited

227
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,370
ICQ of at home as

228
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,540
and generate amassed sent you

229
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,560
the red ones other high-resolution so

230
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,300
day appliance all execution as

231
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,770
shape yes much loved one in the red

232
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,110
last loves up you can't forbid

233
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,540
who wanted a red one that just
competitive who once we each other the

234
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,199
reference to each other

235
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,380
what you see on the binary Butler is

236
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,170
is essentially the same area are using
this as a reference point

237
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,219
those are open she and games running on
Windows

238
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,300
best deal bitch and games running Linux

239
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,420
aunts then be that driver has a

240
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,349
but if it command string of on its own
which is in a very bad environment

241
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,940
variable

242
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,420
but the although it does not change that
much

243
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,680
it improved some games quite a bit and
it slow it down

244
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,380
other games quite a bit so in the end
that's just cancelled out

245
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,570
in the comparison and here I

246
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,240
man not to win those games that happen
open share %um there and it died 30

247
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,760
render

248
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,920
compared to each other the so is that
you get some idea

249
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,010
all day APIs compare don't read too much
into that that was just

250
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,610
under Tournament 2004 and

251
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,010
unit n combat activity and open shell

252
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,610
on Windows so

253
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,860
this century saw this then made a driver
has a

254
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,130
pretty I

255
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,990
that that the open challenge timid them
open shell

256
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,030
Drive II that would show part of the
drive into the city part of a trial run

257
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:59,430
pretty much at the same performance on
Windows

258
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,870
so be no throwing mind I S

259
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,170
that climates I

260
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,030
thousands games me bills peptide the
games running

261
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,430
by and on I

262
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,989
running fine and there is solved if you
use

263
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,220
they mind with alt is a any of those
mighty

264
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,410
ready %uh features to drive allied
itself

265
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,810
we'll see that's the performance is
about 60 percent

266
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,199
all what in this achieves it is

267
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,230
pretty much the exact same result they
got

268
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,350
last year dusted other 6

269
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,380
sixty percent this no 61 that she

270
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,360
fuel cycle slightly past it was 65

271
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,950
but levels Lee

272
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,610
claimed are it something went wrong with
you last time

273
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,300
so you see then be at the

274
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,000
any/all the Mikey threading

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,579
our capabilities of the drive all all I

276
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,879
that it CPU limit that's

277
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,049
run bill as:

278
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,650
personally the increased %uh for
mississippi you cite

279
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,179
but on a traffic stop there is not much
change which is

280
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,389
quite expected so it

281
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:27,579
it did day execution-style class is

282
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,309
you of bags estimating the game

283
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,149
feeding what message you more
efficiently

284
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,639
isn't going to whose performance much

285
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:41,789
that sends there's never he is a

286
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,269
separation between

287
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:48,759
a James you and Angie unit be

288
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,549
I CQ limited spotted range

289
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,799
limited data it still goes up %uh

290
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,399
slight and bucket she

291
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,580
that marketing is that I answer sixty
percent

292
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,240
and just was I'll eat I arledge

293
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,809
see you visit situations bitches alt

294
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,309
used to be or batch all

295
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,139
workforce use

296
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,529
and on the cheap you side their souls

297
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,659
upbeat worse than I expected but its
most to be

298
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,840
holes I don't those for an effective

299
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,519
race-specific that 100 Windows

300
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,580
and there is but it is the game this

301
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,649
something okay they don't shed forced
you to finish

302
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:42,678
every great and that the it lost effect
of

303
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,049
which means that have to tell ice cream
old

304
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,629
sister re: that seconds you don't like
it slowly

305
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,500
hospital uploaded yet

306
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,049
%uh there is sought is the same thing as
shit finish

307
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,250
forces to try to evade for or mass

308
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,899
excuse but been those is a bit more

309
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:08,399
to office well entry of girls that I

310
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,459
of because it just

311
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,009
I believe that is protest in a hurry
ends

312
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,419
desist exception bad day she tries to
access it

313
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,200
they sit down until it sees eviction
uses

314
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,330
data something does is just shit fetish

315
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,879
on their houses cheer great pixels

316
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:32,779
a chip get this image

317
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:36,110
%uh this cheers updates image a seven
ish

318
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:42,689
uploaded again which is else

319
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,139
and

320
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:50,860
well compares this is I test the

321
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,889
any the ever costs

322
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:58,918
thousands and up like so

323
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,139
and this this I get a bitch

324
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:05,279
yes and purchase

325
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,659
still source drive on this

326
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:12,840
it s SS thought it best

327
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,299
or this there's is this also

328
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,990
last year the used to get a
seventy-percent

329
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,070
doing this so it's d

330
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,939
Islands games session its I

331
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,019
so this

332
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:36,190
while the other ahead you have to scrap
going up I

333
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,529
Wallace was still icily on

334
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,289
I this a

335
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:48,158
other is the are AT&T cuts is that

336
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,639
yeah I hope that the implementation on
been knows is

337
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,370
not more efficient than they are

338
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,939
open shale implementation on bindles

339
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,039
and this différents may not look that
big but if you compare the Dow 30

340
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,379
performance

341
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:09,110
add to the open show performance and
then at in lines at this place though

342
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,449
this

343
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,639
that and you get it wrapped it looks at
all this

344
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,649
which is still improvement last year and
about 30 percent

345
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:21,729
up

346
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,200
on dateline now you know last night as
there are 40

347
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,049
and the fuel at the end a

348
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:35,168
the combat stream it's even a bit I up
but

349
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:41,360
a bad student video caught them pro find
is somewhat smaller

350
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,559
in part because it's still believed to
drive us most cheap you limit even that

351
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,070
small resolutions

352
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,870
but there is so

353
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,168
I any and Steris a still a lot of

354
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,350
me to go on rating cuts this year did
not test that binary

355
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,418
driver online

356
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,299
%uh on on Linux because I tried to do
that and it read

357
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,999
it rained every game at five frames per
second and I couldn't figure out what

358
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,679
went wrong in time

359
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,309
but the my yes lot better sucks last
year about that

360
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,999
that binary try about loss about 10 to
20 percent faster than the open-source

361
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:24,740
drive up

362
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,019
at bank then I can show that there isn't
much

363
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,639
much use height at least on that Scott

364
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:35,090
out there may be more useful out the
binary fglrx driver

365
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,408
on you look hot sadness compare appeal
which one

366
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:46,220
but I don't think there is much to worry
about about this old binary trial

367
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,549
and find yeah online b-day us this time

368
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,408
no one the main point but

369
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,230
test he said years a this hotspot

370
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,269
of the access them so I could test OSX

371
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,460
and the results are pretty much all over
the place

372
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,120
the cheap us if you limit that up close

373
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,889
for the of what is slow when she even

374
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:17,590
in just again to open shed against your
not 18 both

375
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,779
which loyalists met my expectations

376
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,700
but the at least in one game in
Jacksonville take make less pins to

377
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,179
hello defend those speeches fight a
cheap %um its crash what's up to 120

378
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,269
percent

379
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:37,269
up I have to do more investigation to
see that those differences come from

380
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,960
but I don't read too much into that but
it gives you a rough idea

381
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,049
about Hall always sex.com ps2 Linux and
Windows at least on

382
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,220
I in be a cheap deals but on the Linux
side

383
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,100
and windows open shared by suspenders
tactic eat a result is the same as

384
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,129
something you a card

385
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:04,490
answer thanks to the results lineup is
seamless

386
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,999
about 60 percent bit dateline

387
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:11,360
the one thing

388
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,699
that was noticeable a bus that on this
old sister

389
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,480
the improvement from a command string
boss and lots more than on you 1

390
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,399
and that's a protester girls

391
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:27,799
and if US air if you take days
confederate battle

392
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,990
open shed result ballistics and at

393
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,480
by its inefficiencies you end up weed
eater

394
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,929
appliances

395
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,119
so to sum things up day

396
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,019
well yes this festivities use

397
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,570
by polls 10 check it out home

398
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,710
the depositories yes

399
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,889
but the improvement of that artist its

400
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:00,248
that mean and is it fixes a.m. shot army

401
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,299
used

402
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,009
use in a situation that every game loss

403
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,369
slow its Sun some was this

404
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:15,100
where you read slow had I'll tell me

405
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,168
yes some games

406
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:21,909
like not because one image

407
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,249
I he when the I'll consider

408
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:29,259
ass those this and I can say god

409
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:33,029
us want us to attend percent

410
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:36,389
but the it's no longer the case that hi

411
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:42,399
this the office and windows

412
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,199
%uh dusters remaining products sold

413
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,740
biggest one is this divine us yes

414

always days of is eighties

417
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,740
bills just revised was use

418
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,879
was up said

419
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:12,309
which is okay if you have a distant
issue %uh

420
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,220
such of law for you a song that

421
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,279
from changes the use but of course

422
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,169
its is us parks got some feedback

423
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:27,639
that's things like runs

424
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,029
in parallel to his

425
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:34,669
is resulting stuttering songs

426
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,779
as see you and

427
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,220
30 percent is cue on was just spent

428
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,799
meeting you look a mess by or mess yes

429

the Sol

430
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,869
I tried a few attends to use

431
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:55,009
politicians see this ish actually whilst

432
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:58,899
distressed us

433
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:02,209
have headed at team to a

434
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,480
did assault yet because much

435
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,679
people's yes it is

436
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,610
well that is just immediately mine but
most

437
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,008
Alliance that or months about

438
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,399
s okay for each lot Wallace

439
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,428
be and

440
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:28,919
to as operations %uh not efficiently

441
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,350
yes also love it necessary

442
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,408
she updates at resource

443
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:38,940
updates so those R&D or I

444
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,460
his on s population

445
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,820
they don't hope is use of

446
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,210
shades washita assets and use

447
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,210
hiya you storage cool

448
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,360
%uh to have a lot of girls so

449
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,610
14 in is that he can issues cheer

450
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,090
arrange be positive ask stop

451
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,189
at artificial or of have to bother

452
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,580
and it also came out finish till

453
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,840
day British and messed it up

454
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,299
goes edge David or at us

455
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:20,369
there yet 28 anything ish other buddy

456
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,709
definitions out that or another its net

457
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,710
say pop is tools base

458
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,059
well shit so currently have to use

459
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,539
up system memory of danjus

460
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,789
ship us updated building speech

461
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,669
guys next

462
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,809
%uh handles the for dimensions

463
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,730
centralization programs are

464
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,830
one other issue especially us rising

465
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,220
synchronizing accessed is resources is

466
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,379
there are many approaches some games
this close

467
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,709
another Welsh and precious choosing the
wrong

468
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,950
few things and other the both of these

469
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,360
long as one as send ads

470
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,949
performance up yes

471
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,259
and there is a danger that he will all
team-highs such

472
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,549
us and again this is

473
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,789
uniforms there's right now me or

474
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:29,840
its I'm areas has been and

475
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,080
so if you gain weight myspace seconds

476
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,189
game red and seconds

477
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,809
added much I sit n face what yet

478
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:48,720
and but it's not hard lol so

479
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,720
this that's all hotels

480
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,769
closed as usual issue it

481
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:00,619
last something trees you

482
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:04,590
and a million drive us sometimes fuses X
issue

483
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,658
those shiite office of course his
basically

484
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:13,879
and do that in some cases it just so I'm
doing 28

485
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,689
was I up it up as a result is

even their own shit on the hugh is

495
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,190
still games and your settled

496
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,340
office shows don't caller

497
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,899
arrangement for it

498
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,998
and state law but up

499
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:06,289
drive system like it's important for my
US

500
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:09,429
a NBA precious

501
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:12,580
people is measures from will

502
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,869
fglrx this isn't just us

503
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,639
its ballots that's funny five minutes
and then you

504
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,639
is be you can use stage

505
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:28,699
and that be NBA States

506
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,850
by using a new text around show cause in

507
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,449
usual Eagles used office

508
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,529
these as be that use long bonds

509
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,980
threats doing using those

510
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,369
artists assaults you

511
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:49,389
a we have at Los to

512
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:52,580
met up to have office they

513
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,059
this another on it

514
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,408
harding breads

515
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:03,570
both games lost again

516
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,649
so still that the of things

517
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:11,809
the some Christian lungfish

518
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,580
shot use asked yeah both times

519
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,330
by the is I'll Hall

520
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,720
up Matt mess on BS

521
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,119
yes shit decision

522
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,600
yes is essentially the same

523
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,609
%uh depending on

524
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:37,070
what stepping ish us wise ass yeah

525
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,119
so all comments name intercepts

526
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,789
mass much do artist you

527
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:48,549
for NBS man serving two cysteines

528
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,639
generate ancient horse so any

529
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:55,689
on it day

530
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,679
if day which you try and use were I

531
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,759
what I that day she

532
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,489
I India's message as fast

533
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:10,129
hip-hop incursions the game watching

534
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:14,189
its wartime that she you try hours fast

535
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,980
defying is witty a time

536
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,340
I'll day chief you chose so depending on
what the game needs

537
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,678
won his first yeah

538
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,340
I all close loss horses

539
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,178
files and media stations just all

540
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,049
on yeah at various organizations

541
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,269
told us 52 his assisted

542
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:45,429
certain toys yet rush this will are

543
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:48,799
for phones and

544
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,210
some arguments within the engine is that
both she and that

545
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:57,019
the whole range essentially record its
function the stuff but optimizations

546
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,929
it a forces have a date for the threat

547
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:05,999
and their performances terrible for the
benchmarks that violated 90

548
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,500
exploit issue at that point and she used
to patch bitch

549
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,239
a replaced she had met but arrangement
that that alone but a copy and then ship

550
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,529
us update up

551
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,090
up but without that tech guy can be just
facebooked imitations

552
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,360
wouldn't do any court that's all I
T-thirty called

553
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,679
so that's pretty much the comparison
between two

554
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,230
similar solutions 0

555
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,540
love I love it all %uh edge its

556
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,060
laws compares now that happen to at

557
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,500
us games finance well

558
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,520
yes that business performance notes

559
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,560
what and lie

560
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,370
and Los Altos that up in those still yes

561
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,650
fish well but the

562
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,040
if you look at this rate basis sick
implement

563
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,430
defense a second its not mmm

564
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,890
it's a subtle Bethpage place

565
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,339
out system is funny s anyway

566
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,510
but on the other hand you know bench
sometimes

567
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:24,120
as that it's they're still there

568
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,089
it distills both missed the last day
thank you notes is

569
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,550
BTU's just

570
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,010
sold it to exceed mine the up

571
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,320
pretty much as fast yesterday

572
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,710
us loss I

573
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,840
with I'll day

574
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,880
asking yes as it is it's still

575
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,880
his but those %uh

576
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,300
1 that's most ambit

577
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,610
videos update so test

578
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,700
as find a topic like to bring up

579
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,149
any miss it us here is to copy all

580
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,760
through all that khomeini trawlers

581
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,820
a sec I driver

582
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,310
yeah really is simple benchmarks that
essentially

583
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,620
us that us one thing that every mention

584
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,950
Taurus not to at it or its roles

585
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,220
those cues 6 wells actions that

586
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,629
his else all 60 install horse

587
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,810
soul see store space you on face

588
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,490
and I be a a space is there a young

589
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,680
further a slight Fiesta formats

590
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,069
of it justification his ICE

591
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,680
Gilpin she a trial on minnows and you
can see that he's

592
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,980
me them windows

593
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,600
open shed has a significantly know what
role the head

594
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,330
then die bitch is mostly because thanks

595
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,080
us I checks to

596
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,180
babysit you'll be develop us

597
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,680
be activity edges stupid things you can
do

598
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,120
you don't know what you doing that will
ensure those which

599
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,990
the land yet the same tests as well

600
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,149
possess games was slow

601
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,660
about those it sample that flaw billion
implications

602
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,819
or at least what do you call it she you

603
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,160
if you many slow boss

604
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,270
yeah 600 she driver is I causes that bit
slow and even those

605
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,220
A's that cinches it's considerably
slower than they've been in this chair

606
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,240
driver it's even slow what that

607
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,520
50/50 drive and if you stopped off at
their high overheads to begin with but

608
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,030
then I'd

609
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,950
by its overhead on top of it you end up
with this

610
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,529
but and I

611
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,740
this you have to improve fly and a

612
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,839
this is not something don't read too
much into that

613
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,520
but it's something for private
developers to

614
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,930
just keep in mind bending at extra
things

615
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,690
to that she had it all %uh Troy race and

616
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,030
saw entro elements functions

617
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:29,420
I over the past two years and proof
destroy overhead benchmark in mind tool

618
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,020
essentially achieved upper the number of
troll course

619
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,490
and that improved real game spent about
five to ten percent

620
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,660
so this troll the head this day is about
this could eventually I guess

621
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,470
GLX yes but still

622
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,689
there is some value in keeping you wanna
chill excuse Cohen

623
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,760
in mind

624
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,880
so that's mostly it the next step this

625
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,430
next the salsa Miami

626
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,140
is she past us mine

627
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,190
updates and I through scheme

628
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,750
date to she ass use

629
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,450
this goes to get serious about

630
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,460
it ended at its mostly these

631
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,850
but I'll had yes

632
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,870
pews nasty p

633
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,650
law are is cheap use just

634
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,890
each is soldat you

635
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,270
you various missed it didn't really care

636
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:43,610
of now people see all this

637
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,460
patent in some games is worst I'll

638
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,480
wats shoes outside

639
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,630
out equals is used of

640
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,200
use following and %um estimates

641
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,390
slight past I did its

642
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,900
as I'll performance but it's now adult
by

643
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,080
got fights most aus said

644
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,549
is for well

645
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:17,580
and destiny days us tractor

646
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,779
funny decides to go on that someone's
anybody wants to

647
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,300
verify as results up those things

648
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,460
on a new alternator service art bench

649
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,590
up itself isn't real

650
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,860
a some his

651
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,680
some tired

652
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,750
people's use s I and hopefully

653
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,400
same exhaust furnace

654
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,850
us soul

655
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,529
thank you she's I there are any
questions

656
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:58,470
house yes

657
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,939
I

658
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,579
old like

659
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,490

suggested it's

668
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,070
necessary so I know there's
implementation of their

669
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,470
its some games quite a bit but the
interesting

670
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,549
s is if it improves games

671
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,910
by bypassing performance us is

672
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:02,910

679
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:25,930

680
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,879
