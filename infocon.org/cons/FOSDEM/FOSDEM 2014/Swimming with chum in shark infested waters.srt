8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,119
so personal me I

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,800
just myself my name is your own personal
I'm currently employed with Intel

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,660
Corporation

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,029
I read part the canal project since 1997

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,289
so been I start around six months before
after the project started

13
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,590
I I I started off doing

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,530
good I'm summers which is like project
summaries like what happened how many

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,730
II statistics about who did why

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,839
so for and that that merchant to

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,299
doing Agnone Journal Witcher which were
sorta

18
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,439
I well basically journal with articles
and

19
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,408
whatnot and finally I I'm now working
for the engagement team

20
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm also I a director I was elected
director

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,770
the gonna foundation which handles the
non-coding parts gonna

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,670
so I going forward

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,990
that's who I am so

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,210
a the first thing is really to define
what is outrage

25
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,070
and that is a concern us so I like to
define that first just so that we're on

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,949
the same page

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,130
so for me I outreach is really about

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,179
the ability to communicate the goal so
I've our project I

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,320
address problem trends and commit to and
communicate them

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,669
to to developers and so far I

31
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,590
and also really to be a positive proper
between users and

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,640
developers right so going people have
problems are things like that

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,690
you need somebody who has really good
interpersonal skills

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,569
I to communicate both and and do you

35
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,649
deal with things with it this is a with
some sensitivity

36
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,700
so

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,599
I really want to start off first with
some historical perspective

38
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,010
I am I do that because

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,280
I there are some lessons to be learned
when

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,060
when we when when we transition from you
know I'm wind

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060
wellpoint Act two you know 2.0x right

42
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,310
so wat when we start up you know

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,580
1.0 X it just started right new project
and

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,800
the average agent here you know
developer was

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,370
power in nineteen years old we had this
one developer I know who was

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,659
maybe 12 maybe even 10 so

47
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,980
when you think about it with these guys
know about suffered about

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,379
they were just starting out and

49
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:19,399
I there were doing to do so do something
interesting right

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,940
they want to write a desktop and at all
kinds of ideas

51
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,549
of classical stuff our and

52
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,319
every feature is awesome basically
showing up

53
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,859
right is testosterone and we're going to

54
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,980
show all the cool things that we can do
I

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,079
winter desktop we had occurred we can do
it

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,860
and of course that led to a lot of funny
features like

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,860
swallowed outsider know if anybody there
as well wraps

58
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,549
where okay air old one not allow this
comes from

59
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,120
over 10 managers like FTW and where you
can swallow

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,900
X clock and put it inside the doc it was

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,060
it was when the more ridiculous features
we had in

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,120
her so but you know what

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
other speeches came at a cost I am

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,620
that cost is

65
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,709
really incivility

66
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,019
when you have every feature you can

67
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,530
you are going to run into trouble and

68
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,380
you know I i've talked a lot of people
about that time frame

69
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,110
into why we do it would b day we went to
axe

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,430
and we were actually in trouble

71
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,080
because we we were so

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,409
undisciplined we

73
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,949
we incurred the wrath of distress they

74
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,949
I was so this that they want to drop us

75
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,690
because we're so unstable art platform

76
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,139
was a moving target because

77
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,960
we kept changing things you kept playing
around with Kerr

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,219
keep trying to do things so now we can
write for the platform

79
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,720
so thats was pretty broke

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,400
so when we transition to go in and 2.0

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,810
I it it was more than just a a
transition

82
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,810
from

83
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,820
was more a director's vision are just a

84
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,250
a version number right I this was really
about

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,949
transitioning prime basically some young
kids

86
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,460
to people who

87
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,330
who are learning how to actually do
suffer development

88
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,270
an really was about growing up

89
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,070
being mature and so we have to worry
about things like

90
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,280
a ps2 bility we have to wear our
listings

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,698
because if he didn't know we can trust
the platform

92
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,840
so although this is I'm trying to do

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,340
say all this I i'm going back to this
historical perspective

94
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,859
to kinda say can give you understand why

95
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,270
we are what we are and why we sometimes
very conservative were why we are so

96
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,789
of for about how we put

97
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,639
something into the flap

98
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,750
because the lessons learned I'm going on
one point X

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,639
towards because I was there was a hard
that was a hard transition

100
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,970
because we rebate every application
developer have to rewrite

101
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,530
air their I'm

102
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,369
one really good example was

103
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,520
there was a the financial app spinning
cash

104
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,500
day it took them in like five years

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,960
to actually highly

106
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,130
convert from I went for extra 2.0x
because I read so many

107
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,849
to divert their own widgets and it took
them forever

108
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,560
I so

109
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,860
be presented to Forex and

110
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,280
it was different than one point X

111
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,669
and you know what that means people a
change

112
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,859
and boy did

113
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,349
and because we took all those fun things
we took away swallowed aP's

114
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,919
our God so

115
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,669
I N it's really interesting people's
reactions

116
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,049
when when something like this occurs
because they really get

117
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,710
I am irate because

118
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,198
again it's it it was

119
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,650
IIIx explain it it was

120
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,289
just the really wanted to play around

121
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,430
with so many things right lots of things
you want to play around with

122
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,310
but women why did we actually want to
simplify things

123
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,210
we really decided on having

124
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,310
a kinda just works mentality

125
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,860
right we won't have sane defaults

126
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,410
we want to have our suffer were for
ninety-nine percent the people without

127
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,310
having to mess with

128
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,050
so air we actually have one other thing

129
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,549
we actually want to have our suffered to
be usable by

130
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,269
anybody regardless %uh physical
abilities so

131
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,399
I mean we started the the accessibility
toolkit just

132
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,919
because at that

133
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,019
so when when we went through we

134
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,230
am from gonna 2.0 to to dot 12

135
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,550
was was actually the best part

136
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,569
gonna project that was that was that

137
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,800
best because that was when we started
getting

138
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,410
that the the usual and tools right we
had

139
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,410
how the idea abstraction layer we were
able to finally

140
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,219
but a DVD a CD-rom into

141
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,370
computer and have it I directly mounted

142
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,160
Wow so

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,370
but we've all right we have %ah the
desktop

144
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,850
and what came as a final product was
something everybody really love

145
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,790
so it we can change things

146
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:42,790
and still come up with something really
good at the end

147
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,010
but buried a header entire time

148
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,660
we during the entire time

149
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,089
we at least who is it was funny because

150
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,300
we were removing things left right and
centre

151
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,969
when we did it we never you never

152
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,920
read everyday average so people really
complain bitterly work

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,540
I'm it's like common wisdom that

154
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,550
when new removes features like oh yeah
I'm

155
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,949
that's right because area rumors this
this part

156
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,630
this is the party remember that's word
address where the whole thing came from

157
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,100
was a spark but

158
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,380
I've reach we know we're way

159
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,130
22-23 and your hackers

160
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,700
you never did all those things P a
record people

161
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,070
whereby we do that rear into her cunt

162
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,850
so we never we never really did outreach

163
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,250
its was partly because I'm doing
outreach actually requires

164
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,779
some maturity right and

165
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:59,019
we didn't do that and because we didn't
do that

166
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,019
we had a lot of people in Layton how so

167
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,450
so very rude things

168
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,430
we didn't provide any contacts so why we
did it

169
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,880
we de nada explain why we were making
the changes

170
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,390
and most importantly we allow others to
write a story

171
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,390
that's where common wisdom comes about

172
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,740
because reading writers wheeler other
people

173
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,880
right every for why we say around in our
IRC channels and

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,459
look at they shook our heads and
whatever

175
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,939
we didn't have anything good there was a
Slashdot

176
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,279
rather something we didn't

177
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,240
we didn't do anything

178
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,420
so

179
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,019
we had we have so we let people write
right our story

180
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,690
and so those things became

181
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,490
became Chi I guess communism could be
done better

182
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,120
sure weaker I'm

183
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,089
but yet again this time before you get
done better

184
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,079
I don't think the we have that and

185
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,910
being so young and understand green

186
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,660
it's unheard of I'm it was free software

187
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,110
million reading really do I me I don't
know I remember any

188
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,670
any any project I'm doing eniac creature

189
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,229
do any kind that kinda formals

190
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,920
so reading gauger critics

191
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,469
then came country

192
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:53,470
now I'm I love others but I knew I was
going to come

193
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
Reese we saw this I saw the story before

194
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,719
and this great I am

195
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,620
lesser about my release we did

196
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,060
who is arguably our best choice we had

197
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,279
we were on we had we had for sures

198
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,010
we had videos ventured videos on YouTube
we have all kinds of cool stuff

199
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,880
I'm we really played we do we did a
really good job planes

200
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,329
so it was released

201
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:34,329
this reactions at some spectacular

202
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,510
hopes mists can miss the cat

203
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,600
cell the High Holy Mass those going on
three

204
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,620
there was Renesas quote there

205
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,089
I mean I think early as I always to get
this cat

206
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,880
really he really does kinda

207
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,939
encapsulated reaction I am

208
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,440
it was really funny because other via
had the largest comment thread

209
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,839
ever had at was tag

210
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,930
was it the with frumpy something

211
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,010
burpee editors reviewer gonna 3i think
it was

212
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,209
at it was it was it was hilarious

213
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,579
well it was hilarious and also sad same
time

214
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,719
but I'm

215
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,990
okay so I the head well

216
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,010
be completely change how we reacted I
mean you know to groom 3

217
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,170
in Iraq completely different how r how
we interact with it

218
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,459
so we changed changed how we interact
with the best

219
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,518
remade no bridge from the old to the new

220
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,760
and gazelle

221
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,050
all that hydrates a lot of people
decided well maybe

222
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,639
I have to learn something new mines
Walter look at somewhere else right

223
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,720
we had a private message

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,720
so

225
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:09,600
so

226
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,300
we had a problem prop

227
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,890
news travels

228
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,390
bad news opening is traveling

229
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,270
faster this is the day this is the age a
Twitter

230
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,730
Facebook Google+

231
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,880
and

232
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,880
but US apso the outreach is required for
damage control and communication because

233
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,310
if you didn't do damage control just
kill good

234
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,339
just get worse and judges have rule just
kept completely has negative

235
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,730
view the project so

236
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,560
again it comes back to this the calories
to rate this story

237
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,319
never allow any way to write your story

238
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
so

239
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,800
so it's really important

240
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,420
to engage use critics when we engage

241
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,500
communicate here in 10 our goals

242
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,880
and importantly our passion

243
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,520
when you change your critics they will
see ground to you it's happened many

244
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,100
times

245
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,200
I don't let anybody speak badly without

246
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,330
he's asking them why they feel that way

247
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:47,530
because when you do they will change
their mind well

248
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:54,020
don't do this

249
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,500
that's the worst thing you can do

250
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,970
we first started off that's exactly what
recanted

251
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,579
because when you get that much hate you
really want to stick your head

252
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,770
is natural re when we released 3 me
right now

253
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,800
arsenic I her it was our

254
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,899
it was our papers are piece place very

255
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,170
but we hitting me at a crowded there

256
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,040
I we had to cross there

257
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,300
and especially when you had all these

258
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,480
people like well hi

259
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,750
high-ranking people I mean it with and
UAB have reviews from

260
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,880
delegates action action show

261
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,420
as is nuts so

262
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,000
how did we how did we start that this
actually says

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,570
you know three for engagement pounding
sand within and

264
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,990
personally game I'm

265
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,720
the slow start really slow

266
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,240
I we had no apparatus changes community

267
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,030
I think how do you how do you start a
conversation

268
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,639
I know he was helping out pouring out
why we're doing it designs

269
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,450
what was the reason behind them I was
out there doing that I

270
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,460
very was

271
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,490
engaging people with misconceptions 0 to
mobile OS

272
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,820
0 this looks like it's something that's
great put on my phone

273
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,950
all wrong

274
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,120
I am

275
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,169
and and are rear and also

276
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,200
we weren't really showing proper
documentation

277
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,490
where can they go this find out
themselves so

278
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,870
so we need to pull together our
communication

279
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,229
jails so we didn't put a couple things

280
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,770
I we create a Facebook page we

281
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,010
I had a Twitter account I we had a
Google+

282
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,090
we create some communities on their we
had a again no

283
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,709
account as well and we to control the no
namespace on

284
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,970
free.net so

285
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,230
no where else could create good own
socks or something like that

286
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,290
right I'm

287
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,350
we monitored

288
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,889
the pound gonna hash tag nature

289
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,150
see what people are saying about us we
am

290
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,230
I person do this because son Marcus

291
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,430
I'm I use the search gonna

292
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,470
my Google+ St

293
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,110
frankness her I'm and and I would I
would actually start fights

294
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,090
medicare has her I like I said I wasn't
going to allow anybody

295
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,760
to rate this story right I wasn't gonna
do it and I i used to

296
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
go I read it there is no place I wasn't
I was

297
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,560
a release about things

298
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,929
we redesign our wiki featured people

299
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,740
than we we have blog post

300
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,390
Alan day with would would show up

301
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,520
nice blog posts about latest designs

302
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,550
things like my TS also

303
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,830
class and also that some stuff being C
on platinum

304
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,419
so we're going or information out there
we sometimes

305
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,960
still get the same thing

306
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,970
a was featured summers I hear it's a

307
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,520
reflexive vacancy rate from

308
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,100
from Nagpur to why white that why is
that so reflexive I can understand it

309
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,928
when you're

310
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,620
engagement is sorta interest there are
all kinds of people

311
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,620
who are upset

312
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,379
for a number of reasons I'm

313
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,840
I i happen to be on the plane

314
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,760
pack and

315
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,220
he was on the plane and 10 minutes after
he sits down

316
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,370
he started going up

317
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,209
on condemn he loves to do that and

318
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,790
there's a reason for that the reason is

319
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,010
is that going into is perfect for

320
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,770
was he really loved the window manager

321
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,400
it was fully compliant II

322
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,880
its back he loved and

323
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,510
when we transitioned to condemn shell

324
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,620
I he lost a something for him it was an
emotional response

325
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,290
because it was completely wanted and now

326
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,610
it's not and it almost felt like a
betrayal

327
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,689
because he was so involved in that
project

328
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,810
so and say to their hang out there
really involved

329
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,200
and that sudden loss

330
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,040
it's so emotional and

331
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,350
yeah he was actually tell this project
for you

332
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,428
time think about that

333
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:39,480
I was in a really good things to say

334
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,160
so when you engaging

335
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,240
it's really important to be sensitive

336
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,050
acknowledgement is actually the num
where the best things you can do

337
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,980
when someone complains is acknowledge

338
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,280
that I acknowledge the problem

339
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,940
i cant mcaleese 6

340
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,940
if uses Javascript Sox we've already
armour Rd

341
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,040
on that path we're not going to change
it

342
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,409
set so is about negotiation well if we

343
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,429
if we did this would that be okay

344
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,160
the change gropers I don't know you know
but

345
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,390
it's always continue to have

346
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,990
dialogue and it's actually bad

347
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,010
better when they're angry this iCare

348
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,030
if they met with nothing then

349
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,550
yeah when you go from there

350
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,399
so great you have to

351
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,000
so gay shit can be challenging

352
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,560
but it can be done and it does

353
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,320
does change minds I'm gonna miss
conquerors

354
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,740
we do things that under desktop stuff

355
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,200
we we push things we put pressure on the
coast

356
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,200
and that's a good thing because someone
has to do it

357
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,780
so I was saying geisha can be

358
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,850
can be good so he could have sent as a

359
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,300
I intense conversation can lead to peer

360
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,669
at so it's great but I i disabilities

361
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:34,670
where conversations like this could
turned to a park that possible so I

362
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,560
actually

363
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,290
but all that busy as it is up now

364
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,200
that may not be because engage in it
could be that

365
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
people have gotten used to it and

366
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,020
they're able to adapt so

367
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,389
fact we had two guys in I was talking
about the action

368
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,410
class action show guys they both love
that but they both love going on now

369
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,440
after that horrific review they had
earlier

370
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:13,000
I it was a surly contrast so is our job
done

371
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,030
job is never done

372
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,250
it's always a continual dialogue

373
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm so we're not done by a long shot
with that

374
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
keep monitoring we have two I'm

375
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,879
make sure that we have things like

376
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,220
transparency is removed them I'm
terminal

377
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,680
that we know how to engage

378
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,650
you know had and and it's not a
five-alarm fire

379
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,630
that we had to go so d6 have been

380
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,630
and you had to go and address it
actually all I have

381
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,520
so I can take some questions

382
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,520
crank

383
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,129
repeat the question idea and ask

384
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:17,130
last I'm hoping to know

385
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,590
for doesn't retire in Corsicana for
reactor

386
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,199
have hope a hopefully will be

387
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,030
a day I think we're done making

388
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:36,030
huge huge changes like that if you if
you can blame

389
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,908
became blame other people do you don't
blame me here

390
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:46,700
the other questions yes

391
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,700
well

392
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,370
its so we called we actually started up
calling ourselves the market and

393
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:15,270
we have really selling you anything

394
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,320
in this sense right marketing is really
about selling

395
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,678
that's why we change it engagement
because

396
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,309
I really engaging and trying

397
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:30,350
we're trying to engage in

398
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,539
and because we want to have a
conversation so

399
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:36,770
I'm not I'm market is really a one-way

400
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,490
thing right so I I don't

401
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,890
I don't II doesn't seem to you that

402
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:50,890
its marketing I'll

403
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,539
arm why I do that because

404
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,580
by asking questions don't because it's
really about

405
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,620
when so many I i mean when I i'm talking
some am really

406
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,168
its because they're you're saying
something there's something bad to say

407
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,270
something bad ago
