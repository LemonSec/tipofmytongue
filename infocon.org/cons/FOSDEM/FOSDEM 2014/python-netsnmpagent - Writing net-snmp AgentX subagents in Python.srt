1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:07,659
but the good when

2
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,849
stressed but ok cool and right

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,920
so well

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
post-colonial met as an MP is some

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,660
as probably everybody knows just the
dominant toolkits to independence

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,360
as an MP online on UNIX some

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,680
I was basically it's its application
Wilson AP work modifications mostly

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,370
and some libraries Tom discuss a mass
H&S on the PDF

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,269
six times a bowl you can love what money
also see which the

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm include fired a low DDL open system
call

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,140
and got some other extension mechanisms
as well as Marx agent texts in

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,820
particular

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,600
um space created Capt plum

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,250
it's got its temperature in a way to the
to see so you can now I'm

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,890
if you focus on C you can just certain
given a myth but it will you were just

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,560
call me to see on it and it worked on
the way to stem

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm a specific templates for you own a
gym so you don't have to 22 I get the

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
thing itself just fill in the missing
pieces

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,960
cetera but its see obviously and

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,669
what they cannot accept its use it only
spielt to stalk

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,479
so why I see I'm by experts told me so

22
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,479
playing some plants of um

23
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,679
could have been would be as well but so
can fight for I'm

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,880
let us not be it comes to the Python
what you that doesn't appear

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,189
doe um it's quite large

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,250
pile of of C code some that have swept
the whole capi

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,710
into to an object so I went to the coach

28
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,189
but its Klein coat only so if you want
to do an agent

29
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,229
your stock come to bisbee

30
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,789
the idea is some we just take the C API

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,410
and we excessive from tyson with see
types um

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,410
imitating Agent X operations with Nancy
about the first one took up the deal

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,730
there someone you love sauce what's
called buys an agent next summer

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,769
but it had some design issues and it
looks whether of it

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,810
to me um I did some pictures initially

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,160
but after seeing them not being

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,420
considered for pho for weeks or months I
just thought well

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,549
atop the whole shouldn't we got myself
so I understand it

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,410
which is of course an attitude
sandwiches so

40
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,579
well known among us developers just hurt
yourself

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,840
hello

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,870
by SunEdison P agent up it's pretty
simple actually it's just too sauce

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,519
hearts

44
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,519
someone some has all the c-type stuff
between slum

45
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,940
prototypes as we would say Missy

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,109
some which websites the API Colt just
thinking about it

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,110
and that no on top of it

48
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,599
this snow that doesn t a chance to PI
which is some

49
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,510
to fight with the classis word see about
that um

50
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,620
and is also not look like quite large
but

51
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,170
as extensively comment such which
explains why

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,359
the wheel Co sizes so one third less
among

53
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,930
got example lobbyists and agency
included

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,840
what I mean coding style I'm it's not
particularly Pepa to whatever the price

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
including style them

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,140
proposal is so small it's my own putting
side but is consistent

57
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,230
and it's been tested with gone both

58
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,369
5.4 15.7 versions of.net as an MP

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,909
for the simple reason that phone it was
targeted at Enterprise news distribution

60
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,450
sites they call themselves

61
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,609
sousa and Ubuntu

62
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,409
and they still shipping 5-on-4 so as to
take care of those as well

63
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,790
let's look at some

64
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,019
I'll be much simpler minutes and not in
my view some

65
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,370
this is basically the some a sanitation

66
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,819
how how you consortium obese just give
it a name

67
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,250
um just tell a data type in this case
it's not signed 32-bit some

68
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,070
scalability of um make successes said
was not so important right now we give a

69
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,900
description

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,340
and them given that we thought once
wherein the

71
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,448
7 p.m. a b-tree you what it and the
subject to appeal

72
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,949
so this simple to give us one translator
something like don't want a 3.6 it set

73
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:41,380
off

74
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,060
this is a quite simple example doesn't
into good value

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,440
which we want to to to make available um

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,660
you could have from can also do table
spot that's way more complex

77
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,590
but as a pot focus so if you have a
movie like this

78
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,690
this is no earlier decoration just
saying I'm

79
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,130
just merely constructing a treat for
information um

80
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,520
you don't have the coach yet and that's
of course the intent of using my advice

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,870
medicine PA gin Michael

82
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,400
so you got some goat and put import
statement

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,130
and Justin Paul the one fight with the
class let the API calls

84
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm home to construct a new objects

85
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,610
of types noticeably agent which nixon
agent name which doesn't appear

86
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,000
week rising totally among

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,250
and you give the list the firm if I S
and this case

88
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,300
the mid fight we just a minute defined

89
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,280
um that doesn't feel Christ that's some
home for example so it can translate

90
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,559
internally between

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,990
some symbolic names and the numeric 40s
with just seeing

92
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,910
so you quite an agent object cross into
public sex exception handling

93
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,440
I like you

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,509
next thing you do I'm just because if
some

95
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,590
take away its assist russia in the
movies 5

96
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,650
I'm doesn't mean that all those some

97
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,880
information elements are a pin appearing
medically

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,190
you still have to explicitly which serve
them which makes

99
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,620
sense because you could have two agents
implementing different parts of one and

100
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,449
maybe five

101
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,000
so you come up with a new exploration
normal of cups of a class factory

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,520
a meal for the different datatypes this
case into

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,789
32 I thought was it on-site white

104
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,120
got first whatever no

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,930
any given the the OA the weather center
to the should be with us but

106
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,100
go so inside you and let me treat

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,289
once you've done that shift which
asserts all you from

108
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,949
Sunapee objects I'm speaking of S&P
objects because you could just as well

109
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,590
it was just a table

110
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,099
the table is basically well some cells
of samples calaveras

111
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,560
I'm once you've done that you college in
sight

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,810
no that makes it actually connect to the
master agent at some pt

113
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,669
got to prop exception handling it ago

114
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,930
and then some yay jim is he looks like
this

115
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,610
the as a simple example of course it's
gotten an endless loop room

116
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,930
call agent check in process all the time
disinfects

117
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,729
and that doesn't feel I we call I'm they
designed it this way

118
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,008
and as I said I'm just whipping the API
calls

119
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,550
I'm so we have to do it this way as well
this example I could serve

120
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,680
for fun update the integer video just to
clear out and and double its value of

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,819
the type

122
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,919
provided able to finish initialize that

123
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,830
or give other its failure or whatever
and

124
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,389
I could call miss Anna P sets from the
command line

125
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,520
a and see the new value a few

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm this is very simple they of course
more complete example some

127
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,150
for some love tables on the sauce a
solution and we love H&S

128
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,669
of course also much more complex so they
cannot vote for internal use us like

129
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,520
when outright kilobytes three thousand
lines some because you want to do all

130
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,948
the fancy stuff like her

131
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,270
demonizing and and and look for looking
and whatever

132
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,750
white some if I have time I do is shop
Timonen

133
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,690
in a second just so you know that
something's missing of course

134
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,330
litigation trucks in particular so um

135
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,750
you can't as of now you can write an
agent which informs the mass agent

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,708
um for example of a fan fail anything
like that

137
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,729
API documentation who would have thought
that and

138
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,269
maybe some unit tests because as I said
after all we produce safety Dwight

139
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:56,910
so it would be of course nice to have
them the elementary is automobiles some

140
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,910
have safety as well going to get the
real shot quick demo

141
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,910
this the example Starex re of the the
sauce distributional

142
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,540
and got the simple agent here if you
look inside

143
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,740
this is all things some we just saw
basically

144
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,209
scalable use different some datatypes
and also

145
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,829
tables and doesn't the nice thing is

146
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,880
you just want a script it sets of
everything necessary to test the whole

147
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,649
thing like

148
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,970
um calling SNMP dei um

149
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,970
is isolated from the west the system so
I can actually wanted with for

150
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,790
system-wide is impeded instance

151
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,939
one even tests up the top with the
commodity if 21

152
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,380
and add-ons the condom use although some

153
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,040
tables and sire I can go at from
separate cell

154
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,819
just give the come out like like to take
this map fire from the Select we connect

155
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,240
to

156
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,420
the instance on this port because as I
said it's separate from system-wide at

157
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,160
some pt

158
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,029
and kiss me the values and they can do
things like him

159
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,189
I'm like can also access the

160
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,920
the tables so I have to wait

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,449
already that's just a thought

162
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,300
so in this example old some worth should
be 10 which just saw anything like that

163
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,510
a.m. I could play well with S&P such as
well

164
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,019
but because my time is up um questions

165
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:35,019
ha

166
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:41,260
so how much smaller as the I

167
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,740
to patients in terms of what's in terms
of

168
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,540
be much depth progress whatsoever how
much overhead some

169
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,209
that but I think limitation would be
compared to see the in what terms

170
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,869
meaning like like go one speed or

171
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,029
Paul

172
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,149
fast of I'm

173
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,890
grant I

174
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,490
soul

175
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:09,920
says

176
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,469
Browns just

177
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,920
was basically it's a it's a it's if
Webber

178
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,390
its is very close to C API so if you if
you have a delved into the

179
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,800
the details of the capi you'll recognize
so much of its

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,000
and then again this is a see-saw exist
for you have selected just

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,589
given date credit agent objects and but
just some be able sand and you're done

182
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,810
a mess as for the overtime benchmark its
them for a simple reason that

183
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,430
widening the same in CE the same agent I
to flight

184
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,510
um was no option so I I have no who

185
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,040
compare wasn't but some overwhelm

186
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,829
I haven't seen any performance issues so
far caused by police actually quite

187
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,350
festive

188
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,740
I'm are running out of time does the
next talk us to start so I'll

189
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,650
thank you Peter got to me after what I
any questions

190
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,010
on any questions on chasing our

191
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,279
I'm outside the room and the Next Door
star Justin a couple minutes

192
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,260
should
