1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,380
it thanks thanks for coming I but the

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,260
almost last talk on the Sun this thanks
for sticking around in a

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,410
and coming to out to listen to this I
you have a cloud now what

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,970
so on you know you through to start
working on crowds and really what I was

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,570
looking out

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,980
is how to get a a clone of Amazon ec2

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,500
some working on it but she got second to
commit their own cross I can remember

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,279
the the PMC so we you know we worry
about low-level details and actually how

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:31,670
you

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,710
create Outback how you manage storage
network and so on

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,840
very well I'm interest in personally is
to I get a clone of issue 2

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,250
okay because you know we've learned
everything from

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,850
Amazon and when we learn from Amazon we
have no clue how they are you

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,340
building the house okay they're probably
using then

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,559
I but you know we don't know much in
terms of storage in terms of network

16
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,209
we don't know how they're creating all
their services

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,270
so it's kinda black magic but what we
know is that

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,580
they have bunch of services so they have
storage services of course they have

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,979
issued to for compute

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,939
they have archive services and now
they're coming up with the

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:15,460
buncha Analytic Services of course
Elastic MapReduce that came

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,589
came out in 2009 iraqi missus now for a
stream processing

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,720
I redshift for a data warehouse so when
you look at this in terms of crowd

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,920
I mean it's nice that we all talking
about hypervisor choice and performance

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,400
and as the yen

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,229
and storage solution and Seth works on
this but that doesn't work with this

27
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,100
version A V Burton things like this

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,298
but you know when we look at Amazon
really

29
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,360
they're just spinning at new services
left to right

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,070
every every month every quarter we have
new services

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,740
and to me that's what you know it's
about gates about

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,350
building those services and then using
them whether it's for

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,829
application deployment or a petition

34
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,059
a the application development in terms
of joining for structure are actually

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,329
having application

36
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,630
putting it on their so

37
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,790
the the landscape you know we've seen it
today and yesterday the landscape in

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,940
terms of open source

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,530
I infrastructure as a service solution
it's really I

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,620
about back OpenStack open every Ruki

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,930
over Gannet see we've heard it out by
the guys from CNN for

42
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,110
I I don't think there was any talk by
eucalyptus when you get this was really

43
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,890
the first

44
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,069
software that came out there was trying
to out to emulate

45
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,649
Amazon and create a clone of a mother so
that that's fine but really you know

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,970
what we want to do is actually once
we've built those we actually want to

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,609
use that

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,709
the API that they're exposing and we
want to serve services and use those

49
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:46,379
services

50
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,700
okay so that's really where interest
interest up

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,099
so I'm not gonna talk about these really
you knowing details

52
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,459
but what I have is that have some
friends in the

53
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,640
in Switzerland they have this crowd
exists care and I play a lot with it

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,970
because it's in production

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,830
it uses call stack behind it and it is a

56
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,629
it's a fairly basic crowd in the sense
that just for youjust

57
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,489
in French it and create virtual machines
and it gives you virtual machines

58
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,860
kind of like Amazon which means that
it's a public AP and then you manage

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,640
security group in and keep ears

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,190
so a lot of things I'm actually going to
show you some some demos

61
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,140
anna & we gonna use that crowd because
its introduction

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,450
and my point being that even even though
we are building

63
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,140
all we're trying to figure out how to
build those crowds for within companies

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,268
private province on

65
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,549
there are some of those that are not use
it to their already in production up

66
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:39,799
there

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,930
up so plus tax originally it was just
about back and then I just modified idk

68
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,849
up stacks

69
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,280
I because he wouldn't be fair to our you
know just do I just do the call stack

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,370
but you'll see what I mean by this is
that if we look at all the components of

71
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:54,840
those

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,189
yes I of course they have you know

73
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:02,030
something to and a computer via
transition former hypervisors

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,370
I they have something kind of storage
whether it's image catalog

75
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,470
or data volume and then networking we've
heard about

76
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,439
as yen and and things like this so those
are the three main

77
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,079
a no components there then you have

78
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,728
image management so you know in in clout
that we actually don't

79
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,460
give it a name is just the image
management I

80
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,638
in OpenStack that would be a glance

81
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,830
I up identity management same in class
that we don't give it a name but in

82
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,770
OpenStack they would be Keystone

83
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,139
I to compute would be novak controller

84
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,280
but for our class that we don't have a
name I

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,659
but you see that you know in all those
project where you take Open debut

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,699
OpenStack cloud that you cannot find
those same

87
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,120
same thing and those 3d expose an API

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,900
I R on top over there they have a net
not see the PI and we'll talk more about

89
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,039
it

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,759
or they also have a an issue to an
Amazon bridge

91
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,280
and that's really what we gonna use to
build those additional services

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,289
I dashboard so intense the best word

93
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,070
you know for example is just an example
show you that all those

94
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,680
components basically a all the systems
have the same type of components and any

95
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,720
that's the dashboard for CloudStack I in
Chinese because I worked a lot on the

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,220
localization

97
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,229
I should look at OpenStack you know
there is another dashboard

98
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,400
called or rise on and of course if you
look at

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,219
open a beer that they also have a
dashboard it's called Sunstone

100
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,060
sandstone thing you're that comes with
it so

101
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,250
you gonna find the the same things in
all those yes solution

102
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,910
terms a API that's really that's really
the key and to me that's that's where

103
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,900
the crowd is about you know it's much
more than just a revision is really

104
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,039
exposing

105
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,280
all the campus capabilities of both the

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,729
system through a easy to use API took
last act has a very extensive ATI every

107
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,068
from society exposed to that API

108
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,949
it's not a pure rest API I mean it's
HTTP Jason Bay's more than this to rest

109
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,120
and just that stupid Jason

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,280
I so it's more of a query API up

111
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,909
OpenStack is a as far as I know really
fully

112
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,509
REST API in the sense that you know you
have very well-defined you are I

113
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,030
and then you can use different types of
methods get post

114
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,169
put did it to actually manage those
resources

115
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,448
in CloudStack everything's going to be a
GET or POST

116
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,560
to so they have

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,199
they have a PS so that's fine so you
build a crowd

118
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,560
they expose an API you happy you can
start playing with this

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,910
okay so now how do you do this well

120
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,150
for you go to get her and I and you look
for clients

121
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,159
so you need a client to talk to that API
to that crowd

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,530
I left side is OpenStack

123
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,599
you do OpenStack clients you get seventy
two repositories in guitar

124
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,830
and then clout back to you you do class
that plan to get 22

125
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,099
and then where they're your pipe oMG I
Aruba guy

126
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,690
Java JavaScript you pick the one you up
okay

127
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,690
it on the up for them to see guys coming
in and then pressing you for

128
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,859
so you know Python lots of Python in the
in OpenStack of course it or it and I

129
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,080
impact on we will also have by palm
plants in a

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,909
in cart stacked sorry what's interesting
there is that whatever language you're

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,990
using whatever

132
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,690
at you're trying to do you going to find
a client for that cloud on get home

133
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,770
the state of that clients you know we
can debate but

134
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,560
they something happening there up so
let's look at a few clients

135
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,330
I the next one is specific to crop
factor then and I talk about a few one

136
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,650
within the Apache Software Foundation's
that actually

137
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,198
come into our to all of the yes solution
but also other

138
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,860
cloud providers that that don't provide
software but that provide their cloud

139
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,009
services

140
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,419
up club monkey specific I add to cart
stacked that's really RCI

141
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,060
so ec2 has a amnesty to see I of course
that

142
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,729
you know your info on your machine and
that's how you manage ec2

143
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,280
I so clever monkey that's for us that
for class that you run

144
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,369
a monkey and then you have access to all
the API about back

145
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,520
and that's how you you do very low level
operations in

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,799
in your problem now I'll show you some
things

147
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,699
says he has Peyton spoke about monkey if
you wanna you wanna get

148
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
up now you know of course I work on the

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,110
and effort you suffer from vision so I
like all the projects that I'm seeing at

150
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,850
the SF

151
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,310
there are tons of them you know 150
project that the SF

152
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,630
I lipped out is very interesting and I
work on the power because it's in Python

153
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,570
and I do pipe on so

154
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,420
even though our con call stack which
Java you know I could morning

155
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,849
in leap out I what you see with the
crowd is that it's actually a record set

156
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,470
by phone

157
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,910
wrapper on top of all the API not only
clout fact OpenStack but also uses

158
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,189
software

159
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,230
ago agreed DreamHost Amazon Google
compute engine and so on

160
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,760
so that means that if you're using
multiple clouds

161
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,200
I you take need crowd and then you can
write an application

162
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,130
and basically the differences in the
PI's are going to be totally abstracted

163
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,410
and you're going to be able to use that
that more you

164
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,529
so now you're you're starting to see
that look at those crowds are exposing

165
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,760
API's now we have rockers

166
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,620
are and of course I love your thinking
standards but

167
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,160
we'll talk about that up so typically
prop script

168
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,230
I looks like this missus Python you
import the modules

169
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,709
and then you get a driver for that go
out so you see exhaust kayla just

170
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,140
instantiate

171
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,430
the exoskeleton driver especially find
my keys and then I have access to a list

172
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,609
of commands that

173
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,959
IOC comment that are that the basically
I have leapt out so list image is this

174
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,869
sizes

175
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,660
those are very basic functionality every
crowd no

176
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,250
is the is the zones is the templates
least yeah up

177
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,760
instance types starring no things like
this

178
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,310
and at the bottom you see here there's a
deeply node method

179
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,959
where you can actually start an instant
and then past scripts and executables

180
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,040
scripts

181
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,130
a under on the deployment for typical

182
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,279
clout are set up

183
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,060
and this is even though I did it go
scale which is my

184
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,859
my clothes like route if you remove that
the driver line

185
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,890
okay all the rest is going to be valid
for any clout

186
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,040
OpenStack open it up ec2

187
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,219
there's nothing specific about about
stick

188
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,829
well almost

189
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:59,040
I J crowded another one that who uses
check out

190
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,020
yeah okay one person okay

191
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,620
rate night so heavily used J crowded
heavily used it's another project at the

192
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,020
SF it's a top-level project right there
they

193
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,270
they graduated so it's a top-level
project a

194
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,310
it was donated recently to the SF it's
all Java

195
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,130
and basically it's just like any proud
which the job us who did your job

196
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,210
library that can talk to any of those
crowds and abstract the differences in

197
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,910
in EPS Cape and it's used in lots of
tools that

198
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,500
that you may use and without knowing the
really that they reject house for

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,620
example if you guys ever heard of cloudy
fight

200
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,510
from US bases choosing Jakobs

201
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,770
Delta crowd is another one that Ruby

202
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,600
at in ruby and it's also at the SF so
here you see that

203
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,700
you know the the club doesn't matter

204
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,990
because you have rockers and then the
language doesn't even matter because you

205
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,830
can I find a quiet in here just said yes
if you have three project to do the same

206
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,300
thing

207
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,660
and that are in the language of your
choice so death occurred in Ruby

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,800
I Libyan unfortunate it was kinda
sponsored by Red at org

209
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,180
started by red at and then the dropped
it a little bit it seems

210
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,819
I bet it's the same thing it gives you a
rapper on top of our

211
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,510
although the differences so now that's
great but

212
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,270
you have all those interfaces and
nothing is standard so there's no

213
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,130
standardization on the API

214
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,430
and then you know there is no I all
those in

215
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,430
rappers are are different so we are
seeing some standardization effort here

216
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,180
I from gym yes we have to see me
standard that's coming up which is

217
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,530
an attempt at standardizing all those
APIs for the about

218
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,589
an office he eyes another one I

219
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,750
from open grid for a or GF right away
you see the problem

220
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,130
okay we're talking standard and I'm
ready giving you too so that staff

221
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,930
problematic

222
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,150
into me really understand there is
Amazon that's the defacto standard

223
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,079
and up you know it's not

224
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,930
they're not pushing it they're not
pushing for it to be standardized but

225
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,449
since you know it's so heavily use
that's really the the defacto standard

226
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,840
is gonna be interesting to see what's
going to happen with the Google

227
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,230
compute engine that just too was a was
made the

228
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,270
GA up which is yet again a different API

229
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,150
and we'll see if that that game from
steam and and

230
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,270
and becomes more of a standard now open
it up for example he's pushing really

231
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,189
hard to have

232
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,770
use it to compatibility of course you
can keep this

233
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,160
was a from the start an issue to clone
so everything they do

234
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,500
is issue to compliance with Amazon
actually if you could get have been you

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,280
look for

236
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,800
eucalyptus client you find one okay

237
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,089
which is Yuka I but in a in crop that
what we're doing i mean we can recognize

238
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,330
that the issue 2 is very important so

239
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,650
we have an issue to bridge and we're
developing a new one

240
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,500
I have to get better and then we also
have a Google Inc compute engine bridge

241
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,580
which means that

242
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,360
you can use the Google compute engine
clients to talk to

243
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,830
cross sec- okay

244
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,110
so we got that crowd whatever solution
you're using

245
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,340
expert in API and then you choose your
upper okay okay that's fine

246
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,750
but now we need to do things on top of
this up

247
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,250
so of course 1 I've the

248
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,170
I manager said you're going up stack I
don't really like it but

249
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,270
anyway that's what's happening so on to
public clients you know you're building

250
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,430
up the services

251
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,209
a cat and that's really what we're
trying to say we're going towards

252
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,590
Platform as a Service

253
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,680
and I'm I took a clue again from I
Amazon Web Services

254
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,229
up because a new but the club formation
service

255
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,340
and then also knew about

256
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,510
ups works but I don't really understand
the difference so if you go to their

257
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,630
page they have a application management
page there are

258
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,810
nice FAQ and their this picture where
basically it starts from

259
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,420
low-level services is set to start an
instance

260
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,290
create a firewall create a key pair
things like this

261
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,280
you know studying stands very basic
image management

262
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,800
I not have control

263
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,219
and then you go towards building
templates orchestrating

264
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,570
orchestrating multiple instances now so
you're defining the

265
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,780
software running in those machines your
defining the number

266
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,260
machines running how they interact and
then you go even further

267
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,200
until you reach Beanstalk which is
really now for you

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,310
app developer who is going to do take
that at

269
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,650
and just stick it through an API and

270
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:45,090
Amazon is going to do the to do the
magic so somehow we have to find a way

271
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,480
to go from yes it API

272
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,850
clients and then move all the way
through the weekend

273
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,640
we can offer was very nice pass services

274
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,319
so we have tools that going that
direction I something like

275
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,330
Apache were to live in dated right now
but it's a

276
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,100
sitting in tonight but she of course
it's based on Jake wells and what

277
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,480
happens there is that you write that the
finish enough

278
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,090
that the VM said you want started the
software you want on them

279
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,730
it can use basic bash script for a
configuration or it can use the

280
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,330
conservation management tool

281
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,370
and then you start that that cluster of
instances

282
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,090
and it's going to be provisioned that me
that let's say you want to build a Mongo

283
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,600
DB Questor

284
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,020
or inelastic search Questor to define
this in a in your file

285
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,800
your check web template she did too
tonight we're

286
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,010
and is going to our going to start

287
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,660
so that's great up but what we're seeing
also

288
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,020
now is from the guys in our
configuration management

289
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,230
I I think we're seeing very very
interesting things in the conservation

290
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,210
management room was full

291
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,680
yesterday I so that's just an example we
chef

292
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,920
but again you could use you can do
similar things but

293
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,349
and

294
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,240
and szostak can and civil pro in I

295
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,660
time here over there and developing on
my laptop I have a chef client

296
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,420
and I define my recipes for the software
that I want installed in those

297
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,560
virtual machines and now it's gonna
happen is that from my laptop I can

298
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,700
actually use the the knife tool

299
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,970
from from upskirt to actually do
directly deploying minority in the crowd

300
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,550
and it's going to install the the
software that I i that I define

301
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,480
so I show you I'll show you our an
example of this

302
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,030
I think that's that's very very powerful
because now you're bridging

303
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,980
your bridging the gap between
configuration management and actually

304
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,680
using the crowd so you're on your laptop

305
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,340
you have all those recipes you push and
so then you have

306
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,770
you know 10 instances with whatever you
want you know elastic search

307
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,820
how do whatever up and the crowd almost
becomes

308
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,439
transparent the next one

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,310
this is great but lately I've been I've
been playing with vagrant

310
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,520
I vagrant up but come and big run is a
tool to our

311
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,580
basically create virtual machines and
initially to create a machine on your

312
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,340
laptop

313
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,830
so that you can I use contribution
management whatever you decide

314
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,620
you know so back again chef but but
simple batch scripts

315
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,459
and you can we can define the software
you want in those machines

316
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,040
you know they can file and that's going
to create the instance

317
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,100
now what's interesting is that bigger is
coming up with

318
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,020
plugins for all those about so now

319
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,020
you're developing and at the same time
directly from vagrant you can't push

320
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,860
those instances in the crowd and build
those infrastructure up

321
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:54,300
you guys wanna take a break and see a
demo I feel like I'm losing you so

322
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,690
is the demo okay what you wanna see

323
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,370
okay let's

324
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,090
and cheating because I I know when

325
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,230
threads to cloud monkey for example

326
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,740
I'll to first let me show you

327
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,420
exhaust scale okay so I have my cloud
that safe the scale

328
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:23,420
it's very via I get network it's got
stuck behind it it doesn't look like

329
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,020
last night because they redid the entire
UI

330
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,450
but as very basic functionality and it
works great

331
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,140
so you can start instances define
security groups create key pairs

332
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,140
things like this

333
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:50,970
there's no guy view the demo if I can I
get on the network

334
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,480
a go

335
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,460
to have one instance running as I said
you can define security group

336
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,630
within security group you can define
ingress

337
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,820
egress rules okay so clunky here

338
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,870
is connected to our it's configured to
use

339
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,620
up to use this exoskeleton well so now I
can type

340
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,899
for example attacked list

341
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,390
stepdad and it listed all the list type

342
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,059
API's in prospect so all those are API's
there are available that I can use to

343
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,850
climb monkey so these volumes needs VPC

344
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,149
I what can we do

345
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,980
yeah of course

346
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,370
these virtual machines okay

347
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,530
it looks a little bit like garbage but
you can filter

348
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,990
you can filter that I'll ID name

349
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,230
so you get nice out

350
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,630
for you have a very nice here like your
cloud and now you can you can start

351
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,670
messing with things

352
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:08,670
with the up lipped out

353
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,730
okay so the if you know Python here I'm
just entering a and I

354
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,510
by on interactive shell and basically I
have

355
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,280
up I initialized it with some connection
object so I have a

356
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,210
connection which is Nexus cab driver and

357
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,400
it has bench have met the create keep
their

358
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,830
create node you name it so if you do for
example con

359
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,860
I list nodes are you see the same

360
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,600
the same node you got economist

361
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,939
a images

362
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,590
okay you see all the images available
and so on

363
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,040
so now you can script and do interesting

364
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,040
in interesting things op let's now

365
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,289
let's try to launch a Hadoop cluster are

366
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,320
so I mention this tool from

367
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,149
SF were but she were so accuses Jack
routes

368
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,480
to talk to the crowd up

369
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,130
and we gonna give it to a configuration
file

370
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,150
was just announced cluster and you give
a contribution file that just as new

371
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,720
stuff

372
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,929
security group you want to keep their
you want

373
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,549
I the software you want installed
version so here I am saying I want

374
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:53,549
worked out there a Hadoop distribution
things like this

375
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,370
okay so it looks like it's starting well

376
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,790
so it's gonna start 10 notes I i'm gonna
have one name node Hadoop

377
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,110
name known and then jump trackers so
busy creates

378
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,800
using that clients starting the the
instances and then is going to SSH into

379
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,149
it

380
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,250
run the a bash script by 12

381
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,910
very basic version the running backs
crude to install Hadoop

382
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,490
and had and then at the end to return
and give me a

383
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,080
SSH sequence to get

384
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,050
on their see say look at the up if a
look back at my desk for here

385
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,919
looks like it's starting I so I got all
my I don't know that a

386
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,550
starting went to 12 for once they're
running all green

387
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,210
than said she's going to connect and and
start considering

388
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,110
X the 10 I like a lot

389
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,669
chef source yes

390
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:01,670
server list

391
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,130
when I started working with
virtualization I you know all the

392
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,539
all the users said all I wanna hear my
wanna him

393
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,070
why because I want to be rude back okay
so here's a virtual machine your route

394
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,330
and then after a couple months there are
like oh no I don't want to be rude I

395
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,449
don't wanna managing

396
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,529
the software give it back

397
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:31,080
so now you know people are back again
I'm using configuration management and

398
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,178
not going to be rude

399
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,480
that's interesting so US a knife you
know you can do the same thing was nice

400
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,580
I up is it template lists

401
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,370
so all those tools give you the same
capability whether it's the club chick

402
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,000
route

403
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,380
knife you know you can you can miss
things list all the templates

404
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,559
a available I here when we gonna do

405
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,450
just for the heck of it a is this so
that some black magic

406
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,289
can you can you read that so knife

407
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:05,879
server creates I want to create an
instance I

408
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,919
small instance type I wanna use

409
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,130
went to as a template I

410
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,440
when and when that starts I'm going to
ssh as route

411
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,169
using this key when you start the
instance you stick

412
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:26,010
this keep their which is pre-configured
you use this security group

413
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,299
rustic search I no public AP

414
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,120
thats just saying just telling knife to
are not allocate an IP address and try

415
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,928
to configure NAT and things like this

416
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,390
and then here that's the conjugation
magic

417
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,039
where I'd II tell chef to to try to
install the elastic search

418
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,000
had a role and then I give you the

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,539
name

420
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,690
for them let's try to stop that

421
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,059
so that role what's what's in that role
is basically a list of recipes that I

422
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,580
want chef to our to go through to
configure the software

423
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,949
and I pre created this that's actually
the elastic search recipes coming

424
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,799
directly from their get her repo

425
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,668
so hopefully if things go well thats
thousand sense that's going to ssh

426
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,909
to that in stance I installed a chef
client

427
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,049
then go through the recipe and then if
everything goes well

428
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,960
I will have working and I stick search I

429
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,030
with an engine's and genetics proxy
running

430
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,460
in five minutes so we bet

431
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,549
okay so during that time

432
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,139
II Duke westerners bootstrapping all the
instance are running

433
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,559
I see my first then machine I started in
a different

434
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,590
security group ethic search

435
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,730
how is

436
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,200
a eyes jake has running here

437
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,990
subject about his bootstrapping setting
up a letter for

438
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,960
I'll rule for the a on the firewall

439
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,409
so we lead that

440
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,620
will let that go and the and then

441
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,620
I'll get back to it no so I was talking
about

442
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,250
you know they grant and vagrants for
their workers but I can see the

443
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,480
production guys actually starting to use

444
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,840
vagrant because you have configuration
management in there that you can share

445
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,720
and then you have plugins to deploy in
the in the clout

446
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,020
so that so they can file and you see
again you specify your

447
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,450
your box you specify the host the keys
and then what's going to happen is that

448
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,830
is going to push that mission

449
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,539
so those are kinda still low level

450
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,250
you know low-level tools that you can
that you can use but definitely when we

451
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,960
have is the

452
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,559
all the pass out out there club 100
definitely

453
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,210
the the big leader a

454
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,240
a in as a scaler

455
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,630
slipstream which are less known and then
codify

456
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,060
she's gaining quite a bit of of traction
and all those work with cross

457
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,669
back or OpenStack I I don't know if they
work with who

458
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,230
the open it up probably so there was a
SunPass

459
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:30,750
now you know going back to DC to and we
have that ec2 service we're trying to go

460
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:36,050
you know to the left I how bout clot
formation can you do crop formation with

461
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,649
any of those infrastructure as a service
solution think of that we now have

462
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,790
back Titian I it's on get happy to Rails
application

463
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,960
I that so you can actually use the back
and a few

464
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,260
sure low level and you want to just push
are cut from Mission template you can

465
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,900
use the back and part of this which is
called stagnant but otherwise yes

466
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,800
tacticians with give you our

467
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,350
Weprin and where you can and tear your
confirmation templates and then the

468
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,100
they start up of course OpenStack as

469
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,330
heat which has ir and I couldn't find a
good

470
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,919
picture heat so that's the 1i found on
on Google

471
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,980
as I understand it I OpenStack

472
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,790
heat can also consume I club from
Mission templates

473
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,790
anne's also does a to scaling okay

474
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,550
so we're starting to see those higher
level services in

475
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:33,639
in any of those solutions up to let's go
back

476
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,220
and see if we made any headway yea

477
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,320
so this is where so if everything goes
well

478
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,669
and way too

479
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,020
SSH this guy which is the Hadoop name
node

480
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,020
okay and now I should have

481
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:58,020
a dupe running

482
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,720
for pre the okay I i'm not gonna run a
MapReduce jobs I'll bet I want you to

483
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,010
trust me they work

484
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,910
okay I for you can go and actually put
data a

485
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,300
BFS commands and then actually run my
produce its own

486
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,750
right now I don't know I messed up
something with the security group

487
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,750
C-section that guy work but I'm

488
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,720
it does it does work get so I can you
trust me on that

489
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,180
so that's fine so in like where was that

490
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,220
10 minutes I provisioned Hadoop cluster

491
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,060
in a crowd I think that's that's pretty
cool why am I trying to do this because

492
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,090
I want to expose

493
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,409
map and my producer API their I would
like us to be able to provide an elastic

494
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,150
MapReduce

495
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,170
service I on top of any CloudStack

496
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,050
clout so that's the that's the basis
that you need to start with you need to

497
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,030
be able to start

498
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,379
Hadoop cluster on the man and then you
know

499
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,630
expose yarn or whatever

500
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,610
API their I what's the other one

501
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,320
so chef is still going I

502
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,629
shit still going

503
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,630
yes chef is still going

504
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,530
so to wait for chef

505
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,040
when we gonna try to do is when I try to
start another note in

506
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,470
in a in the pickup going to do this
harms them

507
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,760
is borinq I a

508
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,280
so that would be con- connection you
know

509
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,420
deploy node a deploying owed

510
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,120
you give a name to your instance was
them one

511
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,179
you specify any image you specify size

512
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,720
okay and then you specify a key name

513
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,190
that's the key pair I'll the scale

514
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,690
and then you specify

515
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,130
SSH key where is the private key for
that keep their

516
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:10,130
that you're going to use I'll

517
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,909
and then you specify a deep Roy scripts
the poor

518
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,070
cool I'm is d so that's the type of
command I mean it's in

519
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,510
that's much lower level than much lower
level than where

520
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,900
or or the the knife comment

521
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,660
okay so knife is finished so if we go
through everything I mean you know it

522
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,810
bootstrap

523
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,159
install chef and then went through the
recipes

524
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,170
and then started edge in X

525
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,510
because if I exposed a stick search
cluster

526
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,370
I that's that's not good so where is
that

527
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,620
ways that node so it's

528
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,209
a

529
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,490
for them suffers them

530
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,640
AP that's the AP

531
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,510
and you can do curls

532
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,750
for the stick search or chrome is a nice
a

533
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,850
extension which is a school sense

534
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,750
so you just specify the IP if that no

535
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,890
8080 because that's my engine export

536
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,890
I setup up

537
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,710
I said a basic authentication but I
enter the login and password before

538
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:52,710
15 him it's now running

539
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:02,159
well almost perfect IMO its go back to
this guy

540
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,720
KY St search an engine exe running

541
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,719
so doesn't like something

542
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,909
okay that was working how about our note
here

543
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,560
okay cool so the deep lawyers finished
here now what's interesting with the

544
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,600
with the cloud is that the up when you
deploy

545
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,770
with this that's just basically a list
of scripts

546
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,880
and now I should have

547
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,890
I the standout

548
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,170
okay I

549
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,370
when I did you find this it's a list of
script 10

550
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,100
one of the script is called script and
then when it finishes you can get

551
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,029
standard out

552
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,260
from it and when I was running was being
date

553
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,750
okay that's the a hello world grid
computing

554
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,200
so that works we deploy to know that and
I

555
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,609
and run ran some scripts on it okay so
now

556
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:34,530
let's finish with my

557
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:40,850
dupe were destroyed cluster

558
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:47,440
config small there's just destroy
everything its on demand so

559
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,870
being and when we should see

560
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:58,870
over here is we should see all the
instances

561
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,880
stop

562
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:15,979
mmm

563
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,000
that's not the part I was expecting to
have problems up

564
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,500
the network is livid

565
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,070
the okay so the network

566
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,430
you know probably in problem with the
network okay but thats

567
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,569
that's basically it I I think you get
the idea that

568
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,830
you know we're trying to be a bus hire
services there is a choice

569
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,200
a fact clients and then tools on top of
that

570
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,350
and whether your Python Ruby Java guy
you can find your ideal client for

571
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,470
whatever solution cross tackles one sack

572
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,100
open ended up and then we're trying to
expose

573
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,170
in Ohio legal services that clone

574
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,110
Amazon and we already have Cup formation
I

575
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,560
so I thinking we can expect more like St
MapReduce

576
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,670
be in stock and I can you name it sure I
get involved up a check out back

577
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,640
look it up and that's it thank you
