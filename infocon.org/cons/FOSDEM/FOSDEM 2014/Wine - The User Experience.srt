7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,200
slide hallway is have cue

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,290
have you this air

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,850
Chinese

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,059
low s okay so

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,059
user experience last year

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,280
flurry

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,280
and I every

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,420
this year

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,549
split

16
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,230
Ste

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,400
cell actually scraped

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,400
the floor last year

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,530
see but they were 816

20
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,740
threats

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,740
Ste

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,610
well any this experiment

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,900
scientific stance

24
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,520
part so information review

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,210
experience very messy

26
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,870
for me cell

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,120
first thing keeping first-hand look at

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,459
hard

29
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,240
through with

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,670
overlap here who won

31
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,458
last night you know last year

32
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,600
so I'll or you doing great yes but
three-quarters

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,000
posters specific

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
usually

35
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,340
most house cell

36
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,340
also is questions artists or

37
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,040
and then there's small other

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
reese's

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,240
of suggestions

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,140
which T users are

41
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,140
admittedly of suggest

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,490
race might

43
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,870
the developers

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,890
course users

45
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,980
don't have a clue how it

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,239
so you know I will give you 50 bucks to

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,630
write this patch their money

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,540
I'll

49
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,540
race now

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,919
tests tell

51
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,380
you okay those so

52
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,780
I'll are for users yes learners

53
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,369
lives users

54
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,410
only

55
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,440
yes it and there'd

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,960
0 yes was a

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,280
users portion under

58
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,299
recent there

59
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,350
yes or

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,810
sticky saying we don't support

61
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,820
the state's telling them

62
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,090
so I suspect there

63
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,619
California up there certainly personally
but they're not going to come there

64
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,020
lol

65
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:32,020
up to the extent

66
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,460
I many

67
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,419
it but forcefully yes

68
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:47,750
old this list

69
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,750
separately enough okay in way

70
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,330
other and a breakdown were

71
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,680
other other is yeah

72
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,040
does cured p

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,260
Stenhouse up so this

74
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,120
he

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,460
by this yes

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,880
through strippers

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,240
speculate

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,130
like I think

79
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,110
his

80
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,990
release

81
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,770
in Jan and other still

82
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,770
people this all

83
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,120
us well cs4

84
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,890

just finished stalin and they're not
even quite sure how to use their

86
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,930
said i think thats

87
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:23,310
resupply you see so many can I don't
think they're necessarily

88
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,730
that terms

89
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,690
we're hearing to look it

90
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,190
