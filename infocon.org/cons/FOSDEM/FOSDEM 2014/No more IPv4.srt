1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,080
his ear to tell us why we should say no
more EP 4

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
thank you very now thank you

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,580
I and thank you as well for this on

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,040
first open ipv6 thanks to him

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,220
meaty bone people including Andrew
Peterson and urs force them network has

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,919
been at the basics for many many years

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,710
Matt networking pon to moving on the
ipv6

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,090
and I'm from Cisco rice with its easy
kind of

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,170
the more complex pot is the application

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,020
is the operation so we this talk I
really would like

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,090
to give you a ninety what this the
impact of not giving up before any more

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,989
of moving to a BB 6 and the last spot
will be

13
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:47,538
would a swath moving to basics at the
anybody

14
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,680
be site for them using ipv6

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,699
so we all know by the way

16
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,870
I if possible I'm

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,430
more than happy to take questions on the
flyer I'm got some

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,530
giveaway for questions a small stickers

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,720
not too far away to see it but is
basically IPSC

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,700
equipment only in sight right is
basically for devices running on empty

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,290
for

22
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,869
and as I'm about is an of

23
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,369
or porn stores in open data but also
open book

24
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,670
we france he wrote a book about wireless
and the wireless

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,880
as of course and the pieces components
and I ruled the pot

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,030
this is a book which is printed here is
a giveaway but you can find his way on

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,350
the internet for free of course

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,169
so they're eating beaten or more ipv4

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,720
right UAB the dorm but that's it

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,929
they are less and less ipv4 addresses
available

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,470
he started two years ago where in-app
the big

32
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,439
forth under a season US for the complete
internet run out

33
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,169
then after weekly it was EPA

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,479
AsiaPac because they simply growing

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,360
so they were burning and using their
last the PB find receipt before us

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,090
ass assuming that most about the coming
from Europe

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,110
I'm basically for more than two years
based we are running out

38
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,379
meaning on you I speak if you want to
create

39
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,940
an Internet Service Provider be friends
you go to arrive to get the ressies

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,230
and you will get a wonderful one

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,929
downs on and receipts K if you want to
be a wise people you love election

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,660
that's fine

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,290
if you want to be a nice people you're
going 3 all your programs

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,790
would like is so that's a real issue
here

45
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,989
so basically what are they

46
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,540
system i doing because I mean

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,220
there is a war right we need to go sure
this war

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,629
or bypass the war one-way is what we go
do not stack

49
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,140
there's basically where the service
provider give you

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,290
ipv4 if you distill yes I'm ipv4
addresses

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,129
and a brand new protocol ham run you

52
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:16,609
meaning 97 I guess when most of us in
the room right

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,629
older then this

54
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,030
but they worked sans that they are
younger

55
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,959
than a BB 16 order as well so it's not
so young

56
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,680
okay so it's somehow the Internet
community

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,250
as failed on a sleek am incapable of us
are working in the IETF

58
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,440
with dry the standouts in the deployment
and we failed to push it right up

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,989
anyway so ipv4 ipv6 are there

60
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,230
this one we have running them on the
network you are stacked all

61
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,569
saigon thing against solution

62
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,439
which is the easiest one enemy

63
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,640
over No that people when they got
long-term

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,839
fix which is slightly more complex
always short term fix

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
which is easy we think the short term
fix

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,379
easy even it is dirty the short term fix
dirty

67
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,929
thats share that before that's basically
doing that on the dash kit

68
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,130
african-american this the thirst that

69
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,770
he said the v6 only surrounding the new
protocol

70
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,460
owning and accessing the ipv6 Internet

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,289
only and neck kissing at BV six content

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,449
only guarantees a colorful dream

73
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,830
most approving systems can do it

74
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,469
not to an application far less networks

75
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,320
and the content is not in there

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,599
miss network with the name of ipv6 only
thanks to 12 in the others

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
is not that too young to be six only
because and the edge

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,679
as soon as you reach your internet you
can go back in at BB for

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,070
right so it's not the net music's only
but it's a really good experiment

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,580
so water service provider we try to do
just that

81
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,690
and i got to slice on this on the left
hand side

82
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,180
assume that your home where

83
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,910
US on the left looks your router

84
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,229
and all the PCs which are there

85
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,810
okay and on the Internet in a BB for

86
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,620
but now the service provider is running
out the puppy before dresses

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,669
so we need to share right

88
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,698
so it's easy if you are receiving you
out five friends working late

89
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,449
and you order only two pizzas if you
have to make his ass

90
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,910
for five people that's a key right if
you get in enough pieces

91
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,490
everyone is good enough now

92
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,530
if you are five any order a small pins
out

93
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,448
that's where the problem is okay or as
to go to the cell to the fridge

94
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:08,509
and you get beers and the problem is
fixed right

95
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,300
and basically two beers disappear easy
got it right

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,600
its and afterward so what basically here

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,400
we have an issue we need to share so the
service provider is running out of

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,250
resource

99
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,789
right that an invite nap IP address so
in shari

100
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,169
in really good a nap eggs in its network
in big-box

101
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,280
recordist I a great knack cared rates

102
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,349
simply because vendors like my employer
can send them

103
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,050
for that money and then as well matters
the same thing

104
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,680
right now even running an ex inside and
doing at improve not much anyway that's

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,830
not

106
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,669
get so basically im an address here is
transmitted

107
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,130
once and twice

108
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,250
while on this 1 I'm pretty sure you can
fix copy tables

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,740
to do the right both for winning to
allow inbound connection

110
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,800
right foot your email to your web server

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,289
do you think a service provider will
give you access

112
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,240
to change the IP timbers their know
right

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,270
so we Hampton problem with it is we the
people you gonna

114
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,729
now if you add on the top of this do I
stack

115
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,130
and that's what more and more serious
what they can do because

116
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,710
if you will see if you are working only
to this kind of not

117
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,090
it's not the Internet as we know the
internet there is broken

118
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,169
they offer in green what I said dubious

119
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,258
right the Green Line is happy v6 and
then

120
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,940
there is no not and/or nighter and the
service provider

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,330
nor in this box

122
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,340
okay some people freak out because a not

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,068
means my security do you really want me
to expose myself to the internet even

124
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,210
security

125
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,560
I would say haha okay if you rely on
that for security one picture

126
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,800
different story I'm everyone is beyond
the not

127
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,940
and mostly PCs mean that the what not
calls right

128
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,990
but the one of our friends mothers
father and Manda all of them is but vary

129
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,530
cease

130
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,049
and back but the botnet behind a NAT a
clear

131
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,500
statement that another to protect you

132
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,039
but yet not even in a and a lot of
advantages which is C

133
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,260
so meeting at Avery content provider

134
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,450
no need to prepare itself to a world

135
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,620
where walk occasion right where inbound
connection

136
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,190
to your application to your content can
be

137
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,660
lag before a single to make

138
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,410
ipv4 address for everyone all

139
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,610
share the ipv4 or a mix of ipv4 and ipv6

140
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,790
right move deeper solution met you must
be ready

141
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,500
for them your application your service

142
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,920
so we only know that they are

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,319
only 65,000 TCP ports

144
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,690
right and even at this kind of naive

145
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,500
an efficient it means that for ipv4
address

146
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,029
the share by the service provider begin
its only 65,000 connection trying

147
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,680
portable 16 now if you sharing this at
the address

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,489
my 1000 subscriber Smith couple a street
in downtown

149
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,630
it means that Avery subscriber as only
sixty

150
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,189
connection I am a father of two

151
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,930
i acting weird 21 up three and three
eighths

152
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,609
one Android tablets one iPad everyone's
got a man

153
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,740
a laptop was a couple of device

154
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,290
it's not enough okay I have a general
session open

155
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,390
I F is MacBook line and refreshing every
time I need to win more

156
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,779
position and we all know that hijacks
relies on

157
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,220
a decision example

158
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,130
coming from Japan nectarines to the map
of on Broussard's downtown

159
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,200
and you know it Ajax downloading dice on
Google Maps

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,620
just think it's a visible example if you
are running out

161
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,790
of connection when you create a new ajax
request

162
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,589
what checked who cannot get a tight

163
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,930
I'm the map is empty on the map you see
it

164
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,660
now what if it's a game what they did to
a banking application

165
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,990
when you only get back up the
information

166
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,420
you operate cash in at least massieu
Barack

167
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,800
that when he gets try to get an open a
connection to Ajax

168
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,699
it can fail okay grace we failed in this
place someone

169
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,160
a warning that a question for you

170
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm not sure though you know what's PDS

171
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,459
10 speedy okay so

172
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,880
forget to ask night

173
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,220
speedy is basically I'm TLS connection

174
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,670
where you make the Plex issue pp
requesting it up a bit

175
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,170
so all in the HS connection up before on
the matter on map

176
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,969
will go over a single TCP TN decision

177
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,250
okay so you will not beg me this be a
few

178
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,600
by the some point of time it we fail
anyway

179
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,200
you can simply open law that more
browser window

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,070
and that's it

181
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,250
reputation now

182
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,959
and %uh no matter who are working in
today and the spam world

183
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,518
but to oversimplify if you receive an
SMTP connection to

184
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,750
risk sending an email coming out of some
countries

185
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,510
I am again just that they give us. let
me Jerry a

186
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,480
Ryan you may suspect is coming out of
spam

187
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,070
and some very specific IP addresses

188
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,470
I retreated as spam because our open
relays for instance

189
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,260
right on the part of a botnet you do it

190
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,610
for ipv4 address

191
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,680
Perry now if your home post is beyond
this big guy a great not

192
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,060
you are it is a demand guys there

193
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,589
we've 1000 at a good guy it brings a
reputation of the shared ipv4 address

194
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,630
the one used by these 1,001 people are
when they go to the Internet

195
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,350
as bad okay so you'll go demanding

196
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,430
could be mocked as spam not good

197
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,630
or vice versa the spam could be

198
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,160
a categorized as ham is good

199
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,339
not look all do you protect

200
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,510
any server in this case a web server
against User

201
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,600
trying to do a DOS against you

202
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,930
such ace sending your request

203
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,300
to your content management system for
search

204
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,979
already search can you sustain per
second on your server

205
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,480
maybe 100 because it involves a couple

206
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,589
seek will be I now what if one guy

207
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:34,040
is sending you 1000 SOC requests per
second

208
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,230
no money look into your lock and your
blog

209
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,510
this ipv4 address right

210
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,970
so now there they should reputation
again

211
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,310
you there was one bad guy me and the CDN

212
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,479
launching this one thousand search
pursuant

213
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,120
you broke it you block the other
customers

214
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,779
sharing the same ipv4 address so need to
find something else

215
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,970
its Web you can use cookies for instance
right

216
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,120
all it is the case where

217
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
a friend of mine and he was using it on
my phone

218
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,149
and searching on Google simply who gonna
love you sleep need to protect against

219
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,010
heart attack

220
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:21,199
but what good idea no it was my phone
beyond the CGN

221
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,550
and there where most of the 100 to 200
people are

222
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,920
beyond the CDN during the surge in the
same time

223
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,029
so that it would be eight years with
anyone

224
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,230
but it was back as an attack and block

225
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,350
thanks the ketchup basically to prove
that you are you

226
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,709
and the other pot I mean or application

227
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,829
more so than I would and when return

228
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:51,979
but they are be attack at some point of
time if you will

229
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,089
application is some value it would be
attacked

230
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,440
and in some case you want for supposed
to make a complication more secure

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,709
but in some case you may want to trace
back to see with attacking you

232
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,359
it become much much more complex right

233
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,430
because I lot not kid was doesn't mean
anything

234
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,630
service providers now needs

235
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,889
talkin locks on the translation Singh K

236
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,360
this subscriber and that's basic pay of
time

237
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,120
Usenet IP address is that the right now
and this TCP ports

238
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,209
meaning now in all your locks

239
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,359
even if you don't want to go to the ipv6
route

240
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,920
in all your locks for whatever
application you need

241
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,240
%um if you are looking good removed IP
address

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,779
you also need to look accurate time

243
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,060
and port the remote box the CPU TP

244
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,060
so in case an incident we can trace it
back put this all together

245
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,500
and that's basically what they're
spending on the side

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,630
if your home application uses Apache

247
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,320
there's basically one way oh you can
configure Apache

248
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,709
tomb to London the port and that's
basically in right

249
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,329
what's happening here so a friend from

250
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,269
a few from Yahoo rock Ryan this

251
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,259
NBA seen this that's a big think is a
CDN

252
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,440
and you see it wanted percent loan it
and basically it means that

253
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,070
on the left hand side you have multiple
IP address 20 per subscriber

254
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,320
but they appear to the Internet in a
single one

255
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,990
and by the way you're also losing your
location there

256
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,620
so if you look damn you see see black
theater

257
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,339
SGC the EPL goes right lacks hundreds a

258
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,190
or Flacco plant and you see is well here

259
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,790
men guy like the bad guy

260
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,160
and he's a bad guy me a

261
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,250
and that's what I explain what are you
deaf to

262
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,919
getting everyone that's basically the
Internet

263
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,949
that we are heading to okay

264
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,199
it's not the internet we knew three
years ago five years ago

265
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,829
if you want to keep the internet we knew
Priya five years ago

266
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,059
we need to get the move and move to a BB
6

267
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,980
so let's talk about it

268
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,360
hakim I tried

269
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,750
am to summarize ipv6 in one slight

270
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,320
so one thing is basically the same thing

271
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,159
is like ipv4 much we've much larger
dressings

272
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
such thing like 128 bits

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,809
rather than 32 gave you did we live in
back

274
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,299
there is no not K only explain it
doesn't bring

275
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,980
anything I am again security it even
make things

276
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,230
simpler cry because there is no not

277
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,289
this configuration everything which is
simple is always more secure

278
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,179
something which is more complex so
security

279
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,320
defending player no need to change

280
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,960
your Ethernet your WiFi we're on

281
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,280
and changed the transport layer

282
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,480
the socket API that you are using for
TCP

283
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,390
yupp or whatever no change

284
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,860
application themselves and changed

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,370
an app with quote because on spending
they're worth my talk

286
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,000
explaining what other change but
basically postfix

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,150
DNS whatever you want i running
perfectly fine

288
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,309
over TCP the protocol even change

289
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,820
so basically it's ipv4 its nine a better

290
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,899
a no more secure arm

291
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,169
is we despise I said a long time ago

292
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,400
everything is pretty much I don't again
including at the security or SSN

293
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,880
am they were the same arm

294
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,200
the only benefits on this lease a bigger
space

295
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,330
and to benefit on the bigger is better
they said we get back

296
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:22,330
the Internet we had five years ago and I
think it's important

297
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,620
128 bits that's a long long long number

298
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,330
the only way to do it is to ride them
innings anything that

299
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,549
right everyone eights eggs an issue 9

300
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,820
and you will have to explain shortly to
your daughter out to your girlfriend to

301
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,340
your boyfriend or whatever

302
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,689
all to spare and that very same address

303
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,830
it was already difficult with them not
be before address

304
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,080
even more we simply block damn group
damn

305
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,699
my four digit Kagame reported to be
taken to the max

306
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,890
and Amber keep away some writing it I'm

307
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,880
they are of course letters black AB CD
EF

308
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,159
it again right to know a case in
uppercase

309
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,799
also me now you need to be search
insensitive

310
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,379
in your text via whatever and you also
removing zeros

311
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,740
game because leading zeros are useless

312
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,419
and block of me deeper global Zero's

313
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,730
can be suppressed and replaced by a
single gone gone one

314
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,159
good even be yet you have this address

315
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,210
in at BB 6 which is the equivalent of
the 127

316
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,470
001 the loopback address right

317
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,059
and 10 arm you replace Borders Group
zeros

318
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:47,960
my column called on and %um address
which is grown green one

319
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,429
so you see games now a pink t-shirt
aving

320
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:56,220
there is no such place a concur in one

321
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,299
Mike thats Nash teacher arm

322
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,000
this one with order 0th which is used
mainly for the Fort Rock

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,210
on the basics address when you do not
know yet you out the address

324
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,980
before zeros is written in crayon going
on

325
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,500
I mean I'm used to it by the first time
you need to scratch your head

326
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,570
if you see an error message you address
is Lanka done

327
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,889
you gateways my address right

328
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,030
but is there of course then

329
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,590
with such numbers you really need

330
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,580
to get the NS working and DNS

331
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,010
a spoon waz with ipv6

332
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,280
cocaine US in the ipv4

333
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,710
you get the a to translate the hostname
for IP address:

334
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,590
and you get the reverse mapping because
the PTR record to translate

335
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,860
a nappy for address into an end

336
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,120
in May 6 we've got the same thing up
because neither the disinfection

337
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,090
and we have their look what a

338
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:10,809
to translate a name into an ipv6 address

339
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,850
now if you wander why Aquat

340
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,980
a that's important

341
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,490
a was one that defied US took it to bits

342
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,539
soak what a is for four times longer to
a cease

343
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,908
128 bits like ipv6

344
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:31,530
and as the restore now

345
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,899
the reverse is of course you need to
spell out

346
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,280
order numbers its most impossible to do
with my aunt

347
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,289
can you need to get to use the one doing
it and the last one reef

348
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:48,610
a DNS in the case of the NS you need
them

349
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,908
put ross called the DNS request you can
do it over IP

350
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:56,690
before what the v6 its October now right

351
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,350
you can send a request for nappy v6 and
rice

352
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,799
all over are not be be four you TP or
although an ipv6 a DP

353
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,780
and vice versa what's your request

354
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,330
over the NS it snowing with the
transport mechanism

355
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,750
could be completed at and divisions

356
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,179
readiness how we're going to do it

357
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,760
yes for many many years okay router
switch a species OS

358
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,620
whatever you want everyone is ready

359
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,010
application Microsoft Mac OS

360
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,030
are and of course so many times longer
the landings in to be as the

361
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,649
as well King so this not so much an
issue

362
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,020
on the operating system or on some
application

363
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,320
own lot a publication specifically to be
the main open source

364
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,740
I do I stack for many many years

365
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,220
I don't remember when Apache get the 64
the time running an Apache server

366
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,860
over ipv6 since 2005

367
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,439
right and it was at fifty-six so it is
you

368
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,440
all much the open source community
machine on Wednesday

369
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,880
great distance quickly and you need to
understand if you think

370
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,669
and friends than dozen why we need to
talk about the NS

371
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,799
I ever do not stack PC on the left

372
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,510
and I asked any kind of server stick its
Web but could be whenever you want

373
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,150
I put ipv4 Internet and ipv6 Internet
over there

374
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,320
black to clout but actually that the
same of course right

375
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,710
does the same router this hill to get
fibre the wifi whatever

376
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,940
is the same but this easier to show you
on this like

377
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,860
now in the PC wants to visit

378
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,320
that same a server for the comp

379
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,620
he asked to is dns server a what and v4
and v6 addressees

380
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,029
to request by the way and in this case

381
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,110
this and I will reply 8 he added to and
receives

382
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,908
one before 186 menace

383
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:16,740
apt to the PC and this may be what looks
like a surprising

384
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,590
its apt to the client to the initiator

385
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,610
to decide whether to use ipv4 ok we was
up 86

386
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,570
it's not up to the application on the
right hand side

387
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,470
is not after the serb on the right hand
side to the site

388
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,380
okay many we go one way or the other way

389
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,059
not be easy and own the decision

390
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,408
it so he's done by the shitter two ways
of doing it

391
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,320
they some kind of lookout for TC weaving
the

392
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,330
operating system on the initiator the CA

393
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,699
here this set of my addressees reform v6
yeah the set

394
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,720
of accuracies people in b6 on the server

395
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,960
which one should I use and it said
internet is try to make a good decision

396
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,900
there

397
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,590
or you are more pragmatic and you rely
on the stove written by Dan wing Andrew

398
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,080
Andrew being the guy with the curly hair
and beauty shouldn't go from there

399
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,490
right which is API ball

400
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,730
I'm or being this in English right and
you want to keep the user

401
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,270
on the application happy and oh you know
it

402
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,408
my ensuring that you stopped connection
v6 first

403
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,520
you where they don't you could not be
for connection

404
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,129
and then you use the fastest one

405
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,370
summarizing okay

406
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,799
so if this is faster you get v6 it
before it's faster

407
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,908
you take me for is most of them are
mostly equal

408
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,980
typically you go every six

409
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,200
so far so good

410
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,350
to my understanding only chromium
implements

411
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,500
this RSC put together

412
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,140
we've on the big surprise Windows and
the way 6

413
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,320
do something different

414
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,820
so now mean is gonna flap over right

415
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,990
it means the application on the right
hand side me a pic to understand those

416
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,220
three different behaviors

417
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,010
and be ready for them and you don't know
it

418
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,140
because when you stack you receive the
TCP SYN

419
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,750
the don't know right there is no user
agent string there

420
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,380
that way later that you get to use a
just three

421
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,779
so content if no intrinsic

422
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:45,020
so what you can do as well is using
something Cornet 6-4 and is basically

423
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,010
what their them the wifi team is using
here

424
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,169
where basically you ask the address on
the server

425
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,590
if you get v6 with Eric v6 as

426
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,270
you go to a specific box corn knack 64

427
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:06,330
between acting from ipv6 to ipv4 as I
said the application I'm change

428
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,100
is still a shitty PhD Amanda so you
simply need to change

429
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,939
the network layer ipv4 address Easter
BBC Chrissy's

430
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,830
and Chapala beaten some deal and yup

431
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,020
easy

432
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,289
you can do it as well on the server
sites

433
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,340
so in this case market that Europe's

434
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,809
in this case I F ipv4 only servers

435
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:37,360
and I'm using its a some kind of if the
proxy

436
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,570
mainly for SSL acceleration on a Web
cashing whatever

437
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,210
so the people coming from that he's
going to net go traverse

438
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,980
on the DMZ maybe if I wore but there I
for the reverse proxy

439
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,700
okay by major issue a proxy whenever me
for

440
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,850
going to the ipv4 server

441
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,779
or does proxies the application proxies

442
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,520
so they can receive a connection all
over ipv6

443
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,570
on the left hand side do the proxy

444
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,600
and the application layer and coming
back

445
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,820
to a beautiful so if you know

446
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,309
ok to deploy a proxy in HA proxy or
vanish or whatever

447
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,830
is trivia to move your content your
application

448
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,678
26 little issues not doing it

449
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,020
I can do it the tricks

450
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,379
impact on the application me different
thing

451
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,890
would receive when the packages then on
that that's basically the agenda

452
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,899
on the next flight

453
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,850
as I said before own lot of application

454
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,178
are ready for ipv6 archwood

455
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:55,649
points and is very complex in mind you
need to type

456
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,689
this command on this to say to me to be
sure that you'll be sent to address

457
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,120
gordon kahn can remember Crown Court on
means

458
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,209
full zeros meaning and unity is
basically so it's

459
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,510
don't be surprised if the ways we don't
I'm in Postfix whose need to say

460
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:18,510
I did for the course equal so very very
simple to configure

461
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,668
are there any ipv6 on the networks there
is this one here

462
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:28,830
there's certain that which is basically
the education network in China

463
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,129
and a few others including and nothing
is important

464
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,970
t-mobile in US which is about provider

465
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,409
for the 4G network they're using Android
phones

466
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:47,039
with only ipv6 sweet me that of course
is the user

467
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,029
see needs to go to some legacy ipv4
content

468
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,960
the obviously P the will to win that 64
books

469
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm we started with a couple of I ipv6
enthusiastic

470
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,709
a nap be4 ipv6 only day

471
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,019
K so we signed the petition and we are
the No 200 now something

472
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,720
I feel free to join and we send 20
employees

473
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,870
on that day I remove ipv4 from my laptop

474
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,070
I do give me the tools to work or simply
I do

475
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,539
whatever what I can do with that would
be six

476
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,990
okay so that would be gonna change into
the Friday

477
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,519
mistaken so that's always a bit easier a

478
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,580
seeding coverdale and in the same vein
and just

479
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,850
hear about it last week I B is the
$10,000

480
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,990
is a specific email we've got I net

481
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,269
protocol family only 986 so install it

482
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,029
and you get only ipv6 bought this
academy

483
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:55,149
extreme of course right I

484
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:59,590
but if we do not try if we do not push

485
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:05,610
the world is my changing okay so we need
to keep hammering this

486
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,750
so one thing kasinga to need to
understand

487
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,760
as when an application identification
layer right

488
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,730
if you ever saw kit for TCP outp you can
send whatever size

489
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,330
of segment message you can write 10k

490
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,500
and for you it looks like its atomic

491
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,990
but this you know over the Internet is
limited to 1500 bytes

492
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,080
so it's chant in small pieces

493
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,668
finer now something's us more than
others

494
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:41,899
and the need for something we call by
empty you

495
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:46,610
and few meaning maximum transmit unit so
wait to discover

496
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,019
the shortest back in the past between
the client and the server

497
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:54,669
okay happy 4th exist

498
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,470
in a visit as well in that the fighting
does not work

499
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,450
welcoming the because routers

500
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,010
on the path when you receive a big
packet any

501
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,379
to send to something which is more
packets it we

502
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,519
fragmented a key for its working fine

503
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,210
in Apia v6 in ninety-seven they wanted
to

504
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,230
optimize their altars and basically say

505
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,620
growth rising basic receive a big packet

506
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,750
on the other sites small packets I drop
the packet

507
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,490
deluxe right meaning it's now in the spa
seem to discovery it was my kind of

508
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,850
magic

509
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,639
actually I simply packets right to
discover the smallest

510
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,289
packet size on the path mass work

511
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:45,669
now implementation a broken some
securities people are stupid

512
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:50,269
right in that not work so we need to
change this

513
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,960
and one easy way of doing it

514
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,919
debts by doing an option when you open a
TCP socket

515
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,269
to said what he called the MSS

516
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:06,340
the maximum segment size so the maximum
segment

517
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,750
that you are ready to receive over TCP

518
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,929
do something with this morning after so
you are sure it will go on

519
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,859
gave re line and is a value which is
there

520
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:22,359
so is commonly used by be content
provider right now

521
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:28,290
simply could not rely on past him to his
career to work

522
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,199
36 no more not enacting

523
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,540
debt the best sinks okay

524
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,079
we are now open to worry

525
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,010
peer to peer communication where there's
beat around

526
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,829
or re phone or video whenever now

527
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:51,800
a week time you play the phone cord is
sick or whatever

528
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,629
you are beyond that you cannot retry
versus you always go to somewhere

529
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:01,029
in the cloud to act is a really right

530
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,820
a using Skype friends dance Mingo the
relays

531
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,060
iMac was a do you want to place
according to Microsoft in US

532
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,509
sup to you right but we've not

533
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,940
dead UN no choice but using race

534
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,849
in Napa missing there is known that so
in the gentleman there want to go to the

535
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:21,000
gentleman over there

536
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,810
they would direct we've on going to a
third party

537
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,490
this wonderful at the comment on
Microsoft right

538
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,799
but his will was there with I'm miss
multiple times

539
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,440
but something when they put this mock
regarding v6 their new in box

540
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,190
relies on the v6 simply because they
want to go direct

541
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,690
good direct for gamers is always short
racial go direct

542
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,220
than usual by a third party there's a
reason why they want to support

543
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,810
didn't support b6 also

544
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,970
not if you an application doing that

545
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,709
okay and using TCP not be nice

546
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,869
me to keep States need to remember a

547
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,200
this address in this post talks to this
address in this sport

548
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,790
and of course this memory if there is no
traffic to remove it

549
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,980
so your application right now me to send
people axe

550
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,400
over TCP right in a few minutes

551
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,680
simply talk keep this state Internet
device

552
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,879
ap prevented to be removed

553
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,060
now in ipv6 there is no not so there is
no need to send us keep a life

554
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,150
and we may some experi- ment in the
front framework about the battery life

555
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,050
from iphone wat r you lack keep alive
and sending radios

556
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,970
be changed a lot dramatically

557
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,779
if you want to send people ice quite
often well you don't keep send people

558
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,010
like

559
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,119
because you don't need to talk to
maintain state

560
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,050
in on that ipv4 sorry important

561
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,320
now when writing application

562
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:09,540
we need to be way and that the ipv6
address East a much bigger

563
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,099
arcane looks abuse I'm

564
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,670
so you need to enter the screen which
are no the input

565
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,930
and the output of the season dresses
sample configuration file

566
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,299
if you store it in secret a base you
need bigger fielder

567
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,520
your lock need to understand it looks

568
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,720
easy but I was looking ones

569
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,189
to a different application you know on
this small

570
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,599
payment terminal you getting shops when
you put your credit castle master cats

571
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,520
they do not they have nappy basics and
received his maximum

572
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,200
39 characters the white on this train is
20

573
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,930
okay condemn me its easy right we can
write it on tonight's

574
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,690
after all I mean we try to stop him

575
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,720
the keyboard now all many people did you
see know this machine

576
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,980
exactly see map

577
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,440
right none of them 029 there is no

578
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,109
abcd you now we can again right like SMS
Ryan

579
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:16,680
press twice with a zero and you get a
Chris tree down to zero get be or

580
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,299
whatever

581
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,619
not that easy I would love to

582
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:25,369
draw your attention to those to function

583
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,720
in group because as I said

584
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,660
the season to cease can be returned
immediately waz right noah K separate

585
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,480
case with editing 0 we voting 0 so
whatever

586
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,790
there is one single way to write it into
a cannon against former

587
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,910
and those two fashion basically trance
fair

588
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,920
from the printed ASCII to the network by
Larry

589
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,920
and vice versa in the right way

590
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,780
so that when you display any v6
addressees

591
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:02,619
police please this plate into the right
wing

592
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:05,859
so the same thing for the audit of
course

593
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:10,380
suck at the PI if you want to use this

594
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,540
kept on offense and has been man do at

595
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,140
back you can use mine stance this one

596
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,660
rather than that just lookin was this 18

597
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,020
whitespace for v4 and v6 a wonderful
later

598
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,820
you may as well now a 20.2 circuits

599
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,520
and do the same a good loop on the
Select on the two

600
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,060
one which is the four 1236 which is
quite

601
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,369
what the quite at the publication and
doing all

602
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:45,810
use a single one the 146

603
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,779
SSH my understanding is doing this open
SSH

604
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,520
and who cannot pay what if I want to
connect over ipv4

605
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,270
it's okay you are happy for connection
coming from the outside

606
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:06,430
we derive and maybe map into this can a
very specific basic address

607
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,640
where the last block is a v4 address

608
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,140
like to do me to fight be four you can
include them

609
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,540
into an ipv6 address space getaways
impossible

610
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,009
there's a reason why did on this week

611
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,839
now is to program in part by karnal
whatever

612
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,009
you don't care because usually you open
a connection

613
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,010
to a DNS name

614
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,440
annis ap to the library

615
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,230
to the magic work over the fall v6

616
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,690
that's where basically API Bowl can work

617
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,750
but we have seen that AP able to depend
somehow

618
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,069
upon the underlying operating system as
well

619
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:56,480
this RFC 64 24

620
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,810
and you see the table on the right its
looks pretty good idly

621
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,319
are I always need myself to reread the
draft

622
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:07,230
the I received understand what it means
but it basically means

623
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,740
a if I A look back and rice I use it

624
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,200
the higher the precedence the better I
will go in detail

625
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,109
but is basically what lanix and other
operating system is by default

626
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,259
and you can change it locally so

627
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,490
if your application is doing the right
thing I'm

628
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,339
system call and memory call it would be
processed by the server

629
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:34,950
price them okay

630
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,660
are you losing your pants afternoon on
up is there any ipv6 on

631
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,529
outside first I would encourage you

632
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,380
to use this ipv4 which is UN strengthen
chrome

633
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,089
when they are variations will depending
upon the brawl some and if this place

634
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:51,540
here

635
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,060
a this page is only been receiving ipv4
Economic Forum

636
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,279
indirect of course right if it's in six
this in green

637
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,069
right as usual and others so you can
really see

638
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:07,170
what's happening I would encourage you
to see because you see more and more

639
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,869
I mean all the usual do Gmail Yahoo to
Wikipedia

640
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:16,280
and so on and Facebook out over the 60 a
huge amount of web site

641
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,050
%uh 26 okay

642
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:25,230
ok can we measure and is basically what
I'm spending of my time here

643
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,140
I'm one-way to measuring its

644
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,490
is to measure subscribers

645
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:37,709
all can we measure or users

646
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,010
we rely simply on big website

647
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,880
and the biggest one doing it correctly
is good

648
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,319
and basically what they do they insert

649
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,550
one by one pic says you know also I love
the frame from

650
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,700
a negative positioning so you don't see
it if it's very so whatever

651
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,279
and the pics L you basically a I'll
fixing

652
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,780
three of them 1 which is an IP phone the
server

653
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,589
one which is not be six on the server
and the one hundred US tech

654
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:12,779
right and you as physically wrong number
B I

655
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,319
to now if the user factually beef on the
v6

656
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:21,109
is your stack effectually that before
singers that before

657
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:25,240
if H or in the six in Madison to be sick
on the network

658
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,450
very simple you can get that these two
countries

659
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,009
I've become a condom making his nap

660
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,440
%ah that's not exactly what I said on
them

661
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,589
one by one except

662
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:42,779
so what does it get

663
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,910
those are the two big numbers from
Google

664
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,649
and they're quite nice they are also in
some porn

665
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,650
very much opened it up in async sharing
data

666
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,109
is a very very important here so
ingrained is basically

667
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:03,799
the numbers on grocer's paving at the v6

668
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,310
and is growing we are currently slightly
below three percent

669
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,910
it's a doubling every nine months cannot
read

670
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,109
which resist am from Major Wright

671
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,900
and usually are my country is assumed to
be that

672
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,540
like it through the clean it. compared
to Milan's

673
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,690
Germany or whatever and again

674
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,750
thanks to the the numbers from Google
are simply doing some number crunching

675
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,930
there

676
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,930
and if you look about the purple one

677
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,879
this is Belgium where we have just
slightly nine-percent

678
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,050
on the user's switzerland is on the top

679
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,750
is around 10 that variation simply due
to the kitchen or whatever

680
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,000
so if you do an application it is v6

681
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,710
East not for the beauty that's because
they are you was a BIA

682
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,440
and you can also monitor the web content

683
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,810
spent all the way to the web content

684
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,119
you simply don't know again an open data
source

685
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,310
on them 1 million most visited website

686
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:14,450
an troopers cripple prime you try to
reach all of them

687
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,868
and it originally 6 lackey and it gives
you something

688
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,640
like a turtle scarce where you see going
up a nap

689
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,779
this one this date was June two years
ago

690
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,579
the world v6 launch where the big
website

691
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:34,710
or jump to Gator anybody 6

692
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,220
denied there to do it back this

693
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,569
alone so they do it for one day

694
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:46,589
in June 2011 like is that why you see
the peak here

695
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:51,839
and ended with 24 hours just a test

696
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,810
if you put this on a map and you can see
it

697
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,869
on their website I on six lap

698
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,640
you see time the Czech Republic annex
umberg

699
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,230
and the best one got the green and this
book

700
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:12,140
case to again to be website every
important here

701
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,720
meet the rents meter and support the
basics for many many many years

702
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,549
okay and meet current and Mac

703
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,099
I'm not friends see you can guess

704
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:27,339
did meet around and ipv6 like with
friends so

705
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:31,000
I wrote a meter and plant using the
parent

706
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,609
library and basically pretend to be a
bit torrent p.m.

707
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:38,880
and trying to download as much I'll as
possible

708
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,180
I was not good morning them and there
was something that right if

709
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,290
by any chance there is a police in the
room right

710
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,950
I've got nothing back out and then I can
measure them

711
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,490
and again you see own lot of greens by
the drina better

712
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,720
and the contrary I think it was Germany
with the most

713
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,020
Pierre doing v6 so my website

714
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,200
my my my client in January

715
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,069
about 60 percent of my German peer web
bb6

716
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:12,560
and forty where P before my ass of
course right

717
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,380
because happy for the IB and a knack my
country's damn

718
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,790
cadet only can that which we so the
numbers need to be taken between them

719
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:24,980
with some precautions here

720
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,059
okay with this I say I mostly just some
time we will be time for want to

721
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:29,950
question

722
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,689
or more after and not forget if you have
questions

723
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,660
you can book a stickers now in the
questions is that

724
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,660
yet nothing right

725
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,399
is it there is some

726
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,380
the question is about not 66 okay can
redo

727
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,270
not from ipv6 lucky 6 then the question
is 24

728
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,590
the ATF a standardized a nap in the
sixth network

729
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:09,980
to another ipv6 network it's mainly from
the fuming at this kind of stuff

730
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,090
but the idea sick not something I
something like complete the basic

731
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,730
network

732
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,560
to a single ipv6 address so there is no
not 66 like the sense of not enough

733
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,190
people

734
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,640
on purpose now to business customers

735
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,400
ask it so vendors like Matt Ryan Free
another's

736
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,430
do it but it's not under taxed any is
met

737
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,379
met okay I have okay I need to get
mastery page writes I'm okay with it

738
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,980
matter

739
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,550
so read a book after a

740
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:47,340
highly would get my how do I get my
internet provider

741
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,210
to give me I P 56 okay ok to push
opportunity for

742
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,230
your ice-t_ provided to get the basics
so first if you want to try

743
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,550
and that's what I've been doing them
meant if I want to Kortina

744
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,590
provider that you're a candidate redox
is excess

745
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,780
get a foot in their brokers who find it
basically US or something i text books

746
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,650
and then all your network 801 office go
through an annex

747
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,020
recorded a six pack is simply not be
before packets in San

748
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:19,500
working fine it was for me for many
years I'll to push a system like maybe

749
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,730
it is I mean for the accent I guess you
are from Germany course

750
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,240
out you don't know that yet sorry both
three guys from

751
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,930
not advance no asking asking and asking
her

752
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,100
another book for you if you want or in
August figures right with I think if

753
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,230
only for your provider

754
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:44,110
I guess

755
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:50,420
sir he said japan's already run

756
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,090
power much PCs

757
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,470
the law they joel stein but with and

758
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,759
eighty or something the their actions

759
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,260
on the current or no japan itself

760
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,710
happy they give pianists

761
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,720
with the service

762
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,720
%uh the fact recurrent right not just

763
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,009
up

764
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:28,009
it is with the flight anyway thank you
for your attention by the way

765
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,319
so now you on a quest right he never let
me be safe when going on
