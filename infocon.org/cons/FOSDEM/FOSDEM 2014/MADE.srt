8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,820
developing I passing later but I still

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,150
Ameritech literary prize from I

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,949
a self-organizing systems it what we
call it a day I can you provide incall

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,070
added made a messy for TV show

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,399
their minds I'm and you don't follow
lassie a

13
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,600
entry try and send us an email
everything okay

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,079
we're going just had that problem that
we are going to to address we're going

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,789
to

16
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,520
talk about the the archetypes we're
going to percent I missed several youth

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,510
to develop a

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,129
in our project finally I a pic sample a
on

19
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,589
Holy See implemented inside made okay

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,859
are you familiar with is carrying who ya

21
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,659
flight as Skyrim a lot of people out by
the scary

22
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,090
you know these guys early today

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,240
you are laundry on here lou is looking
for Luton fighting enemies

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,710
and you find this guy well I used to be
in a bid to let you

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,429
until I receive I i'm not go to any you
take on button

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,909
you are II really sorry you continue
fighting enemies and you go to another

27
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:27,600
to CP

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,229
I used to be an adventure ladue they
have received a narrow to any

29
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,060
okay you you to you to over do you think
it's about time he I hate me

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,400
unit continued give me everything I used
to be an adventure let you

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,600
are you say okay it's not very game they
receive

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,289
yeah it's okay maybe he's this is just a
game

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,380
another real-life okay so the DA say how
to develop these characters

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,679
to egexa I an interesting literary

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,270
blood because usually this kind of
thought you know I A

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,729
a cuddly this guy descriptive they are
they are escape today

37
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,509
by hand but if you have a lot of maybe
hundreds of a number I have got a

38
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,240
cutting games

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,369
it is very difficult to create liter a
plus for all of them

40
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,819
so our India is present a mess up to out
to magically

41
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,160
and Max deleted it. blood weaker and a
being numb

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,230
but it got close with some parameters
that

43
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,859
in nashville it I plot okay

44
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,770
you know what I could die Zeit are I
don't get it. so I

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,760
military concept it universally
recognized that for example

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,250
the follow-up any role rice

47
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,250
and then he comics something evil I have
to be

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,790
redeem for some but not obey their event
was a hero

49
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,459
and the following day at our site on the
force and then

50
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,050
he kind he he he killed a the Emperor
I'm

51
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,450
here started good I A on the other big
cum archetype the hero

52
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,909
is some he started to like i farm air

53
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,950
you know I and CM 10 very a

54
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,829
stupid planet for the Sun and he he came
out to a fear

55
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,209
a great hero guitar I could not bring
something but you got in a lot of ways

56
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:09,680
to use

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,950
in every study you see a rather watch
the movie they are

58
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,790
architects believe I said I reckon I
said other archetypes for example

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,909
the Chavez been liking what is seeing

60
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:26,019
a house I just saw a smoky and we don't
that the biggest

61
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,599
sorry I REI however today's I get that
nervous

62
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,159
so I other active I started to

63
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,829
the lobbying for some peace and normal
guy he's done such a vote

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,640
and the way he came back to lou to the
shy he said you bear some

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,738
he said more mature all there are two
types

66
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,090
deal otherwise and a lot less mad like
this one

67
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,870
for example only one cannot be is their
demand your job going to

68
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,170
to get song expert dice and advice yes
by you

69
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,939
and to become a hero thanks to him other
the stepmother

70
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,239
home a stepmother are investors a lot of
this their mothers

71
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,970
usually they are bad I'm I and for
example the hump day

72
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,540
the hamlet archetype very pressing for
something I don't think

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,519
blanking is hamlet with animals so if
there are many patterns very

74
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,340
reconcilable

75
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,578
in a lot of air and books and movies and
games

76
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,910
so by setting the same idea we want to
model

77
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,850
this existing architect that we know
that works because everybody

78
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,540
are using it using them and their
mothers

79
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,449
the ASU awesome like that environment
let somebody a game

80
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,750
you know case we are starting with %ah
ourselves fair

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,410
Anji hey we have gone so to me sir

82
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,540
police a stories I'm archetypes

83
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,949
are amazing the air we are going to it
to you said it but I'm a touch of the

84
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,470
agents

85
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,690
for example I know the hungry level
danger level

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,219
their relationship we have with other a
yes

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,820
et cetera and optimize these primate
that with a genetic that I i Griffin

88
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,099
to alot story in mexico system

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,380
or in a video game or in something look
at me for spam and you know anything

90
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,020
about genetic algorithms

91
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,289
yeah everybody knows this good

92
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,969
welfare for table for a while and that
they're known doesn't know what he's

93
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,990
the optimization methods stochastics
that the

94
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,220
missing population bass said there's I
love year

95
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,960
using and the program what they say show
and that while there are a lot of

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
income friends both silently they are
very easy to understand

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,979
but is not there it is called for this
presentation scientist

98
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,300
to skip it finally reducing the cysts
the say

99
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,330
the size 10 to write a scientific papers
because I am from the University I you

100
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,229
know what may happen University

101
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,150
police are prized so we are forgetting

102
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,250
being write papers what papers so we are
using the say

103
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,700
mythology a system to make yes ladies

104
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,090
you know what about love will live on
garth may seem weird science

105
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,020
that aired you can read or pay but why a

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,479
you know there is still a under
consideration in a conference

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,750
a you don't follow or Twitter West when
they say

108
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,110
police said we will send you if you want
and now it's time to or

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,400
can play with her then by the
environment okay remains going to start

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,200
okay to meet I'm am as you

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,460
me know their Jen genetic I'll anything
stake

112
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,680
long time to work told him

113
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,740
I can't wait to the some things here bat

114
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,080
it do think long time anyway

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,240
as a test I will launch somethings

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,250
yes the these meetings and this is the
application we have them

117
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,310
and but I will explain it

118
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:05,310
later but

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,910
no I experimented staying executed whale
his their a preamble

120
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,200
the prime and I don't think I have
anything to try to optimize the

121
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,789
parameters

122
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,220
about whole environment let alone about
that is environmental game

123
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,390
yeah okay

124
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,659
the you the someone knows we see it here
policing

125
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,430
he he's Terry Pratchett is the creator
of this world and there

126
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,310
and we have chosen well I will start you
know all the

127
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,390
we we need and product to and the

128
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,890
the first the best approach to create a
character

129
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,120
is to choose obey basic Wong so we
thought about

130
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
animals and we with a bad it could be
very great

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,700
at 22 to in marriage and

132
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,760
and behavior that

133
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,320
yeah usually I and as he did with human

134
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,070
so and we we thought that the side is a
test

135
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,330
and environment so we thought about the
rest and

136
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,960
we we wanted but sadly I'm medi-cal and
we thought about the drought that needs

137
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,900
and that even say that behind a and mmm

138
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,070
in the civil you know she and local so

139
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,460
and BC's very simple

140
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,239
and this a simplification of arrest we
went to the Wikipedia and we

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,760
we we still want to rub basking in any

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,289
like and we we we selected is that

143
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,370
we thought we did that work important
for us so

144
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,030
at that can movie eat attack defend

145
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,260
escape and find a mate

146
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,410
and have another up spring and

147
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,969
more and they that that's almost hold
how we have the USB does something that

148
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,280
people

149
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,050
a so this is %uh thing at the Sigma Team
that

150
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,120
all those the things that we have them
and we have selected

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,840
very a clear language that we we can

152
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,310
and lately and and with me

153
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,869
we went we can use to find you can
express your sweet we can mother

154
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,390
defenses to find about that that well
when we're looking for so

155
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,819

173
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,910
so and we want to evaluate the fitness

174
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,469
up for a yes and we we have in this
example so we have all

175
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,970
don't eat with their fingers for example
and I think you know if %uh

176
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,650
is outlet this motley smaller in this is
that more than

177
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,160
in the air if you just letting at that
these and a major

178
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,060
at least about but all I am eventually

179
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,189
he said affected by all the rest and up
to

180
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,540
i lame and this but affects the same but

181
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,069
this is not an event that you got the
right doesn't dawn

182
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,030
don't have a memory so

183
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,260
mmm all will will come though the labor

184
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,300
when we execute the 3a select the

185
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,979
and big population way around the
genetic a little

186
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,790
that me take care has no life employees
little traditional

187
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,430
a little operation we with lunch and
environment and this is

188
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,949
okay we only have a buddy 400 bucks

189
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,390
here and we find that one but he's
elevator

190
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,100
and you see you the phone he

191
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,260
that is not at like seven they thinking

192
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,360
and of the light jeanette 17 so

193
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,750
his behavior is not ec2 fine and to find
it it said we would have to choose

194
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,740
the correct but I'm at those in these SC
leaving invasion of Iraq who would win

195
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,220
match

196
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,930
and behavior but he's not and

197
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,239
that can be easily found on then invest
complicate relations

198
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,550
right thing a when doing so

199
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,030
but the process about action United I
think recommend another actions

200
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,750
we model the famous for the show for the
end for the kinetic I think to make sure

201
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,100
they actually need sold it but i
digress. a bad about today

202
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,780
Babyliss I we can use is he said the
Prime Minister every game

203
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,260
our price on both and police last week a
match in history

me that I D one-s_ had a

206
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,530
we have used a those one but they're the
main

207
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,740
mend a Mockingbird best really important
he's and a got

208
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,800
be there the and we have used for the in
the pelicans

209
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,630
and the this up with his yukio

210
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,530
and we have the lovely in the other hand

211
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,810
Lee that the service on my cell is low
all

212
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,189
the case so maybe it's not

213
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,370
so slow here's the thing yeah

214
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,250
so we will see how did the feeling that
the number

215
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,920
evaded in this case are you there
population

216
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,880
so yeah

217
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,550
lease is up a very big you study the
best yeah and a vision

218
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,640
possession so that is seeing the role
not only way he would have many

219
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,120
he does for example he needs anything
more complex

spending and we are

287
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,620
yeah anyway and the most important thing
think he s

288
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,928
he is that we had fun too model then
moved

289
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,190
of the story not that not the whole they
will

290
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,309
the wheelchair act when you find them
about ya

291
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:48,309
by the backstory of their a

292
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:01,660
yet

293
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,490
well he learned about know exactly it is
to develop

294
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,080
some Calif is to you wanna for somebody
to go to war

295
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,918
are Romeo and Juliet we know how we'll
maybe a

296
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,580
don't set of pics a number of archetypes
but I A

297
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,139
to see that rain day what their today I
will decide so I we want to know i won

298
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,710
this game

299
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,820
the Romeo and Juliet history whole by
some to be in love with two

300
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,059
rather there are and different families
you don't have to say yeah tell from the

301
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:31,620
couple at

302
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,918
and you are far the other ones but I'll
remember his

303
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,640
sits at my best but said as you define

304
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,520
a global history and a this is
automatically for the isolation

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,889
you a couple they tell you I want as you
are to me that you are Julia and its

306
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,390
history

307
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,020
is makes for a bad for the execution so
you are fading

308
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,549
and the the other guys are working while
you are playing for example

309
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,620
so the DS not to model every archetype
here today

310
