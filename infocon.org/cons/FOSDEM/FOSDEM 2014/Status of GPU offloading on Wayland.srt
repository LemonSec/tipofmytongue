1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,380
okay

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,490
so I'm going to take it to a bit if
you're fading

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,700
of on my own so manny's extent that yeah
I'm the student at the economic survey

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,440
of curries

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,559
so first to I will each

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,060
and tell you what's on the different
technologies in voted off

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,519
any individual a fitting and how we can

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,209
on the day next time we explain how
would he feel for the eastern and we've

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,250
X there I to and how it is and

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,910
event I mean shit to show the Holy we
decided to make it work with when

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,029
and to finish I will and

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,110
that how we can work with expand so

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,899
first the different technologies in both
in Japan the first their first because

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,670
she it we can have in mind e-zine

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,440
wondering so too are and then we have to
do. to repair

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,899
authenticated to to be able to run their
as the 20s their way to

17
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,579
to be able to one day is very is a.m.
Esther a dear Ms De for example the ex

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,180
event

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,150
and and if I am a client I can

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,640
opened the device and and generate a
magic number

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,000
which had been sent to the sever which
we'll and then use this number to

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,040
authenticate me

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,700
and I will be evident to 21 medicare is
a a recent

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,700
the over where introduce weeks she's
when the nodes and so when the nose

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,210
and at divest past that I can

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,839
open I can defend the device can then
and Monday we vote

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,880
a than enough the congregation betsy is

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,929
you I don't need any notification I
don't be a bird to the sense

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,680
someone's think status naked tenants so
what engines

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,130
so to check out the first between
defending

31
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,850
context is our on devices Verizon civil
whether

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,479
for school in you may know but as the
devices

33
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,560
at five hundred Chevy did it cats and
cats

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,229
it s it some Murray it's Andy RAM

35
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,810
so it's ani file device but in rhyme

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,140
you can and chair memory but between

37
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,940
over graft cats because a or to get the
cats can have access to

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,849
there I'm push have the cuz you have to

39
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,060
to have give and meaning to the behest
so

40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,720
many many play because you entree for
you mean many plates

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,050
hyundais which island s and this num
them behind you have a meaningful %um

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,430
mean

43
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,480
at the in for for you will be a perfect
by companies I uses

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,988
nice bets the if you want to

45
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,310
another context to use your name you
can't

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,670
the your home that you can generates at
him then

47
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,319
it's a name is a deal by and Hyundai for
our

48
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,480
and the device which means that everyone
we have this number only be able to

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,220
excess

50
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,489
to this effect Mets their its insecure
because

51
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,620
issue try and I guess the correct number
you can access to the perfect and since

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,220
then

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,010
the number of the stuff from one and not
meant to be run them

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,420
then the its easy to move to catch some
that the frozen

55
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,159
so it's doing secure and there I to

56
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,489
use them because it was a need because
you have a lead but at the time

57
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,760
to to shut because there but no we have
with so

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,890
prime Jenny Beth a fight the 3,000 weeks

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,569
describes once the the fact he's in wat
slight memory and heaves

60
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,260
at the right exit so insecure because
you can guess

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,370
or has information in to a pedophile you
have specific try seriously very secure

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,769
and we use eBay different we've went

63
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,159
and the right rear use any better when
uneven

64
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,798
no ability Marie speed so

65
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,530
a rendering 2 I'm is fast issue either a
direction and Twitter to vent for

66
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,170
example

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,950
18 in prior to that he wanted the app

68
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,339
the dow free weave their efficacy of

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,069
902 hits and and 128 pizza

70
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,018
for the tenant you have high capacity to
read and write so

71
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,080
a boat 14 to grace the second so in that
but fast

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,169
but if you have to you is the send it to
you

73
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:21,430
to exist in his favor memory for example
the PCI Express

74
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,860
today a slight and example of the

75
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,940
the today but he's on my computer and so
I and

76
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,729
eight lanes of the 500 make a heads best

77
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,508
and so that means I A the second I can
share

78
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,020
fun to get bites jeff is visit is this
if if

79
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,500
if I had an external device we find the
right it well

80
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,740
it would be a new one to give a specific
and so that's

81
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,770
mister where than XSD a direct access to
I'm

82
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,370
so how can about has

83
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,570
a meaningful for the few opening when

84
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,800
their a frisking a protesting the fair

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
is a vote eight megabytes make if I F
two

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,639
to share 60 frames per second it's going
to be added

87
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,539
and tomorrow which is a bit with 500
megabytes per second

88
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,770
so let's do it best

89
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,250
on May system which has and they can and
handicapped

90
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,389
at the both had their own a

91
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,940
memory access but there the andy Katz

92
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,699
the to talk to a prime has to go through
that PCI Express gen ed

93
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,009
and if Ireland very very light faced

94
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,419
which there then ani weeks

95
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,590
and then give the any indication and the
government said the coffee company and

96
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,549
the

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,160
under SB the memory if I say

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,449
when it rained this test in Iran

99
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,729
being telecast which has had success in
his prime we'll be over with dainty like

100
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,990
a second so it's the other

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,080
what we saw before we try starting to
make a second

102
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
the maximum so there is as slate he

103
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,229
Anita fun doing so that's why we don't
accept AMEX and that

104
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,389
Metro vain to get me so at funny

105
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,800
air a faith that time they say

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,380
frames because it it is limited by the
best expressed it

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,840
so likely and CS your application will
be

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,710
not like that hit me it will use that
this expert today to communicate

109
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,880
important data

110
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,770
so it leaves you feeling when you want
to use this gas to one day

111
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,758
you want you you shouldn't text expect
to have had a face like

112
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,930
use

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,270
know ebola paying you have how the feet

114
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,729
detain is this way of 30 during the pics
anything in memory

115
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,780
so that's your graphic at Wheeler rhonda
fester

116
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,969
we have their we be staying it's very
good took offense for example

117
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,449
on maintained cat which it playing as a
big year

118
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,830
pavements in fact we have been arena I
get three times my expense

119
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,349
it from Best against with a knee so
let's hit the jewish

120
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,380
entrance but for some application point
had any difference

121
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,940
bed the parental thing is that we come
to

122
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,770
give a benefit to and a cat and say okay
read it

123
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,008
if testing because the cup on Wednesday
nishini

124
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,960
infected so it depends on them and
there's an everything to the cat so for

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,099
example he's

126
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,110
with angie is runs and on my handicapped

127
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,710
and think that cat is being so they say
it doesn't choose

128
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,008
each thing through staying still a
caving to getting this done

129
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,190
and here its when I a little grainy kept
using

130
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,389
so we see that's for example did we pick
senate

131
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,020
up much more in nine thank you for
always it was a

132
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,049
and Jia and I so we can understand but
it's faster to

133
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,910
too many plates they're like bats that
we would like

134
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,580
these two to be showing property so we
will have

135
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,590
when we have to the reef 1321 E

136
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,690
we want to combine the half
high-performance updating

137
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,139
and the fact that we needed to share you
know before we feel

138
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,960
the capped so the what we want to do is
to one day to attend defend

139
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,008
and then do a copy to a younger for

140
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,740
when I mean I mean it nothing

141
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,650
and to finish we've the demand defenses
which

142
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,138
and when you are share 18:08 bat

143
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,879
which is what we do to share then that
the Fed between the two cats

144
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,159
had gotten offenses shared between the
two devices with the retaining

145
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,029
internally each cat has its own defense
is to say

146
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,080
I have not finished yet to write to and
is the fair way to beat before we need

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,959
and always fact that pretty well but
we've at two different devices

148
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,560
they want savvy senses so

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,930
Daily Show gay marriage and hopefully

150
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,279
a initiation we can which she is that
and then they met at Mattoon

151
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,380
no cost which argument differences which

152
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,330
which I chance fences for all the
devices in

153
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,540
and this week when with beaches because
there

154
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,199
then the two counts will share his 10
season

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,730
we do things correctly annex perfect fit
you have nothing to do with Jeep you for

156
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,110
reading

157
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,820
is that we can put your but you never
have to know efficiencies ousted outlet

158
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,290
which means that in use of space you can
know if their undoing as interest on it

159
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,439
which is good

160
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,570
know how doesn t feel for the network
with

161
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,290
act the right to so that they may not
make any sense to me to run day we thank

162
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,219
the right on

163
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,070
is I mikhail advance I am

164
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,810
a 32-bit accept a hey I want to win them

165
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,099
and and there is a space add me to say
and 12 under and

166
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,130
and specific devices and then to the
mainland

167
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,269
perhaps and then the x7 we give the back

168
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,610
past we opened the device had at the

169
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,600
the faded for bath which she's a device
and then

170
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,209
we have to attend can generate images
and they're saying it to the extent that

171
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,819
okay then the invade the right to skim

172
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,860
I have to ask the ex-governor and made
the present to

173
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,250
at which I used to wonder so

174
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,950
I we basque yeah I want to befriend okay
have accepting gifts but Jennings

175
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,980
so remember that it is insecure

176
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,149
and the okay only use it is dividend Jim
names to

177
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,640
to use it to get a buffet and when the
tweet when he does he need

178
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,199
wat when he says he's pandering it
retailed for Xmas nicht

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,029
between swept and X we could give it the
fed to the quantification

180
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,990
and if you have turned ability the
additional copies that we've completed

181
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,110
it's here

182
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,459
and when you do completing you want lol

183
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,979
the ex ever to compete with heat
whisking content

184
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,010
instead the except I will have to
compete with intermediate location

185
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,060
invent the composite so we have a cookie
air

186
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,569
what it is that you speak to me that for
cation to the screen so its took a penis

187
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,769
aware well as it could use anyone and
when

188
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,070
in there a free in previous and we have
anyone could keep

189
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,269
okay so how it's fax we'd if you're
putting

190
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,230
fest you have some County rushing to do
you have to provide

191
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,740
lead did the dan ed specific driver for
our each share

192
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,970
a device at the Dixie is a I Drive a
specific to a

193
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,410
XQ device and will have to be loaded the

194
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,939
at at least at as you can Eva

195
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,750
their rights what we want the it for the
next to be know this for a driver in

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,300
exam that concert but yes then fail are
its automatic if you don't have any kids

197
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,060
out the pope

198
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,180
a few sometime an explosive the are

199
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,279
the computer is that in you have to use
extender

200
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,060
to to say what you want to do with you
we use these devices in

201
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,589
you have you have two months the wind
use for example we've

202
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,560
NGF repair team favor east to have 22
for this day

203
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
price to pay prevented cap and when she
too far

204
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,250
are enduring thank them both for India
comes so

205
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,360
the it's ninety per opening 15 the
second one

206
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,899
is the fifth inning you have one GP for
display and I mean

207
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,720
and you have one can be used eventually
when he won't

208
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,800
and bass this effing specific ab12 is it

209
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,609
so here you we have to go to you on this
month each device we have

210
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,160
that provide and then and you can
specifically

211
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,319
at which provide the number will be for
these being in Mich

212
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,010
far a fitting and media I prime you can
say

213
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,569
provided when they come to is movies
provider for laundry

214
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,589
and often 0 ready for the ones being in
one

215
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,220
is for everyone a the second one so
that's why

216
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,490
you used your the right prime equal one
with

217
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,510
you when you want to lose to use this in
every device

218
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,990
so internally how does the tracks in the
X server

219
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,250
and it as you need to correct the DX for
you

220
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,100
anything you correct in Ames a on your
device

221
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,260
add but when you we can meet the the
defense

222
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,029
and the the location

223
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,410
the up the except that it when it does
the cookie

224
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,660
we have to be share the between the two
cats so far right it reuse the

225
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,990
prime in the best API and

226
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,260
it will have special codes invaded exes
200 vac in crates ATT number for

227
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,490
so leave nothing shared between the two
cats soviet the spirit prayer:

228
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,529
special code in in the the day xnx event
on the are back

229
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,070
when you don't have compositing and the
clans is for screen

230
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,029
the tag a tween be directly there for
screen

231
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,470
a s can we defend there will be an
action just so that's

232
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,990
its it is this event but if you don't
have to visiting

233
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,870
and your application is not for screen
UNC nothing

234
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,930
it will be at glaxo face just because
then

235
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,099
babies and no one who cast ability to
copy to the

236
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,790
the number fair share that to this
country's tickner

237
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,339
but when you have to visiting it is 9
switch works

238
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,740
and to make a key cheesin hair to remove
the cheeser

239
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,300
every time to differ we say but part of
the phased in London again

240
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,180
we say no over where the thirties and as
to be loaded

241
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,449
and it works bets

242
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,800
we've tapings solitariness is and

243
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,930
I'm just being a frame and I

244
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,290
right to live a frame when whereas I'm
MTC just being

245
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,180
so I i Avenue and no content in this
temp range is there is spent in

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,589
its doesn't look nice and

247
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:06,940
there is no synchronization a toy with
the screen refresh

248
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,459
bet at least the content is correct

249
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,109
that because you are West could be too
and the fair whose previous contents

250
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,990
wesat

251
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,480
correct that own then that even if you
read that

252
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,589
own at the fight has been finished
writing you will a civic election

253
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,570
because I as you remember there is
nothing less it show between the

254
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,880
the to the races in so one we went right
into the for India over we we did the

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,320
same time missile

256
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,320
so that but so similar there were two
victories

257
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,519
we can do we vote doing sweetie in this
situation

258
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,800
soho no can you make that weapon

259
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,060
so me when the the main you can use them
is that's then

260
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,560
Kia is are way above the past up the
device by

261
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,529
other competitor the composite essays I
use this caps

262
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,019
annual you can connect tweet I can click
on to get through tweets

263
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,670
if you want better the can I and Queen

264
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,490
also open another device and is PC user
if they want to know that the device

265
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,029
invent doesn't need it and station to
the compositor

266
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:18,399
and very injuries be different because
it doesn't ask any buffer to

267
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,360
to the server like for the ride free it
we had its

268
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,699
own settembre fasten we let make the

269
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,939
sever aware above is the first school
between cause then

270
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,509
in okay i know im his defense and pick a
plan B tches Len

271
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,779
London and then we send to the
compositor

272
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,480
and the compositor we we use it if it
can be the

273
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,000
are under two and then heard the front
and the compositor eventually when

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,470
it gets a new and perfect when we
reserve good one insane can

275
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,899
renews his birth again okay so

276
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,680
how can we make if you're treating me
back a busy weekend

277
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,750
and choose the device give it a nice we
want

278
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,810
at 202 and what we want we prove first

279
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,089
over the right to we want to remove it
to mean would be quite right

280
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,240
met only once since I can ease Asian so
it's possible would be done because we

281
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,630
have

282
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,760
a way to synchronize to lose to this
refreshes the compositor

283
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,250
weevil it actually care bill cheap you
it's a sort of

284
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,390
from comebacks and it would like it to
reap

285
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,630
to have at the East the have any
specific to

286
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,130
could in this ever so everything should
be clay inside

287
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,059
side so it's possible since the but and
knows the

288
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,539
the divisive the compositor it can
actually knows

289
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:44,500
when I I we deem to the compositor at
buffet can understand

290
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,140
so that might make sense and

291
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,700
he would like some startup but picks
apart in

292
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,630
have its own so if very first thing that
came there to mine

293
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,650
which is not very good is that to the
this ever

294
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,760
we could if we have even given mister of
or the castle

295
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,129
and we'll other advertise or the then I
can return to get too bad

296
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,510
okay and the knbc

297
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,669
oh I have already set up the for a for
device they can use it I V choose one

298
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,990
and then if it can withstand the buffer

299
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,780
the competitor can mean the can read
we've nothing

300
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,250
bets various seen it some issues if this
approach

301
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,559
we have justice have a psycho to medium
myself

302
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,668
order today if it is a few and we might
too simplistic at-bats

303
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,740
so we say but we we were like only

304
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,830
on when the notes the composite along do
anything what happened in cuts it but we

305
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,149
don't change anything to accomplish
deter

306
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,570
and it we're the everything will be can
cite

307
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,730
it for use on the notes and

308
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,419
in many deaf extra quid so everything's
the invite him

309
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,880
that's remember from eggs the right to
we had the way to specify

310
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,539
which device we want to use we had to
provide the number

311
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:09,370
which was mostly cause 10 because it was
there were far who went to Spain in

312
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,239
one's for

313
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,070
give the cats so he will have to find
something is

314
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,389
the device by the device path above the
device

315
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,860
is not consistent across reboot are
oppressor

316
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,070
a dates because the defense up the

317
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,189
this be the need to a bit driver

318
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,530
so we an we decided to wear light on

319
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,820
and but I refused by you then

320
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,260
and which at this we didn't start a
tribute

321
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,879
each and which looks like that so this
is the

322
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,789
the 85 tyke for my did you get it kept

323
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,720
and in when I want and to whom to use
these cats

324
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,400
at 2 under for example and Shima gym up
to I we

325
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,020
use this command bets things

326
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,520
it's a bit tricky to remember our backs
we decided that

327
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,280
no one will be a special meaning to say
that's I want never comes under

328
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,399
competitor

329
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,169
so when you have a need to capture if
they eat eggs overrun

330
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,590
a sweet to act but at in when you can
now launch

331
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,610
and beaded composite us and over the
think

332
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,090
and you can i watch PR inside as
compositor: and here we would like

333
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,668
to be had but we learned clients inside
a competitor unveil a dedicated cat if

334
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:29,380
you want

335
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,799
and and so if I a dubious

336
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,980
& Lounge and and the media compositor

337
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,549
and okay and we use a different device
and their

338
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:43,690
competitor which beat which is embedded
computer so

339
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,049
we are not using the device he once they
we only be using think that Kathleen

340
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:48,480
said a

341
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,200
the anti-catholic so here

342
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,370
will be the this sure where you are sure
what device would use the

343
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,649
and here it's a bit different company
computer

344
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,340
okay so hope they can be supported
because their

345
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,110
varies no 7 cite code to the TSU to
detect maybe the new

346
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,030
device in and do something with it tho

347
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,799
so that's good met as we said

348
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,840
that we are angry going to share a
number for Wii Fit

349
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,590
compositor when you that we don't use
the same count on the opposite a

350
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,120
so it isn't a team at two one that is
the for any said but

351
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,020
we want to run that with time befor into
a copy to a number for

352
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,220
so how can we do that and got two ways

353
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,360
the first where he say way compiz 18

354
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,110
its lights we can do completing 20
number for

355
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:48,110
so when I would let

356
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,740
ok

357
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,510
okay

358
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,490
so and vast 282 see

359
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,830
that two possible ways so the first one
is to launch a number to cope with it

360
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,330
done for dedicated cap

361
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,730
and right here inside we only know but
back what was it that use the

362
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,889
did you get it capped and we you staying
because they know they

363
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:27,039
becomes death paying because we've with
their competitor the

364
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,340
but the program that we've got a pretty
good between do some lag

365
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,970
because there is a an extra layer there
is Martha you consumption

366
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,059
and so it's not caned Quinn

367
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,549
bones I remember that's cool

368
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,370
thinking it's working again me remember
events we had the

369
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,928
my could say that we've the right we try
school in

370
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:54,240
matter content was okay even defense it
didn't work

371
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,200
so here we have we have this by then
because we

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,370
we won then we even prettier and under
for tool to the computer

373
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,899
and it won't and it won't be cooking
copies are

374
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:09,949
on on radio correct the phone and

375
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,320
so the if you do that

376
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,559
if you didn't do it he show over there
for it will be

377
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,950
said the skinny black car it will not
show the great content

378
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,679
so you have been to have a smile I V to
so that the

379
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,720
completely ruin anything issued and
thought

380
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,120
RightNow but need a solution we give
that to make

381
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,739
content because this thing anyway it to
say when do we could be mean that and

382
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,169
10 there could be there for that

383
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,649
we have a good season we've missed
approach because we think that

384
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:41,500
definitely not

385
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,039
management I mean and in the comp with
their will

386
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,820
just read the the the black content in

387
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,830
but the week at what when they do the
cooking we can say

388
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,658
where I we wait a bit before committing
bedroom wondering if you need

389
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,649
sewing acre island 28 th and but

390
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,178
it is a me feel if the very in back
difference

391
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,750
because at when you finish main tenu
Thane

392
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,649
facing double then the for then there
will be a long time

393
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:14,830
early for youth pain new on the mean
comments to the

394
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,389
back to cath sweet wanna be used for me
well its way to decrease peppermint

395
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:23,100
but the good thing is that we look

396
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,860
cases you can writer for this cut up
undercover you want

397
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,799
pregnant by is prior to launch
pre-screen a nifty competitor

398
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,679
it when just braque their I mean yes my
liking

399
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,379
and that a.m. or maybe stopping the run
did and the dedicated gap into the

400
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,870
frisking the fence over into Catholic
High

401
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:48,029
won't have anything to do with anything
also a bit wet puss have not hearing

402
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,779
even if they can meet him nd think it

403
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:57,370
synchronization tumors been refreshed is
rocking so obviously this sequence where

404
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,789
here recouping is that is what you want
it new

405
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:04,870
fr or multiplication advert

406
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,600
between have to wait %um defenses to

407
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,750
23-year welcome okay no

408
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,110
I want you to think both ANOVA cave in

409
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,250
which Ian I have to cap bit also put his
faith

410
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,629
and each event if anything 21 account
hope

411
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:29,399
do you want two hundred but and and I
can happen

412
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,439
on some laptops well whether the did the

413
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,769
VGA connector is and any DDR cap

414
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,539
and I mean losing this case when you do
is not

415
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,789
day switch so that or education around

416
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,500
and most powerful cath which is the
dedicated cap

417
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,049
bet and but

418
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,149
first we don't know how to switch depew

419
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:57,658
a online and we've articulating

420
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,870
in Maida and a Canon

421
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,360
maybe when they have it I think very fun
so-what we want to have is a compromise

422
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,149
I think

423
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,428
I think we won't let is planned created
and when this day

424
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,049
will be and their under device

425
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:18,360
a connected to anything it's possible

426
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,750
so and I have to debate in hKN

427
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,340
we have we use wanna be a great gap they
will be over

428
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,918
to you staying and Exeter have
deferments but

429
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,940
if I want a to turned a

430
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,419
up screen when the application fifth

431
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,679
its on your cat I mean have to do
something so

432
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,809
be and we have to be indicted made a
competitor

433
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,918
Google was it that we have to after to
win on connexion

434
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,679
for eighth day in this bay a both in

435
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,700
a ones for Wednesday went for the event
when we connecting the

436
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,080
dedicated gap in one avram father
integrated gap

437
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,869
anyway and when knows a client went to
China

438
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:05,830
ice cream it'd have to do a quickie so

439
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,408
in not perfect but that adhesive to
launch

440
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:13,600
the okay and a good with Bay Area you
want you will

441
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,668
had the best peppermint with many
continue staying between

442
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,190
Exeter we've a link to and okay so

443
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,639
I we repeatedly the informa Ryan for eg
the right to

444
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:31,629
with american president I think be there
must have any that fit so could the

445
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:35,740
on the event and every the DX for a
device

446
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,629
the complete a buffer to the number for
even that into its event

447
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:43,869
okay and and linking and there is this
energy provide

448
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,939
invented a that plans our way that
indicate US ever

449
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,720
and obviously for the day have it's
important

450
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,619
to undeterred by we will end we don't
have

451
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:00,789
including the summer except have
probably left a

452
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,950
example I tell you that the pieces into
a fee to working there

453
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,600
x2 and we will I i mean when the nose
and

454
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,939
the client knows in 20 different device
and a complete a and at that

455
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,789
said to have intact you have better put
on the back then

456
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:21,090
wondered it with anything between
Yarmouth and it can be

457
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,928
we've been embedded computing detente
infantry

458
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:29,570
so right now what has been done so that
the the perfect NTP often think about

459
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,619
the

460
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,209
in in there so london ont how him

461
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,659
and I'm going to be a the party there
and with

462
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:42,980
soon right now you have to want to have
a specific command line and we think

463
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,279
it's come into happened in it

464
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,360
at the patches for for using their eye
primer in me that when the k20 life you

465
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,369
want to use the internet

466
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,769
idea but I get there it's fucking and

467
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:58,760
and also a cliff into we've written
content event very few you don't use

468
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,840
canned Shindong

469
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,490
when unneeded so you don't have to meet
many

470
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,960
what needs to be done Indian a fancy
their as I said it's a must-win tp2

471
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,629
that we need also to 100 that opinion
that it

472
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:18,369
once the American see the are coming I
think we will I didn't

473
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:21,449
pretty soon when also

474
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,260
instead of using their I primed to
indicate when she waz we want to use our

475
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,470
program

476
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,480
we don't want to to use creations also
idea you want

477
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,970
there's something the time I think we'd
I would say I want

478
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,159
promise program a way to use it the

479
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,220
debate device a pregnant but and

480
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,760
their icon hair which is already used to

481
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,129
in customize apartment is a big wreck
accounts for

482
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,449
it's about programs can use for that

483
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,470
song dying being some work on it the

484
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,519
not changed also some meaning
application after laying

485
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,779
on gym then even when the education like

486
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,049
VAFA I it to using an old women

487
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,369
interfaith me when they are there was no
air and

488
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:11,658
anti-nafta game and that's about it so
it has to be very thin it's not so much

489
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,379
for

490
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:19,049
and obviously the the the comp with
intel has to do something SP Setia

491
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:23,440
things to fun though do meeting defacing
to through different devices

492
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,629
but I think it will be very

493
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:29,760
no how we can work through expert on

494
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,299
finally fuel you know though it exelon

495
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,600
so the pizza in except the at

496
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,359
we connected to then competitor will
equivalent competitor

497
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,639
an its if there is that the new cans
that can happen

498
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:51,059
in and X went on we will send in the
first quickie

499
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:56,330
and your mom either and much we want to
use far GP acceleration

500
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,580
ether library event in the pins year

501
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,168
but and 100th extender because X

502
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:07,980
they can do some acceleration from
Perkins met when

503
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,080
and since it it but up engine bay
between don't have

504
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,189
specific specific edge if you cut pro

505
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,770
there for the castle it's going me that

506
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,190
n if you think I P we don't have

507
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,210
we need to see both ATP opening

508
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,379
lack it is supported with a right to be
good

509
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:30,918
we can already known and embedded
computing to undercut we won't

510
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,309
and inside would think that position we
went we went on to

511
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,940
cather other competitor so we can I
really have to pee opening

512
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,990
we both the party its and keep you from
being and have several do it did nixon

513
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,849
so what he wanted it to happen in one
detected loaded

514
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,668
for expanded okay bet

515
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:55,599
there is some prevents the their right
to demand for free from noon till you

516
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,149
see people that uses DNA

517
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,359
week China forbidden on when the north

518
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,490
so we have to support their I fee-only
far

519
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,840
each's came and there I freeware

520
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,959
abundance because the very different is

521
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,200
you don't get the device back you want
to at this effort to use in

522
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,950
you I here in already opened and

523
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,240
by this be done did a nice this over 70
can do what you eat once and use it

524
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,760
went analytical there a n there I free
that use

525
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,539
only their been and I think

526
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,609
which are supported are in the mood in I
think you made the right rear

527
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,289
you know Anthony riney it be there and
the thing for you

528
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:43,279
I think can be ready for print extension
some

529
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,369
so do you have any question

530
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:55,369
it them and if someone can give them
equal

531
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:02,570
provocation yes

532
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,678
yeah

533
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,679
okay

534
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,970
okay so the question is

535
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,960
voter that we make with day they have an
option

536
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,560
they can when remove we have to stay
connected to the friend who is in

537
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,040
we can and have a application on
Wednesday

538
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,179
they're going to the right if you but
when we move in East Bay

539
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,210
and notification is sent to their
applications we can change

540
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,909
%uh device so can we had her if you ask
about

541
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,810
when I was told there was an extension
patient 13 genetics

542
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,139
I'm not sure when we can say led to that
tradition but the

543
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,668
up engine is broken and he does too we
do everything from is that so it could

544
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:32,549
be used to

545
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,860
to do that that their I at ira third but

546
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,950
no application care but with that fool
okay

547
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,230
for receipt for the summer applications
of

548
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:49,230
yes

549
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,980
commitments in them

550
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,380
things that we would have to wear to to
do all the the work again to initialize

551
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,750
they

552
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,599
minutes before going in the client won
that battle so

553
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,030
the if it if that then in in jail

554
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,630
extension it could be I did the
eventually tomb

555
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,510
add to the down for Taco I don't know a

556
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:20,359
we can find a way with maybe later and
on the kitchen

557
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:27,359
here than that mean when you enter

558
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,070
thought your question is when you do the

559
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,670
a bit the copy from a table for two the
a number for

560
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,180
do you have enough information a to calm
down her dania

561
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,879
when we do the compy is a typical it

562
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,170
to avoid any it is a and listening to

563
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,380
retaining at directly unfortunately
mitnick me

564
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,540
this will be there St but for retaining
far

565
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,430
from her captor it said song anything is
possible

566
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,799
and forty we we need a copy for that

567
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,800
there is no other way other questions

568
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:40,080
non-chinese token

569
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:47,670
on

570
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,180
bop
