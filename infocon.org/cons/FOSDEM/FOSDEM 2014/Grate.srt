1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,969
was a mint

2
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:19,050
alright so

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,980
all the talking little bit about the
Tegra

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,810
mine

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,109
my and some other people's efforts to
try to understand the

6
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:34,149
thats intern working or other for berkes
author yes but is this

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,089
drivers so

8
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,239
personal to land but a bottle I am on

9
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,050
have about the twenty years graphics
programming experience to know those

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,540
here 7 Professional in

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,970
his work it's arm and thanks for an

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,740
at the mall a driver team making

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,860
the drivers that look care has been so
friendly to

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,240
try to pick apart a

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,330
and while doing that I was involved in
the development of the OpenGL ES 1.1 and

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,070
2.0

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,889
standards on lovers reasonably active

18
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,750
open source country reuther a mime

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,070
biggest portion of that miss

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,520
forgets but also the

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,770
casual pipe a

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,500
and I'm an active de Masi nurse thano
now so that its

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,140
and fortune no

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,940
because other they don't there's love
them a stronger

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,140
oh I have released a lot of DeMoss farm

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,320
is the work at our im

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,320
what my I'll sir

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,400
right so on missus title great I'll tell
me a little bit about

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,100
what greatest that's the nomogram for
terrazzo

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,070
probably didn't seem but and

31
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,889
it's a it's an effort to reverse
engineer the Jeep you

32
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,750
and eventually to create an open source
driver from it I it's probably the

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,770
furthest behind of all these

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,900
arm such a projects a

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,370
due to not very much time well

36
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,560
available for doing this but I

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,580
yeah will still give it a go ion

38
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,090
the usual everything here is based on
reverse engineering so

39
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,660
you know don't invest all their life
savings into something

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,900
based on something until you hear it's a
most information much

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,590
indeed be incorrect I

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,080
so I'll Tolbert abouts what has happened

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,140
so far um areas in the summer 4th 2012
Diana

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,660
I N heard about that Lima project and i
John there are

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,270
RC channel but it was so boring because
I'm and it into

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,739
did to my arm work so i cant touch their

47
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,260
stuff so instead I decided or

48
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,769
rather large commencement to start
looking at the Tehran I

49
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,670
and then so I'm just quietly backed away
and the

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,988
around for some last year I had well
implement and countless

51
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,410
months from a capturing

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,980
and parsing second pick it apart and see
a beautiful something

53
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,160
and I did some and the tools

54
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,350
the cheddar database arm reg is that a
vis

55
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,829
for on the some other

56
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,880
I say the says most will open the lists

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,920
numb center stage but its it's a bit
difficult because so love this getting

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,940
compiled into the shade or social I'm

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,150
I've had a very rough fragment shader
disassembler

60
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,959
a and I had the a

61
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,760
reverse engineer the proprietary
compiler a shared object interface I

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,160
can't

63
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,390
compile shares from my own programs

64
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,750
without using their driver a

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,180
and then I got bork bork its and

66
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,489
kinda fun stops working for a while

67
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,549
so I at that point or a

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,000
so a few months I think among players oh
I was told by

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,230
look that I had to get my ass onto

70
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,260
IRC because something some most so
almost doing something

71
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,969
and I was Terry and

72
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,800
and it turned out he had the not at all
been man

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,200
idling while I was procrastinating a

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,770
so he yen already I think been working
on the

75
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,580
on the mimics kernel drivers

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,979
he started packing together some my lip
DRM

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,539
interface for that and

78
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,550
the replayed come on streams and it has
known RDX driver

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,270
and a even did some work and volume

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,740
so for Massa I

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,849
and then yeah jerry has hired by ended
up

82
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,050
so I I'm

83
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,569
slowly trying to gonna follow up on my
own one is doing

84
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,719
a but bear in mind that my biggest
interest terrorist the reverse

85
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,498
engineering part not so much the driver
development part

86
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,919
because I've already it's that scratch

87
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,109
at our so them but I will

88
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,800
I will you know give it a go but they're

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,710
all summer terror and a more also mark
in the future has thrown in the green

90
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,878
t-shirt back

91
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,339
but they're and also I

92
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:55,659
should mention that Rob Clarke whose
that's doing the for drina project s

93
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,879
also had some

94
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,370
had a little bit of bleach at some other
some other stuff

95
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,610
so helped a little bit as well so

96
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,020
yeah the the current status as of now
the so this was

97
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,128
you know the year ago I am so yeah

98
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm basically I've been focusing on
Tegra 2

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,729
I

100
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:18,699
I'm Tegra 3 in for I will mention a
little bit about the

101
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,160
its now so we have an

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,710
months trend on things we can replay
that

103
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,719
and do some basic rendering rendering
been

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,250
tampering with a lot of states to could
have confirmed suspicions

105
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,150
so for us so we can with new you know
little bit of

106
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,510
souter a

107
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,639
down there some upstream Linux the arm
driver

108
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,889
and now it's even as of: think a

109
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,300
to three weeks ago or so it support for
the

110
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,300
for the 3d core downstream outlived I am
support

111
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,210
the blue thing cerrar links and my

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,000
I in the slides but I'll put them up
online

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
someone wants them meant a

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,910
and I we have a very very unfinished
masai Gollum

115
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,170
driver and can only do Jill clarren
Repik suspects

116
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,660
yeah its at least some basic stuff
working

117
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,370
that deals with no

118
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,880
telling him these kinds of things so the
Tegra 3

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
since just work it I don't

120
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,400
I don't really know this but thats I
haven't seen any real differences in the

121
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,489
and I come on stream so it looks like
that's just the same

122
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,350
Precor a figure for

123
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,710
has some more registers a with

124
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,120
found I'm some other

125
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't think it's strictly compatible
as and I think the first

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,540
amounts transferred it didn't replay
there but

127
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,940
there has been replayed a some months
trims

128
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,120
container for hardware so it seems to be

129
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,639
roughly roughly compatible

130
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,919
day one a you heard about those of you
who were in the last time the previous

131
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,419
talks

132
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,560
probably heard a little bit about that
its Kepler based

133
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,070
at its only has the Jeep you are the
three core from

134
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,159
Kepler a rest luv de force and

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
infrastructure since the been lacking
there so

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
I have not done any work guess down
focusing on the three coram

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,740
on the Tegra so that don't that's being
replaced

138
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,810
Anya this is something that will have to
deal with yes

139
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:44,810
what

140
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,000
let's discuss that later

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm be I I need to to work with the guys
and some things

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,329
a yeah

143
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,360
so I won't talk more anything more about
the the k-1

144
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,399
and the stock missus just

145
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,060
short summer

146
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,140
alright so it's just them all but
apparently we can't stop my

147
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm not so good at reading email so I
miss the detail i cant connect

148
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,340
HDMI equipment to the big screen

149
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,850
and mine them a platform doesn't have an
external monitor so

150
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,040
back and show you anything here either
Yemen

151
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,819
so I don't have a screen to show it on
either

152
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,980
so ap and turn

153
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,400
trims lies it's been less than us so I'm
sorry about that it wouldn't have been

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,110
too exciting it's just like a rotating

155
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,340
triangle with grown children so it's a
that's a

156
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,410
the protests were for a quick little hut
yep

157
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,620
so imagine that trying rotating I guess

158
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,610
at so I O I'll go a little bit into the

159
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,170
into the hardware I so

160
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,479
as Chaudhary author the Jeep use the

161
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,630
its them its codename they are 20 from
them

162
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,320
and missus them deeply

163
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,350
found some traces but deeply down and
some columns %uh via

164
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,890
a its animated mode runner

165
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,030
it consists of at least three components

166
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,240
I'll the graphics 2d and 3d

167
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,630
for and then there's also some kinda
video system a

168
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,710
and Calder decoder I don't really know
the spectra I

169
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,230
yeah but plans are programmed the so the

170
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,920
this could components a program through
something called host 1x

171
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,069
which is a DMA engine for on writing

172
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,560
registers the to the GP is a drives the

173
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,770
trust the Jeep you and

174
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,250
it has a proprietary OpenGL ES driver
which is useful for

175
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,029
version genera

176
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,319
I ass on the GR to the is that it's a
and

177
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:08,378
its public plan document on great so
this means that everything that's

178
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:11,629
needs to be doing in the deck striving
for instance

179
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,589
available 'em yeah and it's a sign up
the mic return

180
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,189
turn and disorder license agreement but
its it's not

181
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,050
very strict on a

182
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,449
they have source code available for on
for

183
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,339
doing some glitz and stuff like that a

184
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,480
it can do the a lot of different things
really and what's Phils

185
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
whether you know telling parents a
likened tiling

186
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,319
are linear nonlinearly addressed sources
are

187
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,399
surplus a again this

188
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,800
stretching rotating flipping but only
like turnin

189
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,258
other so most was 90 degrees rotation

190
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,439
a some fun blending

191
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:58,949
I and coverage sampling and a listing

192
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,519
resolve which is a but interesting I
think can do

193
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,579
up three was more so it can do basically

194
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:12,420
it's capable of doing all the all other
to day operations from jail second day

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,219
for blending and

196
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,759
or both would mask stance on asking him
with the

197
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,759
censoring all these things so yeah it's
quite capable I am

198
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,370
yeah the gr 3d is

199
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,430
I yeah

200
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,128
a bit different a it's a it's a non
unified shader

201
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,890
so the it has a separate partition
cheddar

202
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,260
and British and French enter ISA I am

203
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,020
and yeah it performs blending in the
fragment shader rather than fixed

204
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,560
function

205
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,359
sergeants which means that we need to
recompile the shaders

206
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,740
old-time a it all

207
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,710
only has a 16 that the floor for but it
seems to her for

208
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,650
added support for for 24 bits as well
with us

209
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,900
the 16 rent render targets including
that from San switches

210
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,000
quite a lot where support seclusion
curious

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,980
a quite a bit of the picturing features

212
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,000
although the they do have some kind of
Numb power of two

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,940
pictures which s not

214
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,770
so nice are other it it only supports

215
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,990
the well it supports that without
without permit perhaps

216
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,310
but also with the with met maps for them
if you run

217
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,660
achieve try to access outside of their
01 range than getting

218
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,010
undefined result so yeah

219
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,490
there some

220
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,680
separate extension file I

221
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,969
yeah the standard or derivatives

222
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,380
and the a a quite interesting I think
draw a path extension

223
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,700
which is for drawn to the graphics the
Berserker some

224
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,090
things like that I haven't really they'd
into that

225
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,930
but its to interesting feature so

226
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,609
it might be but bisous this feature
softer only from the

227
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,589
from the driver

228
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,619
rights there's a video product but I
haven't for tonight's

229
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:25,909
I'm not a video experts I'm not gonna
try that either

230
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,699
if anyone wants to have a look at it
feel free to

231
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:35,389
alright so I'm the vertex shader
instructions

232
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,949
instructions that is basically a subset
of Leandra 30

233
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,329
which is sana means that it can do for
component vectors

234
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,449
vectors for me normal ale you

235
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,529
instructions or single-component

236
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,420
a scaler as a view and sections and

237
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,410
it seems to be able to those in peril
although I don't

238
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,238
think I'm ever seen the compiler
generate that a

239
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:08,649
there it has no so the control flow so
loop since been rolled

240
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,850
I but its very straight forward to
generate conferred looks basically

241
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,879
exactly like to TJs I

242
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,220
so yeah %ah

243
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,819
and the there's already a back-end the
nine-man a false messiah

244
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,559
driver so probably to share some

245
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,629
code there

246
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,379
yeah the front and center ice I ISAs

247
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,029
quite a bit more interesting slash

248
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:43,609
crazy a so all the registers are

249
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,569
either what representing one 20 bit
floating point value

250
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:51,118
or to time but fixed point was that sir

251
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:54,730
2.86 the this point signed

252
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,040
on their

253
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,410
are at least three separate instruction
stream so there's

254
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,079
the the prohibition programs are not one

255
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,209
stream of instructions there there's
three different

256
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,858
at least I suspect there's five but
haven't

257
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:16,319
really figured out all details a

258
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,299
streams and the the their are some
additional comes

259
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:24,699
control streams that kind of the fine
how they get executed

260
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,699
are scheduled I'll with each other

261
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,179
so there's the yeah the alias trendy and
I'm

262
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,199
are manic much unit and there's the

263
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,378
multifunction units which just both
varying installation

264
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,509
and complete function evaluation

265
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:48,329
so dusa typically you know meant what
barings over the triangle

266
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,859
or and/or the

267
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,540
do sine cosine this handsome things I'm

268
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,059
and it seems that some those two are not

269
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,249
executed in the same clock which so

270
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:06,360
the instruction artists room for
encoding both kinds of instructions and

271
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,898
the same

272
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:10,958
then if word and now it seems there

273
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,409
securing the two different books I am

274
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,220
there's a texan units and then there
seems to be some kind of export units

275
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,600
for

276
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,149
writing the out the

277
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,330
caller to the Columba for and disbursed

278
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,639
some not one so I was just under and
share the spill registers

279
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,940
somewhere that mean even more stuff
starts the show up but I haven't

280
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,260
really a understood that party

281
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,740
and %um there's no control flow

282
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,980
whatsoever so olives group unrolled all
conditionals

283
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,910
don't become other a national selector
products

284
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,680
so the Baillieu 'em unit

285
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,250
its pretty well understood there's only
like the

286
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,350
the few bits that arms

287
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,800
there are so only a few bits that ives

288
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,680
I see pop-up let I don't not yet

289
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,780
Phil have a good understanding of what
means and instructions come in

290
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,970
packets a flower for I

291
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,820
64-bit words a which I there are

292
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,220
for scale operations a or

293
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,290
3 skiller for operations and the

294
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,440
up to up to 4 a.m. but it comes so

295
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,750
that either you know either

296
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,960
to twenty-fifths floats or are

297
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
now forces time but

298
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,700
3.5 hours

299
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,670
and the other estimate is basically a
glorified Madden

300
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,740
can do a this

301
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,280
at one this nation for resource our
brands missus so this is

302
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,460
llame an example for for that visit the
mad instruction and have some bits to

303
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,090
choose

304
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,699
a some of the different modes for it
squares thing

305
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,300
component before doing it are at change
the order of

306
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,340
adding so it can all plan for it out
some

307
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,220
these kinds of things I'm are before bus

308
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,320
and is also has to say but that since
the

309
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,428
seems to mean that accumulates the
result so

310
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,559
a the this nation register just come ads

311
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:34,760
to it a and when it does I did use a
some kind of special

312
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,900
accumulation registered since and its
also house

313
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,820
min max international Select and I think
as a minor stunning

314
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,070
so far as that when induced if you
change the man's to

315
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,350
men is still get the the sea stuff so

316
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,110
still tries to add Singh so it

317
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:01,110
so quite just just postero i'm for
scenes that

318
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,640
so slight problem yeah

319
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,950
and all the although I daily inspections
have a

320
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,610
predicaments so so there are some
condition register that

321
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,330
that gets sucked Amanda

322
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,428
that connects to execute conditionally
this summer

323
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,690
yeah the results can separate the

324
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,910
source Branston absolute on negates the

325
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,370
that's right seems to have some are

326
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,409
under him but I transit them a

327
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,000
the multi-function units this problem
based on this paper

328
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,790
call the high-performance RF Ishan
multiple fresh mint litter

329
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,928
which is some and media research paper
100

330
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,160
propose the idea for merging the firing
and the

331
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,510
and the complex function about your 21

332
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,879
so the complex functional inner part is
pretty much a mister thats

333
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,060
very simple just takes a register and

334
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,840
and in and writes that this nation %uh
the result

335
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,240
the same register as the source and it
does

336
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,370
police operations I'm and to people and
they just I'll there sir

337
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,709
two-step I train and also

338
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,780
the the exponential function

339
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,790
so I haven't the

340
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,800
started what the intermediate result is
but it doesn't Center

341
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,470
doesn't seem to require an extra extra
values

342
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,590
or anything like that so it might be
bring reject range reduction are

343
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,240
something other

344
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,740
and

345
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,260
to and but the Merengue right to still a
minute mister s

346
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,540
a see where by see which varying at and
blitzen image

347
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,050
instruction right camp Fig figure out
which register it

348
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,230
rights to and the I've had

349
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,380
had some friends look at this rope
Larkhall

350
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,460
also her look at them stuff haven't been
able to figure it out

351
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,000
some mister so yeah was for someone else

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,930
wants to have a look at them that would
be also yeah

353
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,870
leave texturing construction is so
somewhat no understood its

354
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,600
it seems thing coating is rather simple
it's not entirely clear

355
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,810
how it passes the picture for not a

356
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,350
that's not so much that's a it's a
mystery but

357
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,320
more that's you know I haven't really
felt like working

358
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,110
too much I'm not a without getting the
firings working because

359
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,280
looking up the same the same

360
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,540
a fish apartment for an entire triangle
is

361
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,590
extreme little line Tristan its

362
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,090
foreign that but it seems simple

363
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,510
a both lookups have to thank you maps
the

364
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,920
compoz onto the exact same binary code
so

365
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,160
it seems the the the harbour deals with
all the

366
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,460
all the stuff for so now

367
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,950
well there's no need to France's
normalize the kidnapping but just saw my

368
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,620
Zeiss

369
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,459
require

370
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,559
and then there's the export an ass and
section but I'm

371
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,830
a fun which which

372
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,928
runs are you its it rights to butts the
rest is just

373
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,370
looks like garbage to me surprise so I'm
now

374
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,350
I'm not really to spit on that other

375
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,879
yep so as you guys problems and the

376
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,900
this is rough stuff from and to help the
stuff on the one in

377
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,580
a there are some things that needs to be
done

378
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,300
I saw this is just implementation
working mothers

379
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,350
this this song versions nearing

380
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,570
so that we have a bunch live DRM patches
that

381
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,750
should be upstream a

382
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,610
and yeah finishing out the

383
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,500
kinda for the details a

384
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,890
we should probably have an ex RDX driver
finished their

385
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,180
is a stub driver but it doesn't do
anything

386
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,330
with the have except from mode setting a
yes

387
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,980
so

388
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,020
doesn't accelerate and an amp drawing

389
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,400
a yeah and so that's

390
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,780
this is the GR for an answer out into
this pretty much

391
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,050
document its it should be pretty he said

392
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,290
do also and we have a working with
diadem interface so

393
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,700
so it's made mostly kind of knowing
really how

394
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,390
the GDX interface works I think you're
gorgeous the biggest

395
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,900
I don't know the ex the but the deck
stuff but also

396
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,360
from it would be quite a bit of reading
code to

397
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,469
understand what min saddam yeah

398
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,680
a member's servers and learn the Bering
rights

399
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,240
are as I said still a mystery the said
that Prime genetics

400
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,250
a exporting and then there's registers
billing which happens

401
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,590
the happens if it didn't use registers

402
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:12,080
and they also sent to trigger the same
kind of could pass if you use

403
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,600
more than more than

404
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,719
32 uniforms because there's only

405
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,740
the non-uniform afloat co-processor

406
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,380
and there's some weird stuff there I
don't really see where the

407
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,720
the extra uniforms that some to the
harbor at all but its

408
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,050
dust work in this does give the right
result so so it's a little strange

409
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,450
so maybe maybe there's something wrong
with my come on stream stuff air

410
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,210
yeah yeah and there's the

411
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,660
MSI column driver and thats huge

412
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,700
huge bitch his work and its

413
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,380
probably going to go on for years so I
am

414
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:01,380
that's pretty much mine talk there some
questions

415
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:18,740
a

416
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,580
you a helped others the

417
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,879
a olds and BDS the with which never
drives

418
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,360
that so Tecra and Kepler heavily all
relate them

419
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,760
it's in a booth at the Karachi its

420
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,780
developing notation

421
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,389
terrorists apart from the vertex shader
being now

422
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,600
being mami 30 basically the vet said
that is based on the

423
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,659
open should I say so it's yeah

424
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,960
that millions those even them the bit
fields are exactly the same

425
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,150
yeah so it's the so it's

426
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,870
the Events section and I'm pretty sure
they're just both a llama conover

427
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,639
chatter

428
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,230
stirred and cat was the desktop
technology not related to

429
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,270
Accra yet what they do to go out the

430
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,639
who pick up the k-1 is just cover letter
but seat has nothing to do with the old

431
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,150
Cup

432
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,890
the ought to go yeah I should probably
start using AR

433
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,490
they are 20 rather than to grow because
it's a

434
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,600
tigress a product lineups energy field
line damn marketing people

435
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,600
yeah his

436
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,890
I'll admit I haven't been keeping up to
date with

437
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,370
a I went and read it does and does not
release i think im

438
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,709
on the new beau Saif a starter slowly
share or

439
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,029
act your start work with the community I
thought it was in the impression that I

440
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:49,010
was reading that

441
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,220
Tegra was I am more open source in any
of their other

442
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,559
work had their phones are far so for Jah
Cure biggest only thing that is not

443
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,830
to open source in there src so a

444
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,470
the Tegra Tiger has great support in the

445
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,539
in the kernel the can work this the

446
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:10,970
that they did they do excellent work and
and

447
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,090
support first purely users as missing
right now

448
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,220
uses base dismissing and a

449
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,800
and I'm I'm talking a bit to sum it up
people and

450
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,899
and there that trying to get some
agreement to get some

451
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,100
information out the I don't think
there's any chance that they will open

452
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,689
up their drivers are

453
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:36,690
are the documentations and other
questions

454
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,969
use it the most job board with the
project view with the

455
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,120
reverse engineering part working on the

456
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,320
chips kitty just ago

457
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,409
through you'll work blown a tool to use
that part of the project

458
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,840
sure yeah the I should've spoke a bit
about that I guess

459
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,330
a we haven't we have a bunch of the
tools a

460
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,070
knots and where a sophisticated us the
foster for

461
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,620
or anything like that but the we do have
a an repository

462
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,699
called great time to come under the the

463
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,270
under the I was a call organization

464
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,280
great dash driver a that contains

465
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,930
a some my british chick into

466
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,520
open jail programs Lincoln LD preload
and it will dump out the workman streams

467
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,730
that are sent to the

468
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,480
for the crime or I am missiles from that

469
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,690
the we have a had

470
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,900
disassembler for the merger some
fragment shaders

471
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,090
a so

472
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,370
that but actually takes GLS also risk

473
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,419
source code compiles and whether on
tired compile and dumps out

474
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,410
the disassembler towards like the
compilers a bit crazy because it are

475
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,020
mcrae someone untraditional in the way
that its out but

476
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,070
its binary is actually a command lists
buddy a cement

477
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,909
to the to the

478
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,710
hard for her to the campus so it's not

479
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,980
it's not just the instruction streams
its you actually gets

480
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,200
the whole thing to up a

481
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,450
yeah there's some other I have the

482
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,740
I have think into bed and some stuff
with the with them the tools

483
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,160
have some documentation for register
that's their

484
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,610
I am planning to some but up streams at
some point

485
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,050
cuz I've I've also added some personal
to them the tools for instance

486
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,330
reading planets floating-point yeah I

487
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,830
so that so I

488
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,620
now that i think thats pretty much it
for the tooling

489
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,209
terrier Moran thing important now

490
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,340
yes oh and I'm

491
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,399
the workflow is basically writing small
open delia's program sumber

492
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,480
looking at what they're what they're
doing a

493
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,690
what the output is how it changes when I
change the

494
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:19,179
sequence of commands I

495
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,250
am could you go into a slight bit more
detailed up what exactly

496
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,350
the upstream looks like like for
instance this exhorted the X Drive with

497
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,820
that you have on the to do this

498
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,340
that the except 86 with you printer from
Chile that

499
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,280
like brahmin for over a year or yeah
development happening in other places

500
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,670
now

501
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,450
now yes %uh there's nothing has happened
although the next driver ass and sister

502
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,010
terrorists working hours

503
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,690
sensei gets hired by Amadeus and so high
that

504
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,809
their arm there has been a little bit
talk from Invidia

505
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,080
about put the possible to have open
sourcing their

506
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,330
existing Tegra driver so that might
happen

507
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,649
but that I wouldn't have my hopes too
high fly either now

508
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,190
and what about the %um how does that
relate to like

509
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,200
the could have great project yes 0
there's

510
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,570
to this current the two different they
had lived their arms for

511
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,860
for Tehran one that is some in 10 by
someone that

512
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,909
MIDEM for and for the kernel from
contesting the cum

513
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,520
and then there's other one which is men
$10 by all the guides had me they are

514
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,600
other

515
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,418
Terry and I i think I'm the one doing
the most things muscle maps

516
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,540
now so there's what the one under the
great product project which

517
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,649
I think is a cleaner approach to it

518
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,340
the the

519
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,649
and the other one has said high-level
API that this

520
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:49,139
little bit too high level I think tablet

521
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,669
same I have some in there in the

522
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:57,120
in the repository there some tests for
doing some blitz and stuff like that

523
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,049
with them

524
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:02,539
with the to the unit so some functions
from

525
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:06,270
injecting the right stuff so I think get
I think the

526
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,970
the the deck stuff for someone who knows
but driver should be fairly

527
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,010
ezer I mean to the extend for you now
writing and so for Cesar

528
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,720
it's a a its

529
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,779
a its old known problems really and

530
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,890
are is that that crosses like waiting on
certain design decisions that are in

531
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,940
packed I'm waiting on the rivers and
some

532
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,260
is open which is to complete with mister
something where people can actually help

533
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:35,620
our

534
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,658
or where you are but you have like a
time frame when you can

535
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,309
you're done know when it might be
available and Nana this this and there's

536
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:42,710
no

537
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,120
kind of project management at all there
sir just some

538
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,309
repose and some code and the a

539
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,529
a so if someone wants to pick something
up from they're free to that a

540
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:56,370
I would appreciate if they'd let me know
that they're they're working on it so

541
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:56,928
I'm not

542
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,630
spending time on or something but apart
from that so the

543
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,760
yeah and there's basically me and a

544
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,760
other specimen just me doing something
right now

545
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,750
right but seems to fit thank you

546
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,219
%ah
