21
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,579
I work in an awful team has a few other
people were kind of tools in room

summer

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,859
anyway I'm here to talk about making out
on this

25
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,350
for the developer tools I am

26
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,900
and the history in this is that the
jetpack team

27
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,639
with the team that worked on on jet pack
which is the

28
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,150
also knows that honesty K and that team
is now part a developer tools

29
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,060
organization we're very excited about

30
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,380
II getting web developers to make

31
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,680
and extend their own web development
tools with developer tools

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
infrastructure

33
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,150
XP cool and I'm sure to tell you through
them

34
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,220
current state if it were to be working
hard this year on me

35
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,450
much nicer so apologies

36
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,328
I i right here on Thursday evening from
Vancouver BC which nine time zones away

37
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,799
some little jet-lagged

38
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,130
I if you've ever travel nine time zones
you know that 4 p.m. is the absolute

39
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,638
worst time

40
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,069
anything morning thinking so if there's
a long awkward pause its just cuz I'm

41
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,720
rebooting

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
so I don't know if you can see this but

43
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,190
to as the old inception mean psych

44
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,930
awesome making of it also runs like no
or making out is for developer tools

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,409
like and I tweeted this the other day
and I

46
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,780
Masab like no no we're making out
developer tools for add-ons to and

47
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,270
that's actually more like her to making
dev tools for creating

48
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,270
dev tools out on screen out of her depth
without and and that'll hopefully more

49
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,800
clear

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,570
I by then the talk the current stay is

51
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,340
I nope got an experimental Dental's FBI

52
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,669
I am it's been around for a while I was
originally created by Pollard chance

53
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,810
wanna members the team

54
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,080
and Paul hacked on like the first really
good

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,690
dept was out on the ice officials called
JS terms and reuse Chesterman the

56
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,650
Firefox terminal

57
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,880
Sekai nice replacement for the console
with

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,690
completion in CoffeeScript support if
you're into that I am

59
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,860
several interesting add-ons a gesture of
course

60
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,969
look at grackles a time contributor in
house and he made

61
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:25,340
a really useful tool for the team this
is where it gets really inception you

62
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,030
made it

63
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,080
think on the RTP monitor which allows
you to inspects

64
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,400
ruled by King protocol packages that the

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,440
dev tools uses to I am

66
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,599
in fisher's so it's it's for the dental
stay

67
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,400
I don't know why you would use otherwise
I'm

68
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,460
the other big one is

69
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,330
actually and have yet there ago on

70
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,159
the one that's gotten a little bit of
attention lately as is anybody ever used

71
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,860
a prima called member dat ass

72
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,330
Hansen enemy her to bits one of those

73
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,639
things people use to make sites arm

74
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,349
such as partners angler but that's cool
so the guys that made them burned in a

75
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,190
Chrome extension for Amber JS

76
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,659
and he really interesting thing when
they basically made it doesn't emerge

77
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,870
ass application

78
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,830
and and Luca from came along in

79
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,099
hacked out a Firefox a out on a stick a
port a bit in like was an afternoon

80
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,839
I think something like that and %uh so
we had ever inspector for both

81
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,860
Firefox and chroma explain a bit how
that cross browser

82
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,839
extension works and also I i'm italian
phrase in the room

83
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,130
I think with their and he's been acting
on our really cool project called

84
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,649
the my site which allows you to use the
dev tools to make modifications to a

85
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,419
page in an export it as an out on

86
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,969
bit experimental but if you go to all
share the

87
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,490
the link to these lines later and
there's a link in here to get hungry

88
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,729
people for that extension

89
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,200
I was probably more I'm probably
forgetting some but

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,450
anyway so the existing tools I had to
get you started

91
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:09,070
I'm are there some out on developers in
the room like

92
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,000
credit out on and who here is like
familiar with like making I

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,279
a traditional certain visual restart
miss out on pets trapped on JS in

94
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,279
just happen to old-school I'm so

95
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,390
Victor por of I created this

96
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,260
I great template as toast and get help
in its just

97
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,610
it's got all the on to be strapped up
for you need you can you start writing

98
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,820
code with that

99
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,919
and I its kinda basic tool box that you
can use

100
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,070
and you just build your out on from
there

101
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,919
but got sir Nov hymns to the Dept of
Parliament to get you going

102
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,120
you can even usual you want for the UI
the dev tools to watch for

103
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,630
so there's a good have Rico and in the
add-on SDK

104
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,580
take a jetpack me I'm you know those two
examples I mention number inspector in

105
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,950
RTP monitor

106
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,659
I you can use all the rest of the the
out on a stick a models as well

107
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,709
and the other thing that

108
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:13,440
looking ended up creating when he was
working under inspector stuff was

109
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,789
I a grunt task for creating

110
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,820
Firefox add-ons so the way that the
Chrome extension works

111
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,860
well with the weather the amber
extension works is that it's

112
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,110
I uses drugs which is a node.js baser
dove

113
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,880
II build system essentially for
preprocessing things and doing it and

114
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,809
doing that he can be used for running
any task and so

115
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,109
I looking at a really nice I

116
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,589
grant asked that will set up the add-on
SDK for you and get it running and you

117
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,600
don't really have to do anything except
when a few commands

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,060
I'm and integrates into the rest to the
ground

119
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,560
build system is used for the amber
inspector project so that

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,649
when I'm people working on that project

121
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,920
need to build add-ons for Firefox or
Chrome they're just running some node.js

122
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,640
commands on the command line or not
having to worry about one browser the

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
other that much

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,589
so

125
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:16,290
and it's it's really like it's a bit of
a complicated project but Amber JS

126
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,890
extension is a is really interesting
project to look at that

127
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,189
in with Donna so

128
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,870
I we've got a lot of stuff in last year
in Firefox

129
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,089
developer tools for Firefox developers

130
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:34,220
I am and the latest iteration of this we
had a and how to process

131
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,050
browser to bugger and recently when
supports the entire

132
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,620
a process browser tool box in this lets
you

133
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,920
from basically debugging any code is
running in Firefox

134
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,579
including extensions from this separate
process and all

135
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,130
gonna pop out here in do a demo that and
see fit

136
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,790
hopefully works and so it kinda
interesting what does

137
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,380
actually start a different instance in
any

138
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,490
this warning will ask your permission

139
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,610
anyway and this is what it looks like
and

140
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,940
miss avital like dark thing but anyway

141
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,570
ass up for going to the bunker

142
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,570
is that for me not to yes

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,330
I think

144
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,330
victims do

145
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,010
so this is an add-on that as

146
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,090
a button

147
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,330
this by in

148
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:36,330
when you hit the button something
supposed to happen

149
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,529
but it doesn't

150
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,039
don't know why

151
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,129
or is that a fake it and showing what
you would do so this is the code for

152
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:50,729
that on

153
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:55,129
in the browser to locks and for example
you can just

154
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,209
set a breakpoint there and it would work

155
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,598
and if you get back code in your in your
out on UN

156
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:05,229
stopper that break point in you can do
things like inspect a local scope in

157
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,799
normal step to Bangor you also have

158
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,098
a scratchpad directly hooked up and with
the scratch can work something to ponder

159
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,019
is that if you're stuck on a break point

160
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:19,549
and you're in the current scope than the
scope on that scratch pad and also the

161
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,319
console

162
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,789
is is where you at the moment as the
local scope and blogger

163
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:27,559
that can be really useful for trying to
figure out a beard about

164
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,598
and has something to do with the below
Costco a function here and

165
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,459
you can get inspected and run arbitrary
cut from there so it's really quite

166
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,549
powerful system

167
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,269
it's a bit heavyweight that actually
loads all the job script in

168
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,659
from the browser so but that's that's
kinda what we currently have in its

169
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,220
actually

170
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,220
a lot of people like it for out on
development so so in the future we want

171
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,819
to make this little bit better

172
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,159
I'm better debugging simply the packing
packaging

173
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,199
and battery guys better debugging

174
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,799
that means that well we actually got
like i an intern last year he wrote

175
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,300
a

176
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,760
me a bunch of infrastructure code allows
us to have what we call dad owned a

177
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,810
bugger so it's a bit

178
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,599
different than the browser to bugger
because it only loads the

179
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,330
the code for your specific out on you
could click on the button in

180
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,690
the add-on manager and you would open a
toolbox is only focused on your code

181
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,730
for your out on its a very good
experience for

182
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,269
II add-on developers you don't have to
worry about looking at all the

183
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:37,350
JavaScript code

184
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,839
floated in from for all the browser so

185
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,750
I am we're working on a thing called

186
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,149
we can call it native jetpacks I'm

187
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,670
and the idea is that II

188
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,290
out on a sticky based on czar
essentially

189
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,660
arm pretty simple

190
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,370
and and what we've done in the past
we've bolted on a lot of extra stuff

191
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,100
around it like an install RTF file in a
bizarre

192
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,279
js file and a bunch of other weird stuff

193
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,300
answered it created an XP I had a bit
but what we're doing instead is we're

194
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,209
putting making someone changes the
add-on manager so it'll just directly

195
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:18,859
load

196
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,920
a jetpack out on without any other extra
stuff what that means is that

197
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,610
what you ship as a package of an add-on
is just a directory

198
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,970
as a file with the pack subjects on in
it and he just isn't that a

199
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,380
up that directory in order Firefox order
for you but more importantly when you're

200
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,500
doing your development

201
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,750
you can point it out a folder with the
Packers Jason on

202
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,079
and just hack on the code in that folder
and reloaded

203
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,689
you don't have to make an extra zip file
go through built up or anything like

204
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,170
that

205
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,300
so arm a limit it's just a lot more like
Roman people seem to like that

206
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,300
development so we're going to do that as
well yeah there's feedback i'm i'm not

207
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,820
gonna

208
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,240
debug audio system at this point it's
like

209
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,970
a little tiny bit and

210
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,300
we don't have a loud squeal we did that

211
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,810
driving me nuts okay

212
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,140
no really quite know what to do about
this point

213
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:26,140
um there is a proposal for the I'll get
loaded

214
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,819
I am missus native Jeff back support

215
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,800
plenty from the slides you're really
interested to dig into this on

216
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,120
this document was written by Eric
Baldwin a jetpack team members

217
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,660
and we do everything I get home even my
car

218
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,339
are change proposals so and you see the

219
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,540
the acronym Jap thats jetpack
enhancement proposal we

220
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,599
we have this process for making changes
the API

221
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,190
arm so that

222
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,279
pretty cool stuff we're really excited
about it and be landing

223
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,769
probably in 30 on 30 is just starting
like

224
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,190
next week through a lot of time and most
the work is done so I'm

225
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:18,190
I'm pretty confident in that Firefox
third

226
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,219
sorry gotten so used to like the

227
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,380
sorta like I don't even think about beta
and release

228
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,070
anymore I just think about 90 because

229
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,500
a lot a web developer newsnight me or a
Nats

230
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,449
that sort of my my shipping version and
when I just see numbers like that

231
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:42,439
it's usually a Firefox version number so
sorry for that

232
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,110
so

233
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,180
the other thing that we're gonna spend
like a picture New Year

234
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,750
putting together is better API's to make
a really simple to make a deft or

235
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,279
attention-seeking concentrated just on
their functionality not have to worry

236
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,670
about a lot of the extra stuff

237
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorting use jet pack style.com JS
modules

238
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,309
angry make sure that simple things are
sent on here some examples a

239
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,490
and what a panel would look like on

240
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,589
as part of a so Araceli Gonzalez millie
is the

241
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,809
the tech-rich the jetpack team he's
working on this back and

242
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,549
a working prototype as we speak I'm

243
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,309
so it's pretty simple and you that the
key part of this is that it's very much

244
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,918
like other Japanese KPIs

245
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,100
and that the UI that you would put into
arm

246
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,168
the the frame that's in the toolbox

247
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:41,169
is additional javascript and css and all
the communications and

248
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,440
by a post message: and so in particular

249
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,090
you look at the I call back to you we
get say you got a message from your

250
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,300
your frame and in the day in a depth of
pain

251
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,428
and it comes and your main like out on
code you get a call back

252
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,280
with I you know that source frame as a
room as an argument

253
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,879
you get some data from it you get the
origin events they could probably do

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,820
cross message

255
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,470
you know cross origin postmaster stuff
and you'd also get a thing called a

256
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,340
target misses the really important part

257
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,580
when ukrainian deaf to law the bar

258
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,770
the whole lot opens and what you're
really concerned about his stuff

259
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,020
in the page right and so you have

260
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,200
your UI down there and you wanna do
interesting things

261
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,690
and an past messages back to the Y

262
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,200
but it's all about the patient
developers working on and so the target

263
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,679
is a reference a channel to that page so

264
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,700
in the same spot near constant center
doing some sort of weird

265
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,760
round-robin post message: I

266
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,230
certain rodeo you have everything you
need in that call back

267
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,230
to to do what you're going to do I'm
just gonna do a little bit

268
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,710
up a demo member inspector show you
what's possible I am

269
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,240
at the the really interesting thing to
to point out about

270
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,390
amber inspectors it was made by the
amber jst

271
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,700
wasn't made by Firefox add-on hackers

272
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,230
look up or did it but it didn't take a
lot of time and they made some really

273
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,730
smart

274
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,679
architecture decisions about this
because they wanted

275
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,320
I an extension could be maintained and
improved by their community

276
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
not necessarily by our community arm

277
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,740
and that means the most to the code in
it is an ember GS whether

278
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I'll show you a what I mean so everybody
seen this

279
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:49,299
before goal to do NBC so this is the
amber extension over here

280
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,390
and

281
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,630
so it's got a huge tree guy ropes

282
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,159
and it's got the data is being stored
and down

283
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:11,159
what you can do it you can just say you
know

284
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,580
I don't know why showing four times but
to

285
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,168
there it is I can add something else
like I

286
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:32,580
Aug you for those tunes

287
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,279
but all this

288
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,940
I'll miss you I am here below the
toolbar

289
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,720
is a an HTML ap has been in bed into
Firefox in a particular way

290
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,009
and this allows the energy of people to

291
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:53,330
continue to improve their tools as a as
a framer community

292
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,730
using a technology they're used to the
only have to worry about it being a

293
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,879
Firefox add-on

294
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,539
or chrome out on it's a as a web
developer tool maintain my web

295
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,379
developers for the web development stuff

296
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,369
and I think that's really important
thing is really important for the web

297
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,309
not to be beholden to

298
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,259
browser vendors to catch up to you
because I am

299
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,590
embers seems cool and angular seems cool
but I've been around the web too long

300
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,399
enough to

301
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,100
to seeing a lot of cool stuff come along
and then get replace

302
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,389
or overridden I there's these guys at

303
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:28,639
mazzola they were really big into tools
and script oculus ni

304
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,418
still have like a kinda chip on their
shoulder but jQuery

305
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,409
I was like so long ago nicely get over
it jQuery 1

306
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:40,169
but you know just the other day on
Hacker News Service

307
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,360
do you really need jQuery unique article
and it was really good it was like all

308
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,309
these things a check for does for you
but you don't really need them anymore

309
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,899
or maybe you do community so

310
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:56,719
difficult thing about this is that you
know you can turn it off and on

311
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,820
it shows up these are I don't show up
here

312
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,990
I just look like everything else I think
gesture broken now

313
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,450
anyway and many other things you can do

314
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,369
you conservative link things

315
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,908
so I think

316
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:24,909
click

317
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,929
it's pretty broken

318
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:36,229
is totally works like half-hour that is
totally just like my

319
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:41,139
my laptop a super jet lagged anyway

320
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:46,998
this post feel like an info pain that
shows up here and I think it's

321
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:53,999
I think it's like a little weirded out
baby by that resolution size but

322
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,910
anyway so that for them

323
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,190
something that's really interesting
important I

324
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,320
thing to look at a few thinking why it
does Frank

325
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,889
favorite web framework that I use
maintenance disclosure scripted a bunch

326
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,980

327
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,559
