1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,780
next all Stefan Meyer how to get it to
compile it for free

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,220
yeah so I'm going to talk with this
involves the

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,480
or something well actually just sent com

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,540
just simple into the distance that the

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,210
for some time because one of the big
problems we have this but they too few

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,330
people actually

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,139
book on the gym machines they use so and
salt

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,430
open source projects John want to be you
have to wait a few contributors

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,649
but the than the media only one person
may be

10
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:36,340
bones in third least two people in the
room who have been touching the shins

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,489
on but they have a2p

12
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,849
few people actually looking into how to
get all that kind of stuff fast

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,149
how to make it but they all kinda
platforms so

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,980
um I've been looking a bit into that and
what you can do about

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,470
and I've been looking into that using

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,050
a very simple small talk because the
team to implement and you can implement

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,190
it in all kinds of different variations

18
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,570
and there's actually a small talk they
have been using for teaching

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,259
so you from below you see a couple of
the university's

20
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,280
love you the and the main design
constraints the river

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,020
to have something really simple for
teaching to have something that's

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,229
really showing the concerts in the ideal

23
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,890
textbook way armpits to begin means it's
not very fast

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,700
and than they have a couple of into that
is implementing the

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,750
actually or and the fifth and
implementations and all that

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,740
the improvement some but as I said

27
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,030
one of the manger all bases the wall
saying

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,780
is believed them slow but it's easy to
teach

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,420
I'm as you can see you on to offer

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,990
no pretty common object and the
benchmarks originating from the small

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,690
vocal

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,710
with two awesome intense things over at
least the

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,479
you but they have been used for small so
J Williams Charles great

34
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,890
I thing and use the like I

35
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,890
explore Austin TX lower than dollar

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,449
john was a poor so those tuned and the
hundreds of many years been to

37
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,790
make dollop of and I wasn't long does
the

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,048
wall sconce keep officer so that the

39
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,099
but we want to support something
different you want us to believe that

40
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:20,670
the

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,779
that the perhaps everybody is a
community can change

42
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:28,069
in order to make certain things better
on

43
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,268
it has to be a simple the basement

44
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,629
to be in contention theater really was
booed in buttons and small the view from

45
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,239
it is

46
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,950
if you want people to be able to add new
loans got some

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,328
or basically replace the mechanism by
something like me

48
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,939
whose than you need people that actually
can change

49
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:53,209
those working conditions so month all
but of course he also wants I know

50
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,249
that studies that region the same
although it may be too

51
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:59,840
would be nice so the dream no
unfortunate but I'll

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,319
on is actually I the court was a machine

53
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,918
you so under the blue barely 20 cousins
lower

54
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,200
and on which words well this six times

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,010
sometimes little but at least not the I
on them

56
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,099
so that's not going to go

57
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,209
and ideally there's a I love those
someone to

58
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,959
so how do we get there at the moment

59
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,249
just in time compiling versus the that's
the we need just a few people doing that

60
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,790
so often just arcane magic

61
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,769
so there's one person team or in the
community doing that

62
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,590
he sees that the and got such a machine
that's basically a good

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,549
on us I look people though the guy
behind which is

64
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,019
and think that other communities like
cricket was those and

65
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,269
and then the other option is basically
to

66
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,389
well a big big of his own perception for
engineers

67
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,290
the Jolla Ave the I DM woohoo laying

68
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,489
same day that both the heart for
instance just have the engineering

69
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,430
returns to do

70
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,680
so that the nozzle solutions will be
sufficient

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,409
so that's the commitment to look to
signs

72
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,548
in offices and and mom

73
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,130
the important on Bangalore you see it to
your friends

74
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,440
some mother sites will be online daters

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,650
we can look that up are but that too
interesting options so

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,500
you might have heard of type II the use
the infrastructures in all this call

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,950
of heightened arm they have to me that
race in just income

78
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,030
and compile which is a very interesting
post and then they recently

79
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,020
arm Oracle Apps open source a project
called truffle

80
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,380
and though they have so optimizing into
that this

81
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,510
on-base on possibility the valuation

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,900
and the all tool chain on base and doll

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,109
are just in time compiling up to same to
do those kind of things

84
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,610
and I'm going to week looking to both so
what some

85
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,230
just to give you a brief impression
that's a simple small home has been

86
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,520
developed asleep around 2,000 from
moving all who's

87
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,799
at the University teaching arm pics base
in Texas

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,000
to make really simple to build the very
first important

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,870
and i think is the year okay permit the
superclass

90
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,210
as a primitive to get the class temple
remotely

91
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,299
home has the pointing quality primitive

92
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,490
and system in teacher ovens

93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,120
as additions obstruction and so on I

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,900
and then of course we have seems like
Williams and this is the

95
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,500
and thats very much a small position you
really have

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,040
polymorphic miss them on this and using
the

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,300
than that to balls to implement the

98
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,400
and if you look at it through class you
see

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,940
if to lose and actually implemented as
you would implement its very simple

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,130
straightforward

101
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,130
in an ideal a small the implementation

102
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,080
I just value law and in both cases just
in time

103
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,300
no so a very straightforward simple

104
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,650
on small though to be based on Tom

105
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,650
can't explain all that the lose miss

106
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,090
look it's a pictorial so it on the
Shopping Cart my

107
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,090
runs on both the pictorial keep the

108
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,390
bit more simple just six million

109
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,190
I think everybody can meet that he s
pose

110
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,630
can anybody not treat small

111
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,800
okay that so I

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,430
small though the first thing you notice
is the

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,140
rules hmm using you that's actually one

114
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,630
method invocation world for the message
sent and the the receiver

115
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,070
so the uptick in the June vote that this
you

116
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,760
the evasion is all that you know things

117
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,150
so the S&P person as a and

118
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,830
0 not and that's true than the value

119
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,370
law which this collusion on

120
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,210
and returns as ones' otherwise

121
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,430
be omitted be a lady at the lock and

122
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,520
go or just because me you going

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,870
for poor so nothing too fancy

124
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,330
arm maybe into concrete small talk maybe
you know

125
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,000
through this medium going to make my
thoughts oh yes and you go

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,070
I'm that I don't know

127
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,659
that they can shrink or movement flights
from

128
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,380
mom

129
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,290
I will I have to try to change the
resolution moms mom

130
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,360
is it going to be a big problem sorry
for him

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,580
me just roam long

132
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,250
thats let's do it nations him

133
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:05,250
no problem

134
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,609
new

135
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,520
that goes it

136
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,830
lung them ivory said that after that's
light S&M

137
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,800
and

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,780
so I movie is mom

139
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,088
so the US miss you want to implement and
took the

140
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,580
the classics thing to do is to bill to
set up by polls

141
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,450
and then spec machine arm to
interpreters bibles

142
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,630
so if they actually compiles a pictorial
to a very very simple but what's that

143
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,910
so in the simple cement small but I
think we need something like the sting

144
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,839
operations

145
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,149
some of them are like putting arguments
from the function

146
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,170
working on them doing the actual some
them

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,300
pushing lot and returning from

148
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,170
so imagine you thing although could be
executed

149
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,550
you compote I'll that's actually

150
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,920
the first thing we do if he and hope
that means that

151
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,860
pictorials for people who support on
this site and then the second operation

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,529
is the euro and the thereby you can now

153
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,670
to the message than used for the
comparison and that little

154
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,459
on our stay here so that the dome
details upon the composing birth

155
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,810
you lose all polls so very simple
separation

156
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,410
you suspect to busy people the first the
arguments with message send

157
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,040
the result so in other words you can
imagine

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,260
very much the same for preparedness and

159
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,209
you people to loss on spec and

160
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,649
youth and there is no and eventually

161
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,760
I through a the one which

162
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,279
losses although law or I'll

163
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,430
the actual pictorial boo and up on the
pulsing you

164
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,899
and that's something okay

165
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:15,899
let's try to make the recorder the p.m.

166
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:26,339
yeah

167
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,750
looking at him

168
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,530
okay

169
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,430
so

170
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,420
come

171
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,770
I basically told you know how to
interpret such as a by putting

172
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,050
and schism control program the
implementation of this

173
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,040
is also a foreigners wait for soviet

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,630
you and I kinda pipe and sometimes
because it's actually mourners

175
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,850
the of heightened at the time minted
home

176
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,990
and you see you yeah in with missus

177
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,330
you get the message you want one but the
you left the frame

178
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,510
that's business humans aren't and

179
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,000
will be the new you overall the bypolls

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,430
as long as the I quote or actually

181
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,839
as long as there is the return but so we
start

182
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,580
other than unified bold them to be those
dancing

183
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,779
these which over the backboard and some
but I think

184
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,830
I to do arm

185
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,910
young mothers that's very classic that's
not very fast and that's actually

186
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,079
moral issue with the same this 500

187
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,589
Times Los Angeles so

188
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,720
known here comes the immediate raising
of I think

189
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,800
or I of heightened play

190
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,969
arm that's what the piper people also
used to implement them

191
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,680
home many past heightened

192
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,540
Asian so the only difference at times
like this

193
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,170
you as the fell believe you

194
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,640
be on heightened perception that
specific might put new

195
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,730
you I can be you'll start

196
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,130
also with

197
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,320
praises on don't know many what moves

198
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,200
or thats that's an interesting point to
start to generate

199
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,510
made called so it on the

200
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,030
up I didn't notice and such a point
social much

201
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,730
phone calls for some time compiling the
certain

202
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,040
new has been executed again and again

203
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,360
them it can assume okay no

204
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,370
are beginning to really spend a bit of
time to

205
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,400
composite and who in the past made cool
and

206
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,500
generator or are yeah log on all things
asians to gym

207
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,650
home that's not always useful so that's
why we need

208
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,089
who people but that small as

209
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,990
what the me too so

210
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,839
on but does the facing them actually me
ball

211
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,079
let's look at all of our room sampling
so

212
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,890
what's happened now polls be executed um

213
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,180
we started using that method on the tape
in the

214
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,310
the first by cool so what that means
iffy on all and that's racing mode

215
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,479
the actually in what seems like gums

216
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,690
and branches and so on and instead com

217
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,370
really just reported important actions
on certain assumptions

218
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,600
and I just sort of functions so really
just recording

219
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,920
reading writing feels because thats
what's really interesting

220
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,150
the one that misses the actually need to
go to the method of treatment by Muslims

221
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,839
although

222
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,209
I yeah even more than

223
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,109
variable and then legal who the in the
city have

224
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,690
and we don't buy food and the I'm and
then others that

225
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,750
you're not really you reporting any kind

226
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,410
sums which is not happened yet this
bitch but the

227
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,870
he'd levy just because the actions but
we know no

228
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,060
the actually the first by mister welcome
push

229
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,410
argument the love now happens there's a
push

230
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,120
argument but home as expecting that

231
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,250
them and as you also might notice

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,190
we actually didn't moved on any kind of
method invocation

233
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,959
because it's on the Green Album really
just want to know

234
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,989
what was a complete action palm

235
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,200
and them here again you start as the

236
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,370
train get argument the legal timeframe

237
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,270
the argument Terry get the documents
value of their

238
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,959
and basic in all those operations song
when you want

239
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,119
to perform the push itself still need to
go to the frame

240
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,390
he gets the point of increases that
point the

241
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,920
the right suspect on the bed and get as
many more luv a

242
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,420
7 this the city good position that the
stickers and value

243
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,849
and not the actual exposure yeah I'm and
that you know

244
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,720
continue and imagine our game well whose

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,900
because the two Michael Bloomberg you
don't see

246
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,829
miss night I'll but the than the execute
the next five

247
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,610
and then that happens all over again
that mean the

248
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,470
yeah but he's very similar as the
principal broker and then you might

249
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,320
already is the

250
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,630
mike Beebe who quite a lot of stuff
again and again

251
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,910
and that's the actions that tracing um

252
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,300
me to place in particular as the love
been team

253
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,140
so if you for instance the closer at
that race in the sea

254
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,500
you at the beginning just existing that
the

255
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,740
by every you do at least twice and

256
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,150
at least for every by months of my life
to

257
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,339
I whose only execute the but missus or
typical execution president be much much

258
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:12,830
longer

259
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,330
so and then the other thing is you
existence that very

260
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,540
which should be happy summit on you as
well

261
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,990
and we can really just remove those
operations

262
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,089
because people that he and the number
available

263
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,339
already and thus really the same and

264
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,800
a simple demise a concealed and then the
C you know the same kind of stuff

265
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,010
and then again impeding the spectrometer

266
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,250
you can also I yeah ideally optimized

267
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,839
and the people who are on the up button
project

268
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,220
that's necessary we should be and
actually chill

269
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,870
that about 90 percent also young

270
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,400
operations and such in space can be on
average

271
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,150
eliminated so I think that those between
forty

272
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,160
and a 97 percent depending on the kind
of

273
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,569
binge month Iran to you maybe eliminate
all those abrasions

274
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,329
than them ideally you eat reached a peak
performance for specific problem

275
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,970
by using the paddle tracing company and
I think the success ok

276
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,730
but that project so for them so

277
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,349
but the that's only one to implement
republicans and

278
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,000
I had to explain your state machine and
talking to all the

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,510
and the clothes already been to but
Harry another his faithfulness and it

280
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,370
was also not very clear how to compile
actually that both

281
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,810
through by pulitzer people yeah I mean
yeah

282
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,710
representation or something this if you
would use a single father

283
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,780
probably will more look like 3 so it be
poss

284
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,240
that the the function than he had
through

285
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,540
polls as the main maslin really

286
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,360
and the receiver on the left and the the
arguments room

287
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,209
the first book on the second floor
lindsey Strutt

288
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,420
on the yeah actually implementing you
look at it for them

289
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,170
he was pretty straightforward as well
maybe even more simple

290
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,540
so if the imagine the head to you home

291
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,800
such little so buried in the cold
constand

292
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,860
you from and you can just implement that
on those

293
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,678
is he knows the people on love is making
the dispute on

294
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm very similar for

295
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,969
for reading a variable so to compile it
go the recent small dog is very simple

296
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,570
to know

297
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,990
at his position when variables p mom

298
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,660
so you can just the remember so the next
morning for the variable

299
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,890
and then just really you need other
variable

300
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,990
in in the so that that is to you

301
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,450
and executed miss the so that's really
very straightforward its

302
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,720
I would say you think those and thats
technician and mean you can't even look

303
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,929
at something more complex Ian McPherson

304
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,140
what's the message and doing you have
the receiver and maybe an argument

305
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,580
to hear from binary message sent what do
we do

306
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,699
molvi simply execute the receiver
expression

307
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,700
because the receivers going to know what
actually

308
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,919
yes and no who is known as the value and

309
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,080
the same the argument expression he also
just returned

310
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,059
and here I didn't have to impose the
explicitly I can actually just three

311
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,649
uses the government and

312
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,940
implementation language and Justin
Michael you

313
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,610
the feeder I'm in variable and so on and
don't have to sing in both the house

314
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:38,918
that

315
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,929
balloons and but you have to push
through it but I've

316
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,440
the slate and so on so implementing that
battle but the

317
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,700
seems to be much more natural and then
you can go

318
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,020
on go to the receiver can mom

319
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,330
to look at this is the leftover and
other than getting

320
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,689
that needs to be invoked and be just
went on

321
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,990
resulting so I think from my perspective
that seems to be

322
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,450
much more natural and simple way to
implement them totem

323
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,980
and that's the the trouble comes in home

324
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,060
so the are the people here actually came
up with an idea I'm

325
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,668
to optimize those kinda is the basis
that those

326
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,179
buying at the wrong time mom
specializing those a cities based on

327
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,500
what makes a little used bookstore so

328
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,760
taking that message sent one of the most
important thing

329
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,870
you to specialize for is absolutely

330
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,300
%uh looking up to receive the and

331
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,389
the massive you wouldn't believe and
books so especially in small though

332
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,460
value wall dynamically important Shane

333
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,750
I I'm the mess that also

334
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,090
Melissa corresponds to the selector %uh
that's pretty expensive buttons

335
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,510
so um I'm always getting

336
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,820
how that works you special-use
frankenstein

337
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,490
mom that he is really he has that the is
the

338
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,669
3 you and that's then specialized to

339
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,210
an execution plea on that has

340
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,440
very specific notes in there that really
does just perform

341
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,010
the minimal operations all goal to

342
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,560
fall that num so one thing you can see
you

343
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,710
in his on those on that variable re

344
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,350
for instance became leaving in teaching

345
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,790
on to avoid overhead of boxing on JB
emblems

346
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,540
home and that thats generic buy me some

347
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,300
converted into cash them there's a
problem externals

348
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
so the plastic is an external and then
he is actually

349
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,449
in in line double send because the often
you get much better performance

350
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,790
issued in mind the mess that because
then you can specialize in in the

351
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,330
calling on

352
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,699
and the well because sometimes you

353
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,560
you media polymorphic message sense home

354
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,340
that one thing national might not be
enough so you have actually

355
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,149
shame and so you can something like the
polymorphic in non-cash

356
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,050
which is don't possibly month yeah

357
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,950
to keep him from the bottom p.m. but
very important question for small talk

358
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,580
and he is really a tree structure or mom

359
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,668
at least No no i think is those three

360
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,960
on and of notes and you have a very high
level presentational

361
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,230
on that booths very nice and those I'm

362
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,179
think I get actually pretty fast and I
hope past

363
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,380
I'll the just a ploy is really what you
want

364
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,500
this on the results so

365
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,310
what I have to say at the moment home ya
pas

366
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,639
by someone's home stuff running on
purpose our partners and the facing

367
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,270
on I have the support of possibility
both one of the

368
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,590
I think guys who actually made it that
fast as you can see you

369
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,790
you've barely 30 percent slopes in Java

370
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,820
if you move the futon people's 20
percent smaller than Java

371
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,070
so used to look behind on

372
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,730
so on Richards beyond the fact that is
in fact that I'm

373
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,820
which is mortars or cool so just barely
slows

374
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,050
goes well I'll the troublesome you and
possibly still stumble into some bus

375
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,210
%um there on just recently

376
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,929
RZR actually simply fixed a couple
things for me

377
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,070
on bomb known locally two rooms

378
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,399
love most important features and small
book for the console structures

379
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,929
wasn't supporting although on the posted
love

380
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:49,010
got me compilation our problems

381
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,929
so I haven't been able to do that as
much and

382
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,330
it's also much more to them implement
years I'm

383
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,500
to the black box tool chain but this
thing

384
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,149
people so

385
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:08,239
not was a conclusion that person was can
be have maintainable designs and

386
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,710
implementations and claritin

387
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:17,070
to basically reach more people actually
maintaining that the dust and pollution

388
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,580
and I think the yes that's it's totally
possible so the

389
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,330
nice the creek so they have the size of
the me that's facing was so popular than

390
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,510
and but those that's a good foundation
for that stuff

391
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,649
I when it comes to both phones bomb

392
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:35,729
I would say at least it's plausible but

393
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,820
com both the PC and quickly that I think
it's also possible

394
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,460
is those both sings to reach what kind
Obama

395
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,760
and phone there is a leading I hope
that's leading

396
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,000
he and miss the bit of time to push
those kinda over the years and some of

397
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,740
them

398
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,990
and maybe the purpose machine since the
birth

399
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,740
hunting indians I hope people home

400
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,600
yeah so but that's one huge solutions

401
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,600
opening the other any questions

402
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,370
yes

403
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,110
this

404
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,178
us

405
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,130
miles

406
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,860
it eases whom this

407
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,260
passenger planes major

408
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,030
them

409
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,059
drawer

410
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,810
mind this yes

411
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,530
size

412
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,980
arms

413
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,170
I'm my probably depends on the your
pieces

414
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,980
if you you really just want to implement
the

415
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,280
very simple and purple for plans
estimates for the evening

416
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,950
this home screw its as the scripting
language

417
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,169
cash house wrong

418
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:10,040
also this

419
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,480
you

420
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,650
there a.m.

421
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,160
klein's to you prize

422
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,309
she's

423
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,110
say

424
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,860
yeah those persons being held at

425
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,070
cells money from me but on what kind of
infrastructure

426
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,299
you talkin bone so the whole so homes
real

427
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,340
is he looked at as the child seeing is a
very

428
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,459
nice and simple 8 p.m. on the panel %um

429
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,760
I think compass on that runs on Java

430
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,669
so you could kiss the they're open
source arm

431
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,789
page and looked into romance

432
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,120
there's not a lot of documentation
solutions to the problem

433
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,428
but there's like a simple language
implementation the chills a couple of

434
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,090
concerts

435
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,020
so you can try to look that up saloons
loll

436
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,899
on on parental the open to anything mom

437
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,209
an otherwise %uh you can also

438
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,299
easily implement on top of something
like four holes montauk assemblies

439
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,908
into the bottom that service pitfalls so

440
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,190
I just got a text book I ands

441
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,890
who device there I'm gonna implement in
a stint at the such

442
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,370
so I don't mean I don't know but with my

443
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,949
more so on those techniques you have
here early for performance and I don't

444
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,559
know that's a critical point

445
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,629
your teases if so lands on mars

446
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,399
same clients

447
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,979
arms this

448
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,169
this

449
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,330
I am than others 0

450
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,780
I'm

451
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,250
yeah is

452
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,480
I what to time constraints

453
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,950
I i would like you to take yourself off
line and talk later thank you very much

454
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:07,950
on

455
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,689
gloom

456
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,310
you

457
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,409
yeah

458
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,230
grueling site

459
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,530
yeah

460
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,399
owned

461
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,890
the balloon

462
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,730
on

463
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,760
good

464
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,230
you

465
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,730
polo

466
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,320
yes island

467
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,280
I problem

468
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,700
good news

469
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,250
going listened

470
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,560
good I'm a few fights

471
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,679
this

472
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,510
the age group to own option apologize
because the video with someone didn't

473
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,300
have anything

474
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,820
