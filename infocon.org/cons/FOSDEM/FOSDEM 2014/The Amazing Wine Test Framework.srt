1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,320
to welcome everyone to the wonderbra for
them

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,939
folks who are new I think a replacement
for the they had for

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,349
work %uh that they packed arm

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,549
and what we're gonna talk about on this
next

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:16,550
30 minutes or so or 25 minutes as the
wine

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,550
test framework where there's a couple
areas there

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,369
and I'm going to try to briefly overview
give an overview of the wine

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,430
test framework and these guys can make
fun of me cuz I might get it wrong

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,550
on I'll be entertaining for them so if
that works

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,809
arm and then I think press was gonna go
in more detail with

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,280
the new test pot and some other
situations there so

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,620
arm so very briefly for those of you who
don't know

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,980
wine has up a ferry rich and mature
setup unit tests for Windows

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,250
so there's a very powerful said oh I
don't know how many tests there are now

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,809
but it's thousands right

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,349
its yes every every Windows API

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,210
has a test that goes with it and in fact
we had had

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,180
um VMware uses the wine test framework
to verify

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,140
that their windows runs correctly so
it's how they prove the Windows VM is

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,960
running right is because the wind test
run to completion

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,000
it's a very powerful so does tools at

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,680
most commonly done by running just make
test or that other developers do it but

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,070
there is also a

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,130
Windows execute a bowl on that is
created

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,710
that you can download and you can run
that execute all runs a quick a social

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,070
the cola make test

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,399
and then upload its results to test

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,600
got one each dollar to show test at last
you dork first

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,048
arm yeah

30
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,829
at this is the holding up today you why
developers

31
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,960
and anyone else who wants to help is
where an atrocious shape right now

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,960
art testing whatsoever yet he didn't
want to show this page City

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,850
hey so it did last year there was a lot
of green on the board and we are

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,789
celebrating how much green there was
this is showing

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,129
damages were 10 percent failures on
white wire we feel it so badly

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,829
do you have any idea 6

37
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,170
guard

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,000
yeah but we all know where goes about

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,879
its you all a shirt

40
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,609
and that's all you know is your area so

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,640
in what's unfortunate is

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,518
is this is actually really this is
horrible you guys this is horrible cuz

43
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,660
we're on a path all green and now we've
like back slip what

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,660
but okay yes I don't know we need to IRA

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,670
limited get up yeah

46
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,679
yeah we didn't have that the make test
lecture alright with this is the great

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,780
guest lecture

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,459
okay stop white green next time we meet

49
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,760
so and actually in all seriousness for
any view that have laptops what are the

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,280
things we are hoping to do what we
traditionally due to weinhardt is

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,220
we will look at them a test at us and
then we will have a session or that such

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,120
a schedule for for this afternoon

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,290
we're all kinda look at some other
common tests and see if we can squeeze

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,230
somebody's out

55
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,659
so I i say that technology has moved on
and it used to be a one after their own

56
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,379
a laptop and that's no longer the case
which is interesting

57
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,048
I'll so get running mate test on your
tablet in your phone sorry

58
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,170
and that will be Carter

59
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,230
so for any who are new to wine on

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,470
can we go to the the it you can do
something very useful and

61
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,090
there's a simple executed well you can
download and if you have wine installed

62
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,530
it

63
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,530
get build a wind um you can download and
run this execute a beloved a lot about

64
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,129
the upload to the web page in a

65
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:57,609
generates great statistics for us on

66
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,920
but you're showing city dog is there
some green okay so you feel better about

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,700
this page

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,700
I'll its to just

69
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,400
aka that's not all that obvious there
was a better pay is

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,410
there's a better page this

71
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,490
yeah okay so the bottom a test that one
issue there are there's a link

72
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,070
but because of your screen how maybe we
should put it at the top

73
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,340
okay alright so there's another to do
who could take that to do

74
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,789
you do that under oath over

75
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,560
yeah just move this to the top so this
is a useful thing you can do and then

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,660
what after you run it

77
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,340
your results will appear and you can see
results and then you can even go in and

78
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,929
see

79
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,670
what areas that your developer you can
run make testing you can submit patches

80
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,480
and fix it

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,600
and that's a glorious thing to do and
arm

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,490
so I think that was the paul got what I
wanted to say around

83
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,960
though regular wine test framework

84
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,840
and I think we have a lot of talking
about the new wine test but

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,210
arm just and took brain that for people

86
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,210
we in addition to running all these
tests on latex

87
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,430
we now also Ron all these tests on
Windows

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,460
so we have a Windows QEMU we we had a
VMware

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,690
system for years and years and years
that was the test but

90
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,210
and unfortunately %uh the maintainer
that

91
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,260
passed away arm as a tragic about

92
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,510
that we've been shifting it to a QEMU
based

93
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,130
tests that some well we're running all
these tests actually on Windows

94
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,690
and in theory they should all be green
on Windows but then what's good about it

95
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,650
as a patch can't get into wine

96
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,250
a change to the task and get the wine
Eliza runs correctly on Windows or so

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,110
goes the theory

98
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,660
a to the line test pot is actually a
wind said a Windows VM's

99
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,900
that brought all these tests on Windows
and

100
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,010
unfortunately we're having problems with
the new want us but to the other thing

101
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,750
we need to exhort people to do is help
us get those tests fixed

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,770
and working that's where i turn it over
to you then decide

103
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,840
its

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,090
so yes just

105
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:28,090
worth us

106
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,680
was just

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,610
us

108
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,900
missed just

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,950
