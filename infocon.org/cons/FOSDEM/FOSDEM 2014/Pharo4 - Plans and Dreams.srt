yeah okay com okay make speaker are

75
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,830
muscle I L object the small all

squeaker from longtime hey long long
time ago

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,990
i seemed short coat with a stainless yes

78
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,510
you have okay so I'm i'm talking about.
object to small talk one on the tomb

79
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,580
and non a classic small talk

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,740
a.m. something to talk about today and

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,940
I'm let's my own company made objects
been around for a while I just recently

82
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,680
started

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,800
them with X Megan and Brian the startup
and I'm also attached to the house

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,340
Oakland Institute in Potsdam

85
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,210
during my PhD which is related to this
stuff so

86
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,510
a lot on my plate and and I really like
small talk

87
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,050
from but also really like see from
because it

88
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,550
get it lets me get stuff done at a lower
level so I really love check to see

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm so much that actually way back when
anybody remember the anti-gun

90
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,770
so I got my first amigo and on the first
thing I did as a

91
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,979
implemented a.m. check to see
preprocessor for it

92
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,000
arm and that was

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,800
a little over a quarter century ago
scary and I next came out and that

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,440
you know they did the job for me and I
it's it's now lost to history

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,590
Peter I'm this week's stuff he added

96
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,479
some we embark a lot a long time ago
when the first cup coffee I'm

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,810
which is also lost because it was a very
good I'm

98
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,620
and a the stuff that's going to still in
the image i think is a buscar generation

99
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,710
so that's sort of where I come from

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,680
and I'm

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,620
being an object to C programmer I'm its
it's a great language

102
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,260
but you know it does have limitations

103
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,020
%uh because originally was I'm really
meant as a stopgap measure for a first

104
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm

105
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,070
those situations we couldn't use small
talk and that's really kinda

106
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,780
changed a lot so a noob minimizes it
simplified

107
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,969
back down again on the other hand the
small talk never really caught on

108
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,480
me I'm I i wouldnt community for quite
some time but I could never really use

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,110
it for my

110
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,000
day-to-day work just kinda sad I'm so

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,040
it be nice if it be more practical

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,870
nothing I could actually use it for my
work the bomb

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,090
and finally I'm I always really been on
the lookout for something to make this

114
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,590
whole program thing

115
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,390
a lot better because quite frankly
programming sucks

116
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,860
my I mean really deal with all these
low-level

117
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,170
things and when are you getting I

118
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,480
and I mean I don't think you know this
is not going to be huge

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,590
should be a huge relief but I maybe we
can make it better

120
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,080
and so

121
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,390
my first thing is you know I'm let's
simplify objective-c

122
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,630
and and this is why I I'm

123
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,500
jesse has really grown over over over
time used to be justice system for

124
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,630
wrappings see function seen programs

125
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,170
in little small talk like properties but
we can become stop doing that we

126
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,220
actually using the object system

127
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,850
and as that it's not really very good
time you know

128
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,370
if you want to have an object number
that's and his number number with

129
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,710
in for well thats not me

130
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,180
square brackets now we think there's
been some additions

131
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,679
so we can say at 3 yeah at four

132
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,479
but again if you gonna do that a lot
that's just going to be

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,910
really that whereas now to use just
plain did you say that

134
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,280
that looks that's right now that's
that's actually okay

135
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,310
because promise we have to sin taxes two
languages jammed

136
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,930
together and no that's just not been a
good idea

137
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,170
in the long run I'm and here

138
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,959
this is my one of my favorites after
they had lost recently

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,800
and that's that's what I lot looks like
that loss

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,359
peace to you I'm Council I'm

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,700
what happened here right so

142
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,210
um maybe you know if you could

143
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,190
look like this right like small talk and
that's pretty much the same examples

144
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,260
I'm except they have a okay not and

145
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,650
we still won to have both these systems
the object system and the primitive

146
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,600
system because

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,300
again I I like see and we sometime we we
need to talk to the sea world

148
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,490
and but we can't do much simpler because
just

149
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,210
do not apply foundation say that senator
and that's a seat

150
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,330
and the rest it's just objects and

151
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,760
so that that's kinda think the
motivation that

152
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,980
and in terms of I'm

153
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,960
just be a more practical small talk mean
small talk the image

154
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,790
it's a great concept but the again the
world has changed since 1980

155
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,819
I and when or even the the seventies
when when it was created

156
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,450
when when a Xerox park had their Altos

157
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,710
there was really no outside world to
talk to so

158
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,530
you know having a midget having your own
world with you that's fine

159
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm other you

160
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,430
oh that's it it is a great system

161
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,089
and I isn't that weird him

162
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,610
it'll be his now day

163
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,850
oh absolutely and then change right

164
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,529
and that's i mean i i think i yes its
its it's a pragmatic thing

165
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,269
I it you know if you if you have

166
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,330
I'm a world where you're comfortable in
the image below

167
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,050
that's great but many people don't

168
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,479
I why do we have room I'm

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,540
or and Python I am small talk should be
better than that that then the sentence

170
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,959
but I'm I think 11 big I'm

171
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,029
and problems that people had his you
know they couldn't integrating the

172
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,180
command line tool he can

173
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,609
to an SSH in any one year's Mohawk some

174
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:32,610
with you

175
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,800
it be nice if you didn't

176
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,060
it would be really nice and certainly
not it seems to me you can build a

177
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,040
a nice image you know on top of that its
it seems to

178
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,709
I mean just given history it seems to be
difficult to get

179
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,160
a good scripting UNIX shell integration
on top of that the image

180
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,170
we've been trying for a long time and we
have

181
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,880
systems but the even the fact that we
have so many of them

182
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,070
seems to indicate that may be happening
don't have good answer

183
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm so

184
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,160
you want to run the native baby I'm

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,579
and and we have a nice little object
system that's very small talk her into

186
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,500
it with objective-c

187
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,990
it's very small and so we have no yeah
he had no

188
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,410
no image and we don't even have a cheesy
which is Force Base

189
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,280
talk I'm there's my home you get to you
expecting

190
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,670
I'm the right now though the study
population is a future thing I'm working

191
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,969
on it

192
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,970
its not there yet same with objective-c
tribute equipment and and the other part

193
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,320
about being

194
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,340
it within these other systems is that
there is just so much more

195
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,490
other color on Thursday vendors you know
Apple

196
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,150
does courts they do all these kits I'm

197
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,660
having to recreate all that just doesn't
scale

198
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,990
and David Chisnall denies he was here
last year I think right

199
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,540
and he had a nice cool paperweight
anyway did some numbers

200
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,640
and he said hand those even if small
targets are 100 times more productive

201
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,640
they still couldn't match the outfit
just what is there in SeaWorld

202
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,810
so what we have I'm it's still a little
demo

203
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,810
you

204
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,540
and

205
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,180
a pic and the cursor okay so we have a
small talk scripted show

206
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,670
and

207
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,319
so you know we can do three-plus forget
so yeah it's a small talk

208
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,330
I'm we can do we can just write

209
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,590
stuff done right so low

210
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,890
we can send messages

211
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,490
to standard that

212
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,080
time we can do

213
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,940
standard string concatenation that

214
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,630
also to work for the works we can do
slightly more fancy stuff

215
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,640
so me and let's say

216
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,130
I we have and the ball

217
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,160
that works that we don't see it

218
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,640
as apps

219
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,689
and anytime I'm my syntax right

220
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,420
and so all that that sorta stuff works

221
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,670
and of course the example we had the

222
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,140
Objective C Block example let's do that
a little better I'm

223
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,800
so we had a couple strings maybe

224
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,520
and the and we do

225
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,520
do

226
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,609
so your basic small talk or spin in the
command line

227
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,980
I'm so I mean no small talk is his is a
little like that

228
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,459
I'm but I think it's it's this is a
really useful

229
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,508
a capability to hang out and especially

230
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,540
sense you can I am star

231
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,819
and doing real scripts now for example

232
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,910
I'm just to get so to sum the syntax of
the way

233
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,939
I'm went from two does is really simply
just come so

234
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:28,939
I

235
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,010
I think that's that's trio

236
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:43,360
and if we look at the helm look at this
time itself

237
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm

238
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,130
NCAA's there's no them there's another

239
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,140
ashe and Lorna does in a situation
between

240
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,760
was what what what what is a script and
what is a massive

241
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,250
so me saying this script is a method

242
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,320
from to with two

243
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,420
crackers from

244
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,589
and then adjustment France them and
having this type of med information

245
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,980
then allows me to for example doing some

246
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,130
error checking I completely
automatically

247
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,330
who because I declared what I need

248
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,520
and the thing well he didn't want any I

249
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,860
and so I'm what you have is a circuit is
the starting to get

250
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,070
a a softer architectural idea other
doctors where you have this

251
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,960
the scripting world and the math you
know the objects message messages were

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,770
all the and you started trying

253
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,009
bridge the gap

254
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:52,079
the other thing you can of course doom
I'm

255
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,719
is let's see what I have it

256
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,249
but you can and I'm

257
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:03,410
starry bringing code from

258
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,270
from your a game. drop it low is a the
app is the year

259
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,039
basically we framework and think

260
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,569
Parco and so this but this will do

261
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,188
is well it will know if I'll I

262
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,169
nationalizing image and just like that
so he'll ever tell you what the images I

263
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,020
have

264
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,870
image info through the J pick somewhere
here in various

265
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,719
New York City and

266
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,120
well so yeah yeah I

267
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,399
I'm 36 and

268
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,380
some information about the day again
hear your bridging those gaps

269
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,440
bring things closer together to make

270
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,520
make it easy made X just become more
productive

271
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,809
usually what happens

272
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,418
is when you have these two worlds I'm
you need to

273
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,210
that the bridging code tends to be so
much

274
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,200
so much more than the actual
functionality because you're you

275
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,210
especially during

276
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,230
small things but you don't do it

277
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,929
right and then you need to write a C++
at either a full programme

278
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,750
or you need to and get these other
packages involved

279
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,809
it it just becomes more cumbersome

280
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,899
okay back to slideshow

281
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:32,899
had

282
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,428
so this was trying to being object to
see you see an small talk together

283
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,720
and now we're going to talk about little
bit I'm trying I'll be on small talk

284
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,110
and again D&D idea is

285
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,479
something about that I'm I Marcus talks
about the little bit

286
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,880
at trying to specialized the language

287
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,389
I because we 10+2 at at higher levels
when we doing application programming

288
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:08,439
its it's often the case that we doing
something very similar but just so

289
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,799
its it sufficiently different that we
have to reinvent it from scratch for

290
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,539
example

291
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,908
to the example that and they also gave
if we have

292
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:20,860
I'm instance something that we've is
conceptually million instance variable

293
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,090
but we need more with them

294
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,230
and they need to be dictionaries or we
need some special functionality by their

295
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,620
when they get call we can use the
language anymore

296
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,408
directly please we have to build a
scaffolding on top I'm similar with Matt

297
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,710
messaging and if we want to have the
built in messaging to find a combined

298
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,139
a synchronous messaging or messaging
applied to collections or

299
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:50,008
some other form or remote messaging that
kinda have to build it ourselves

300
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,549
possibly go through the Indian you have
a I

301
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:59,019
in the end if ninety percent of your
program is going to be the new handler

302
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,009
maybe just maybe you need to know maybe
the language needs it'll be fixing

303
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,649
so again idea is

304
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:11,699
about what what sort of the next thing
well actually we just need to buy small

305
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,409
talk itself

306
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:18,539
right we need to stop being be able to
subclass and compose the pieces

307
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,120
them if they make it makeup the basic
system and

308
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,809
then we can build whatever language we
need which for example with the

309
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,830
escaping we just shot and

310
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,000
ok components there are I'm

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,009
polymorphic identifiers in first class
references which

312
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,049
generalize the idea of and identify and
in essence very well

313
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,830
talk about that I'm messaging

314
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,980
so we can play around with that and
finally

315
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,519
and that's the part that's at least
well-developed that's a

316
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,000
dataflow which is I'm in also wanted to

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,639
strangers asymmetries in small talk is
be assigned operator

318
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:01,219
right this kinda the one thing you can't
override there is deep reasons for that

319
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,370
but if would be nice if we could for
example have custom or

320
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,178
customer site have constraints where
it's not a one-time assignment but

321
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,419
you just say this should remain for have

322
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,269
I'm place same well it's not

323
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,100
that we just want to shove this one
thing over here but reaction I just want

324
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,139
to connect the two things

325
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:24,539
and keep people connected and

326
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,908
the inspiration for solving this is is
really

327
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:32,120
a software architecture approach and
actually

328
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,489
I'm the original by Brad

329
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,000
talks on object to see to talk very much
about software architecture in packaging

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,570
I'm and another fantastic why

331
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,928
is this one and which the

332
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,769
pick that that he's among computer
programming although they they saw the

333
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,350
base everything on the functional model

334
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,168
they I managed to get the relationships
between different programming models

335
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:02,909
in there and classify what how how far
can you go with a particular model and

336
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:03,580
when

337
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,960
should be maybe move on to something
else moment in time

338
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,409
okay I am

339
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,269
and so I when

340
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:18,750
sending thought about things for a while
and came up with

341
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,450
this what's that this is a
classification

342
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,389
of small talk in terms of such
architecture

343
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:29,668
you have basically UK

344
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,889
I'm imposter is the connector

345
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:36,479
which is just you know well let me give
architecture lead put things together

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,960
somehow

347
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,460
and declassification

348
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,190
I'm here there Islam so you know
something

349
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,480
a.m. passengers right I are I'm

350
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,320
those value as a dataflow connector I

351
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,158
you have access

352
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,359
he thinks there is local variables I'm

353
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,960
somewhere else immunity environment
variables small talk

354
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,899
doesn't happen articles but get bigger
I'm

355
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:08,070
and then have messaging which I you know
that I use as a sort of general

356
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,029
generalization of Mata procedure call I

357
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:15,139
position all these it at the time but we
don't have to

358
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,649
small yes mom we couldn't earlier
messages that I

359
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:25,158
I'm sure a synchronous I'm we have no
indication that I don't have a receiver

360
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,539
now these are are text messages but the
end we r

361
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,970
following her these things that

362
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,349
characterizes specific language and

363
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,559
I'm when I have a different language

364
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,080
we have the same overall

365
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,059
picture stress be parts this is just

366
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,840
ISO he saw this I'm now yeah

367
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,070
hiatus we have movie realism

368
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,739
with function dollars on usually
environment variables we have files

369
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,149
which

370
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:05,820
and small talk and directly going to
following in the shower just let down by

371
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,099
I and maybe in the fall

372
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:14,019
missus no why is this right as it seems
completely random to me

373
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:18,359
having looked at it for like and of
course your your

374
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,080
I'm particular problems will therefore
call for different languages

375
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,109
but for no really good reason it's just

376
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,470
somebody decided well we're gonna split
it up this way

377
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,470
and what if you could just decide to mix
it

378
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:41,299
so

379
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:45,450
whether cornerstones of that and
actually took me awhile to figure that

380
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:45,979
one out

381
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:49,019
on it is you have to be able to name
things properly

382
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,440
and the philly.com

383
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,759
start messing with the other party to
actually make naming flexible

384
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:59,769
and thats

385
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:02,919
what on the market for sorrow button and
then there was just a

386
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,950
DLS paper I'm October

387
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,999
than any language support himself sort
of particles from

388
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:13,599
and the basic idea is really just put
you take

389
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,859
the concept that for you I from the web
and putting your program

390
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,639
I'm a you can actually

391
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,199
also write your eyes so it should be
something something something

392
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,529
and have that simply identifying program
no hillary rodham

393
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,520
are here

394
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,650
research this is cool you're always

395
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,140
these uses place

396
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,080
loses know you

397
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,710
you may be searching resources for
campaign work or

398
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,300
was a cemented with

399
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,820
right yes what is actually a min and
then that this is

400
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,330
I mean I i couldn't i couldn't you
something else and come up with my home

401
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,580
by I we have your eyes and they're
called universal universal

402
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,230
room resource identifiers universal mom

403
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,910
so I just the site today syntactically
that makes some some things a little bit

404
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,710
more difficult

405
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,870
I'm but a

406
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,040
I think the pragmatics partly in this
case

407
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,270
so yes this is really just important
that concert into the program

408
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,270
the existing awesome I'm

409
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,430
you cannot make them you I accessible
I'm

410
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,040
a every scheme has has handler and you
can define your own

411
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm this solves a lot of

412
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,830
um issues for example the property
pattern where you have to chase

413
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,960
on that you know accessing dictionary
he's strong and he's

414
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,970
I if you look at for instance on the
Apple towing

415
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,180
I'm Xcode is ninety percent dictionaries

416
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,240
which scenes bought you would think you
know

417
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,530
that money my point to model actual
objects the functionality but not stick

418
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,129
children's

419
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,410
and there's reasons for that yeah
reasons in

420
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,530
on for good in the end some

421
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,200
you can also do something I'm check
alone process rest

422
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,510
I'm that essentially you fill these

423
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,250
POS system identity is I can't do that
inside

424
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,410
process and we had very good experience
reengineering ABC

425
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,580
on system using that type technique I'm

426
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,710
get it that allows you to do the
hierarchical management

427
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,980
up data um flexibly

428
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,320
without having to have a external file
system

429
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,250
for example

430
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,210
soul I'm quick de Mon who

431
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,440
out a time almost back that's

432
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,160
just see I have a network I do not have
an hour

433
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,370
miles down tools

434
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,129
back

435
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,860
be a I'll try to do some of the other
stuff

436
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,510
various do were yeah but the other ones
don't seem to work with my machine for

437
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,190
some reason

438
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,470
yeah I don't know why I people in six
years

439
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,070
yeah ABC's The View yeah and it should
work i mean another Maxime to

440
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,100
connected just minus doesn't like it i
don't understood my

441
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,580
though like okay so

442
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,540
goes back here a

443
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,500
my standard example good

444
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,010
goes and 70 and that it looked at the
source code

445
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,290
they have the meow at the end I'm I can
now

446
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,940
but that invariable I say

447
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,740
so how long is that well as you know 155
K

448
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,740
let's put that in a file a

449
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,799
and that just works right and I can

450
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,110
I can also of course when they could
have done that directly right

451
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:27,139
time

452
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,250
and I'm and variables

453
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,250
actually also have a scheme so

454
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,450
a few different one be doesn't exist

455
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,970
so that's a sign it but that's actually
the same

456
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,390
as if I say Barbie I'm

457
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,340
I can I can access environment variables
so it's my home

458
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,860
okay I'm I can nest them

459
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,389
so I have home

460
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,950
add a listing of my home directory I'm

461
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,330
and that began its integrated so I can

462
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,300
this bus thats

463
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,700
yeah consistency there so I have 89103

464
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,130
I'm for I can't just retrieve something
from their

465
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,970
I'm

466
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:30,690
long past research I'm okay I think I'm

467
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,720
said and done I'm and the first I weapon

468
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,530
at see but actually that was my last
night I have more than I stuff if people

469
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,300
are interested

470
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,620
I'm you objectives does St that's where
the

471
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,070
that the site there's a reference to get
other parts stories

472
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,689
I'm basic idea everyone scripting
compilation why do you think need to be

473
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,190
distinct I'm objects and Unix also
should much when I think together and

474
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,980
software architecture is the answer

475
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm polymorphic identifies home are some
other

476
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,820
techniques used implement that and the
step compiler is in progress

477
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,820
apply I found they don't have time saw
