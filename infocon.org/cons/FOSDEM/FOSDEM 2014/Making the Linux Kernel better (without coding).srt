1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,740
i like it

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,770
with

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,770
okay

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,990
well come for the talk making the Linux
kernel better without coding

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,209
um I with the

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,930
ask you if you want to leave during the
talk during the question-and-answer

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,869
session

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,390
following the talk police make sure to
do that to leave quietly so the others

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,340
have a chance

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,180
to listen to the talk to the question
and answers and especially if you leave

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,210
through the lol victorious

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,650
please make sure the doors are shut off
to you because otherwise it's quite hot

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,110
in here

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:51,280
thank you and thank you %uh some okay
well come

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,850
thanks for coming to my talk um

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,570
yeah I i will. first things I were a few
words about me I'm

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,610
I'm a Linux kernel hacker I to make my
living

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,750
with that but I'll decide that so I'm
also passionate actor so I also do it in

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,830
my free time in like modifying the
kernel

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,619
I happened to be the current maintainer
for the ice cream cheese sub system

21
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:16,440
which is the

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,600
a bus which is needed inside computers
and embedded systems and I take care

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,949
about the masa drivers

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,030
and I do like to share my knowledge
about

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,190
what I find out when taking the colonel
and I am really like enabled to view

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,880
to enable people to participate in
basically free and open source

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,770
development but especially in the Linux
kernel because

28
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,729
I don't think it is that heart attack on
the consulate is always said to be it

29
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,060
has

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,000
some things you should know but other
than that as is also key piece of

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,990
software which is

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,979
Britain in a in just see and so it is

33
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,090
possible to to hack the combo and in
this talk I one share some knowledge

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,550
when where you can even

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,739
contribute to the cover without knowing
and

36
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:08,220
how to code at all one thing I noticed
so far during this

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,349
conference a I I really do like you two
devices during talks both as a speaker

38
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,329
and as a

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,290
a listener so I'd really appreciate if
you could

40
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,530
a silence your devices thank you very
much

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,340
so what this is about I'm it can happen
when you set up a project and and

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,250
maybe you want to monitor something with
an old computer and then you grab into

43
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,620
your hardware box and found his old
webcam that was

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,620
cheap you don't even know where it came
from but you just have it and the

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,849
you want to plug it in and see if it
works well that's what about the

46
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,540
lol it's a actually be doing this is a
special talk to me because I will be

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,269
shown quite some things life

48
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,099
and a so you have the extra thrill of
things failing your

49
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:03,099
with me um a plug in the camera now I
want to start some

50
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,840
camera software hope to get a picture
and I just get this

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,099
very frustrating message a

52
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,268
case you make the cameras connected yes
it obviously is from

53
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,310
I can I can assure you and make

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,249
sure that the correct driver is
installed and this

55
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:26,430
the problem we have I'm there's no
driver from this camera

56
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,090
for this camera the good thing is

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,269
it lettuces as it is a very cheap camera
um

58
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,400
there are other variance of it already
out there so chances are pretty good

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,340
that Linux

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,409
has a driver for this cammarata

61
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,489
it just does not know about this
concrete instantiation of this camera

62
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,999
and this is what we're going to teach
Linux here during the stall

63
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:55,319
and how to get the necessary information

64
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,510
I we can convince Linux to support this
camera

65
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,819
so this is how it all starts I just
repeated the error message again for

66
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,030
anything just in case the

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,079
back rows could not read it as well

68
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,180
and we're going to fix that the first
thing

69
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,700
is obviously I'm to know more about the
camera and

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,420
names do not help very much we need the

71
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,320
a unique identify region case for use
the devices is a use be i ID

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,990
PCI devices homes and have fun something

73
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,030
similar and so you can just run these
from probably know them commands to find

74
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,179
out about the use Pido PCI ID

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,669
and if that's the name connected to it
if the output of

76
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,530
love those tools give you a name that
does not necessarily mean that a driver

77
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,698
are ready for it

78
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:55,630
that those two databases looks drivers
and the USB idealist are

79
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:02,630
the couple on this is the first part of
the first thing where you can take part

80
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,650
I'm because for developers it is very
very useful

81
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,710
to know which use be ID has

82
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,180
which name so if you have a camera you
type this command:

83
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,400
and see hey it does not show my camera
name there's a way for you to submit

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,000
additional information I've

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,680
mention she to web sites which have a

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,300
two ways of contributing Daytona you can
log on to the website and

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,910
a interwebs form submit additional data
say hey

88
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,930
I've noticed that the USB LSU's Bee does
not list my camera

89
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,490
this USB ID with that a

90
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,629
product id: has that name and it will be
included someone later if you know how

91
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,129
to generate pensions you can also send
the page to a

92
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,129
to a mailing list

93
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,520
I will show you the is a certain extent
Tom Kloza

94
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,639
that does not look very pretty

95
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,530
this is basically the website is not
very pretty but it's very effective

96
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,719
and you see that you can hear and ID's
and

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,379
and stuff like that not very complicated
yet very most useful for developers

98
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,039
because it

99
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,150
developers do not have a lot of cameras
so if you have

100
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,318
hardware which is not detected by Alice
use P

101
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,860
I would really encourage you to go there
and at that string

102
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,860
this camera has to that name and
developers can benefit from that

103
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,810
next step if you if you found out the
idea of that camera

104
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,060
obviously is try and do it using your
for

105
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,130
favorite search engine using that ID
number maybe the name and info probably

106
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,380
the term Linux and

107
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,909
fine for look for additional information
you will

108
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,710
usually find out a bit internals of the
camera that might be needed or not

109
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,690
usually you get the results from
distribution forums

110
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,389
which may contain the useful information
but

111
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,870
what I don't want to mention here that
you really have to watch out if the

112
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,310
form entries are like two or three years
old

113
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,729
sometimes they mention that see you have
to compile an out of pre driver from

114
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:28,300
this

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,900
that's all swatch page or so this is
usually not the case anymore most

116
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,109
most drivers are included in the main
the North cohn also it's not

117
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,639
not so complicated as it sometimes look
if you if you google around so

118
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,280
try to get information but tried to two
things that

119
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,280
these information might be outdated what
I find very helpful

120
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,900
when when heading years this is this
kind of hopper is

121
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,969
a get the information from from the
Windows drivers which are you live

122
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:02,719
usually

123
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,960
are supplied by some CD or you should
insist they'll find them on the web

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,530
and besides the binary blocks which are
totally uninteresting for this case

125
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,609
um there's also an the I i NF

126
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,449
file which is a text file describing the
driver of course I miss you really come

127
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:21,969
some

128
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,849
some kind of package so you might need
one of these classic ones underdone

129
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:26,530
shield

130
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,198
to get rid of the packing heather's

131
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,440
I found out that in most cases I even
had to use wine to really install the

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,099
drivers

133
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,669
to some some Redfin a

134
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,199
sometimes and even failed to install the
driver properly but still you can get

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,990
the ITA

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,000
in file from that era in the locations
ok wrote down there

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,050
web so most likely coming from and

138
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,359
so they're about this still available
and they're still

139
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,520
a simple text files and we can pass some
and

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,920
they show that most of these camera
drivers even also on the Windows side

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,079
a pretty generic this one driver

142
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,469
handling all sorts of cameras and
somehow these cameras are described in

143
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,300
those files

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,569
or at least relationship ships

145
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,480
relationships where you can get okay
this camera must be similar to that 10

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,510
even the same one just with a different
case

147
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,850
and there might be some other hardware

148
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:34,470
relevant in force in that this one
example from

149
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,410
from another cam way I once a added
support for Linux

150
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,240
and you really don't have to to
understand the details of that that

151
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,089
the first part was some kind of a name
of the descriptor

152
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,320
and the second part is registering the
actual

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,910
USB I'd even which for the camera we
want to support

154
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,160
the nicest thing about here that it
gives the relationship the right numbers

155
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,029
also on the next flight the next

156
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,000
a the red numbers are the USB of the
camera we want to support

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,380
lets our target and the green number is
a new information to Haiti

158
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,240
that the camera we know must be somehow
similar to the camera one speech

159
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,690
are fine okay and

160
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,680
just that those use be ID's are
mentioned in one line gives a good

161
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,599
indication that they are they worth

162
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,050
the similar very similar this is a
camera I want to support even in the

163
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,630
Windows driver the descriptor has

164
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,800
this name and so we could

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,939
though I'm back then could add a.m.
support for this camera

166
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,440
which was some she looked like a comer
accusing

167
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,720
using the information for that camera
which was I don't know some cheap

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,980
cheap I don't know company probably
Chinese I don't want to say Chinese

169
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,930
people to always cheap stuff but in that
case it was really the case

170
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,979
soul

171
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,990
with this camera its even a bit more
luxury we have lots of lines

172
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,470
on a with lots of Use be ID's and

173
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,680
the as a comment after that there was
even written some some internals

174
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,939
the first thing is the the camera chip
and the second is the sensor

175
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,959
so we can easily spot I do we have some
say

176
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,689
a similar well exactly the same entries
with different use P ID so we we gain

177
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:22,469
the same

178
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,709
this is a camera we want to support this
is the

179
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,890
genius something and

180
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,800
this is the camera where a which is
exactly similar

181
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,969
exactly a rebranded version of my camera
which is some micro Dr

182
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,680
I don't know what

183
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,270
so what we got us a similarity we know
the camera we have we want to support

184
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,860
them with a

185
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,199
we have to comply with camera which is
similar now we need to find out if this

186
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,099
new canoe

187
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,810
camera or this new ID already supported
by Linux

188
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,119
and then we can use a hand the
webservice the Linux kernel driver

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,670
database

190
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,969
or short LK DDB

191
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,030
so if you enter the new ideally we'd
find out to

192
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,819
together with the search term okay DDB
into favorite search engine

193
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:20,540
you will get the information if this is
supported by which driver and some extra

194
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,660
information about the driver and this is
what I wanted to show

195
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,290
so I'm hoping you tap

196
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,550
I use Google I enter literacy 45

197
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,800
624 see you a type this a lot during the
last days

198
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,829
okay DDB

199
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:47,630
gay we gotta hit

200
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,500
and this is from the database arm

201
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,620
lots of generic information

202
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,439
including listing all supported USB ID
so you can tell some pretty generic

203
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,040
driver

204
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,069
here this is all different cameras which
are already supported so it's not

205
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:08,240
surprised that it probably

206
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,279
supporting yet another unknown 1 the key
information at the top here for us is

207
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,540
our

208
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,870
the the driver name: the module we need
two loads

209
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,699
ina road to a and support

210
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,920
this model this driver with with our
camera

211
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,860
this is what's it's called GS PCAs and

212
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,860
9 the that 20 X

213
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,680
now comes a neat trick which is in the
coal for quite some time but it's not

214
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,900
very well known

215
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,610
that you can have to run time had to
noon you use be ID to a driver and Phil

216
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,540
will feel responsible for it

217
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,870
every driver has a static list of
drivers it feels responsible for

218
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,199
but you can extend this list at runtime

219
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,130
so first we go into super user mode so
we can load modules comacho

220
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,600
remember the drivers not loading Jets
there there's no device it's feels

221
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,640
responsible

222
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,459
for so we have to do this manually
loading the model

223
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,699
once we have the module loaded the the
driver will get an entry into surface

224
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,660
its system bus USB drivers it's long but
its kind logical

225
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,010
Haji SPCA the driver named basically

226
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,020
and there there's this file new ID to

227
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,740
regular file and you can echo a USB ID
into it

228
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,059
and the driver will start feeling
responsible for that and

229
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,079
making the best out of it this works for
use P

230
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,400
PCI cards and if you still have a PCMCIA
cards

231
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,029
um and is pretty good for a for testing

232
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,829
you out there what's current drivers
when this is also one thing

233
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,270
I want to do life

234
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,089
first said read up on the back

235
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,699
all yahoo or AOL also says yes

236
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,819
so she is can see it yes and no

237
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:19,209
C 2006

238
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,459
cities bus USB try loose

239
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,689
she's PCA

240
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:31,969
so we here we have found you I D

241
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,250
I'll all make it a little bit smaller
hope it's still readable

242
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,040
but I need what a still still okay

243
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,299
okay thanks

244
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,120
so and this is a new the idea of how
Cameron where we found out which

245
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,990
driver should feel responsible for that

246
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,630
that and were echoed into that

247
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,339
okay let's see something Apple I have
another def Tom well the

248
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,380
a follow-up messages is being locked

249
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,280
and we CEO care research GSPC is probing

250
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,709
that's good bullshit it failed

251
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,979
yeah that was the device

252
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,600
for this talk expected now

253
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,720
that's one nice thing of the

254
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,160
of the a of the Linux kernel is free and
open source software loss

255
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,130
I have giving this a similar talk where
where exactly this pattern was needed

256
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,540
and support was added but we'll there is
a

257
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,880
problem with generic drivers yeah we did
that already

258
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,140
generic drivers need para meterse

259
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,770
I the the camera chip is supported but
the

260
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,650
they support also variety of sensors so
we need stuff like which sensor do we

261
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,130
have

262
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,699
and when to what address does it live
and it doesn't have special flax

263
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,399
and if the para meterse does not match
the driver will fail and this is what

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,809
exactly happened here

265
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:14,730
it work for me when I tried it with the
last 10 but with this chemist failed

266
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,789
not bad my computer still lives and I
can assure the commerce to live so you

267
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,189
can really try around things and

268
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,689
their chances that you break some
harbors very close to zero

269
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,130
so just play around with that if you if
you're try to add hardware don't be too

270
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,429
afraid

271
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,059
so no I had the problem I had my talk
accepted I had the comer of

272
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,799
and those things did not work so what
did I do

273
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,830
I made it work I sent some patches to
the Linux kernel which are accepted

274
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,220
meanwhile there already upstream a

275
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,590
so I'm running here at cana which is
like three days old

276
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:59,590
or something and this introduces the
concept of a reference ID

277
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
remember we found out that the

278
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,799
there is a camera which is very very
similar if not identical E

279
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,250
identical except for the kit for the
casing

280
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,070
to this one so I can should be able to
say to the driver

281
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,840
feel responsible for that use be idea
and use a power meter set from that use

282
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,149
be I D

283
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,910
and that is what I implemented

284
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,049
the first line here is of course if
there's a new ID that's also remove ID

285
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,020
to get rid of

286
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,410
a like he a broken broken entries

287
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,240
this is what we do through first to get
rid of the broken entry

288
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,299
and then we say to the driver fee
responsible to that

289
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,660
use P ID 0 well we could assign

290
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,110
use P class p1 needed here we ignore it
the role

291
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:57,110
and use the driver set for that camera
we hung from the Windows driver

292
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,930
let's try that

293
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,190
so act cool remove already

294
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,190
him call move four-fold for

295
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:21,080
well

296
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,840
let's check again things is correct

297
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,379
okay there was a slight delay

298
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,290
before the prompt return that give some
hope let's see the last lines of the

299
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,870
the output is probing again own as a
census

300
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,030
detector that sounds pretty well it also
created an input device so that's a

301
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,270
button on top of the camera so this

302
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,170
part in it I'll just the last lines are
needed

303
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,180
the are you can see I'm sorry

304
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,730
okay her

305
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,090
so that that gives hope to start the

306
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,669
camera program again here we go

307
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:15,670
where the camera on

308
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,059
so that was no

309
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,000
see knowledge in Walter was echoing to a
pseudo for and just a bit of knowledge

310
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
okay it since it not very obvious
knowledge I agree

311
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,480
but this is how

312
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,470
people can can head were hocker to to
the Linux kernel because as a developer

313
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,320
you joining your

314
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,500
only just have a few cams you can write
the driver for that but you can never

315
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,140
have the bunch of chocolate which is out
there and there's also some kind of

316
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,690
of crowd tossing people you will have
all kinds of hardware and so

317
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,730
with such mechanisms we can get hmm

318
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,110
main thing Linux kernel support our
prayer even more hardcore than it

319
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,280
already does i mean it's pretty good
already but we can still be better

320
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,220
so now the camera works for me or for
you

321
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,230
but it would be free and open source
software if we'll

322
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,040
were keeping that for ourselves what to
do with that knowledge if you're not

323
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,149
into programming and creating patches
it's totally fine to write an email

324
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,520
similar like this yeah I found this out

325
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,740
and the I don't really want to create a
patch that all too complicated for me

326
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,540
yes a knowledge can somebody do
something with it

327
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,840
that's perfectly fine I'll give you some

328
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,840
seconds to read it the key question here
is

329
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,870
them whom to send email to over so
somebody feels responsible

330
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,428
and there are some some hints the first
this

331
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm there's a calm common tomato info
which will give you money you of course

332
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,300
who wrote the model

333
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,620
you could have a look into that

334
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,379
you could have a look at the at the
beginning of the source file

335
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,660
and the nice thing about us Ltd know the
Linux kernel driver database

336
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,740
has links to the salsa so you don't even
have to have the

337
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,520
the notes kernel source installed I just
want to show that he/she

338
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
page again and if we go down dun dun dun
dun dun

339
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,220
you see here

340
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,450
it has a link drivers media use be

341
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,730
and then we have a

342
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,800
the link to some across indexed

343
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,560
source file and then you can fuck
probably find here some email addresses

344
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,409
as well

345
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,650
and if you're interested in a little bit
of coding you can just the

346
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,490
also have a look how this driver works
what it does what to do maybe does not

347
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,090
if they're fixing using it and just

348
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,689
have a look how how such a driver looks
like it's not

349
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,690
rocket science if you have

350
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,620
Connell sauces install there's a nice
script

351
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,229
the subdirectory scripts I am I'll

352
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,320
yeah it's called get maintainer it will
give you a list of people

353
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,669
print simply print a list of people who
you are you should have in your

354
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:21,140
assisi from the mail a I use it myself
when I creating patch here is a good

355
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,540
tool to use for

356
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,629
when in doubt always lose the

357
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,670
big big famous El Campello

358
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,790
mailing list was which I wrote down
there and to be very sure just at me

359
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,490
and I will track if somebody

360
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,820
from the subsystem will pick it up and
if not then I would just create the page

361
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,310
because it's a low hanging fruit

362
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,668
so tell me okay if you'd say I don't
want to do it but

363
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:52,590
you could even try if not

364
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:59,590
I say it slowing food I would a gain of
his league the camera will work for you

365
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,240
the camera off work for the rest of the
world someone

366
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,860
when I everything went up steam and if
everything went

367
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,800
proper and there's a patch entering the
Linux kernel you will be credited

368
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,330
like this reported by and then you have
your name in the

369
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,230
history repeat history of the the Linux
kernel for some

370
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,559
some don't care for some it gives a warm
and cozy feeling so

371
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:32,010
you decide so

372
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,210
you could stop there are you could move
on

373
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,950
next steps possible steps I don't want
to talk in detail about grr

374
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:47,150
create the patch itself arm the I O

375
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,090
more don't give any pointers for
creating patches here there lots lots of

376
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,709
them are

377
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,500
1 comment I want to make a set you don't
necessarily have to

378
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,929
para use get if you want to create a
gimpy a simple patch if you want to do

379
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,400
serious cuddle hacking I really
recommend learning

380
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,540
get if you don't know it already but for
such simple pages you can do like pearl

381
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,360
to other

382
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,959
a more basic patch management software
that's totally fine

383
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,820
there how to use how to work with that
on the net to easily find them

384
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,960
for colonel related stuff I have I added
two pointers

385
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,640
um how the kernel development process

386
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,169
works in general and what you should
take care when submitting patches

387
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,159
I think it's worth reading even if
you're in not

388
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,210
deciding on continuing working on the
Linux kernel but some of the rules

389
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,270
a pretty good for I think most a

390
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,820
software projects it's not necessary
that everyone

391
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,100
every product should a bit of the exact
color rooms

392
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,120
cardinal rules but I'm

393
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,100
it gives you an idea what should be
proper what should be formalized

394
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,379
to be working on a large scale project
like the Linux kernel

395
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,490
and if you do code if you Cody

396
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,330
then you could also try and playing
around with the driver

397
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,100
when I first got the camera I noticed
there's an LED does not work

398
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,360
so I one idea would be to

399
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,719
take why this is this is a simple thing
you could check it check the driver

400
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,320
while

401
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,418
where the LED is controlled and what you
could do about it

402
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:32,150
to be honest this problem is already
solved when I travel to Brussels I had

403
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,970
some free time in the train into

404
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,950
I find out why so I'm sorry this has
already taken

405
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,040
and and of stuff like that

406
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,220
the camera can get pretty slow

407
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,290
when when there's not enough life
because it has up

408
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,100
automatic exposure settings and other
cameras have

409
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,199
and option to enable and disable
automatic exposure

410
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,890
so you can disable it so the camera will
be faster at the price of the

411
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,740
a too light or too dark pictures

412
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,640
this camera does not have that it has
always auto exposure

413
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,110
so tries to make the best other flight
but it came

414
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,428
grows slow so you could try to find out

415
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:22,360
is a way to control that can I have a
button for that second set the tone of

416
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,918
thats how you could possibly get into

417
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,500
driver hiking is a especially eek

418
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,630
it's a cheap cam you really don't have
to be afraid of doing any greater damage

419
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:40,110
really good good for playing around

420
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,199
you know that was basically years um

421
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,740
I like to have enough time for questions

422
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,429
so this is what the slides are questions
right now I will be at for them

423
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:56,360
until tomorrow noon probably so if you
see me just just

424
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,189
approach me and ask me questions or what

425
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,950
come for a chat hard well that's my
email address you can

426
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,800
write me a man if you have questions so
that was this for now owns

427
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,399
fire away yes thank you for a broad
vision

428
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
them looking at which was saying

429
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,740
I think it would be very valuable to
other scripts

430
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,610
sup so you select but the a device like
a piece I device on USB device

431
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,300
you provide maybe they exited from five
from the Windows driver

432
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,668
on them inside this crypt makings a I
know if analysis

433
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,780
and to compare the medicaid is a I'll

434
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,620
so that the busy show I'm try although
automatically

435
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,668
the the trick to show them

436
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:46,190
until we have a new input device or
maybe could help

437
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,510
people to get to bring you comer

438
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,860
as you did give its the windows were
which is ok to use the provided with it

439
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,020
because

440
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,040
the windows I'll set is much more
because in the next one

441
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,030
on the itemized also the texan want to
say okay as is I did

442
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,700
is the one we are looking for her
although it was so you're suggesting a

443
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,340
script which posits the Windows driver

444
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,928
and try some combinations for the use be
ID's and check if it get something to

445
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:13,350
work

446
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,520
may be passing Zeina fine which is given
with the

447
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,030
a with the tomorrow no on then after

448
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,730
readings i ne fine funny also possible a
solution wizard

449
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,880
existing realize that we already have

450
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,929
the governor the bus owns and make sure
it reached to trade all the conditions

451
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:34,850
that exist onto the tracks

452
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,730
I'm a yeah I i think i ideas China
challenging in

453
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,750
if you if you like to do that just feel
free one thing I'd like to mention is

454
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,560
that

455
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,610
Windows drivers are still binary clock
so we can look inside them

456
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,120
and it might be that they have some a

457
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,229
extra code for some extra camera she

458
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:02,040
so I i really love if the new use P ID
is added to the kernel

459
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,129
as a patch it should be tested on real
hardware are not on on on speculation

460
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,370
this is what I would suggest but it's
really a

461
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,540
useful to um

462
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,658
to have these files in mind and then
look for potential cameras

463
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,510
and a you could like try to find people
on the net you had problems with that

464
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,230
camera

465
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,260
and Austin if they could a try this line

466
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,300
and then echo the ID to use the ID

467
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,540
to new ID to what I did here and then
you could check

468
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,440
with someone who has a real hardware and
then at this apart a little

469
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,820
going that totally automatically is not
my preferred style

470
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,960
their lol hi I'm

471
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,210
I think that all other third US bid USB

472
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,560
devices the are there

473
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,908
unknown USB ID's on the and

474
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,389
what about turn on but league
specifications

475
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:08,490
the and did people tried two-thirds the

476
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,889
in butts that the

477
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:13,369
to send run them starts tonight news
feed

478
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:16,499
device in order to see what the they get
back

479
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,139
not that I know of

480
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:23,458
her but the

481
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:27,079
this as a side project I'm not really
a.m.

482
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:34,079
and use the expression a I know that
there's some

483
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,799
some companies using use be I numbers
with the which a

484
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,049
they shouldn't but it's not it's just
laziness

485
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,499
it looks like the sloppiness or laziness
or something in between

486
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:49,609
what I do know mostly that most there's
still a numbers of

487
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:53,809
use the ID missing descriptions like
expensive cameras

488
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,168
if you type in LSU's be you just see the
vendor but not the product name so I

489
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:58,719
really

490
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:02,849
call again for crowdsourcing check check
your USB devices check if they have

491
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,059
proper names and maybe submit them to

492
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:12,059
to the USB idealists that would be
really great

493
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,139
there pay thank you for this earned talk
and

494
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,719
inspires me to do something myself may
have a camera at home

495
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,539
but the thing is I know already that
this come a must scan a must have some

496
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,360
initialization routine to get that can
mold is on

497
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,008
so what I need to do is I need to have
some yeah whatever

498
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,730
tracing morsel for the USB protocol to
see

499
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,019
what is needed to get the camera into
this

500
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:43,360
about commode a so for sure I have would
have to do this on the windows with the

501
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,500
drivers are running

502
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,399
is there any tool that you can suggests
to do such you use be tracing

503
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,620
I haven't done the

504
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,350
that myself the

505
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,279
so they refuse peacekeeping software for
Windows

506
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,909
so they intercept the USB stick and
pretty print out what

507
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:07,799
has been sent back and forth I think
it's called news piece new

508
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,299
well used PCP or something like this:
there is also a hopper

509
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,120
new the the the them are more expensive
there

510
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,668
quite expensive but very convenient but
quite expensive

511
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:25,320
maybe I don't know of any free hardware
but

512
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm me might be true might be just like
in the information here but there is but

513
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,629
I know there is software for Windows
which intercepts the stack

514
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:36,469
USB stick and print your the
communication between the camera and the

515
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,840
Windows host and then you can we
implemented them on Linux

516
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,189
that sounds good please do that so

517
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,309
one point about her he was featured a
scene and you can also on our mission

518
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:51,940
machine this one also noted and

519
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,019
trial Ashok issues beam on and then you
look and

520
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:03,019
show do tracing

521
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,450
so us

522
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,859
321 last chance Connell

523
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:23,859
so thank you very much bartending and
have a great conference

524
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,118
thank you very much and we'll continue
the engine side

525
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:37,119
3 o'clock went to Europe occasion versus
GB

526
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,640
up

527
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:41,950
up

528
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:14,650
up

529
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:36,110
up

530
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:41,320
and
