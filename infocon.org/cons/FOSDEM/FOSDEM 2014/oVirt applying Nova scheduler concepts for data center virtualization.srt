1
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,930
can you give me

2
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,970
%um okay

3
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,229
I wanna start hi my name is you and I
work for a

4
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:18,650
coming with Claudia and I'm working for
the SL and scheduling thing

5
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,330
them going to talk about scheduling with
an over

6
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,910
howard got the ball basically

7
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,940
will talk about the problem of
scheduling a little bit

8
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,500
dan will go hand talk about Nova

9
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,729
feel to schedule concept and then we'll
be diving into

10
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,910
over scheduling a lotta sample think the
best way to understand

11
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,440
top power through sample

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,289
K can you raise your hand if you heard
about over

13
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,200
yeah I guess love you I

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,240
home crowd so over does appear on now

15
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,030
doe those appeared on orders over
already there

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,649
and management platform for be and based
on

17
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,849
KVM hypervisor can handle

18
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,450
thousands of the am have live snapshot
live

19
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,160
storage migration live me and migration
live

20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,549
everything is live basically and

21
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,020
sorry we support also advanced after
configuration for those those

22
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,560
and a lot on storage connections Sun

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,050
NFS cluster sector basically

24
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,470
let the what we've got a long time ago

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,180
and

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,830
got the questions from the uses the
eighth I add you to use at least if you

27
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,450
have any questions about over

28
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,750
it's quite no quite active

29
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,830
how can I define a maximum number

30
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,090
running VM spur holes a it's pretty
trivial but we didn't support it

31
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,460
that yet then so

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,440
we get back to it later just wanted to
say that you should use the users list

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,400
okay what we had in order yeah

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,950
long time ago basically we had to
distribution algorithms for

35
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,459
a running migrating VM when we select
the

36
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,310
p.m. when we ran a VM then with selected
to host based on

37
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,190
CPU load party theme be there

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,500
even distribution and CPU load of
power-saving

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,020
and then it's pretty you know

40
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,010
limited we have only two distribution
algorithm then we can construct the

41
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,390
user-defined one

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,640
basically added it then

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,000
a with a

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,430
we take a low

45
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,480
with looked at their number scheduler
which is

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
with which prop apps filter then waits

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,829
very simple and easy way to

48
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,030
fielder a to schedule p.m.

49
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,420
on hosts basically the feather very

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,549
Kat and clear logic that

51
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,570
gets a set get two-thirds of both on the
left hand side then we're on the field

52
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,270
their own

53
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,120
on them then we apply way weights on top
of them

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,210
another call live from

55
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,289
no scheduler recollect the

56
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,340
we collect a set of weights then with
something up

57
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,289
and then we ordered a host that we've
got let's see a thin

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,100
a simple them both for another scheduler
hey this is around filter

59
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,950
written in Python basically it

60
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,270
very simple method

61
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,780
that gets a single hole stay down

62
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,619
and then and a set the properties and
then

63
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,890
run really simple call that

64
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,150
ida and decide

65
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,679
if the best this health in and the
scheduling process

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,660
are extract excluding excluding the from
the scheduling process

67
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,150
a according to the request a drum

68
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,250
for that p.m. okay

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,220
when we looked at and

70
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,270
took it to they data center versed

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,919
virtualization which is over it we
thought that we have a little bit

72
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,280
problem with that concept

73
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,489
because in and and no I

74
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,000
each filter and weight is applied on a
single host

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,860
and we have a larger concept of fair
plastering

76
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,000
in over it which called migration domain

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,100
so in that in and one

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,500
migration to me each hole each VM on a
host

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,850
can be migrated to a separate also not
migration demand that cluster

80
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:13,330
and we have another concept of love
about something a for that cluster

81
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,349
and also a policy container

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,610
which a user can decide and creates on
policy

83
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,860
and applied at on that plaster so

84
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,160
let's take a look what we had in over
basically we can create

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,050
internal and external filter and weights
the internal part

86
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,110
is used for better performance

87
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,070
we r eat within the server so we gotta
quick access

88
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,190
to the DB and originally

89
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,219
all the all the filter and weights from

90
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,820
the previous the overdue back down when

91
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,060
when we didn't have a phantasm way well
migrated into that internal scheduler

92
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,580
and extend on that you it

93
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,900
basically all the users can support and
expand

94
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,520
a we apply all the filters

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,620
in reply the filter and and waits on

96
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,990
all the hosts in the cluster for better
performance

97
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,020
and we want to have a better grasp of

98
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,029
how the copay the class their behaves

99
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,250
we have that contain and

100
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,680
with called that their policies for you
for each cluster we can

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,760
defined set the filter is that the
weights

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,070
and I think a load-balancing preach
plaster and then with support

103
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,150
custom properties that you can its kinda

104
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,039
pass through to to the filter and way

105
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,340
this is and I come up the new model

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,979
under on the left hand side we can see
if that the host

107
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,859
within the cluster then we apply each
filter

108
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,680
chaining each been to one on top of the
other and

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,880
then we construct the way table

110
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,990
which get as the result of the

111
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,979
selected holes that we want to schedule
the VM long

112
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,400
a we had the same concept that

113
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,700
and as no band filters the existing
logic

114
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,779
that we had previously which were on
basically validation was

115
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:29,460
and migrated into a internal filters

116
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,319
and we can extend it using extent a

117
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,029
you in Python using the extent of
schedule and that I will get into later

118
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,390
on tissue show you where a really

119
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,580
easy sample how we can use filters
basically

120
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,670
this is their pictures during Python

121
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,319
the name on the class will be the name
that

122
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,190
re that day and did the server gets

123
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,240
the properties valued Asian I basically
a set of

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,339
property that you can add within the
server

125
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,160
and then the filter we get it

126
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,120
this is the name on the filter and this
is actually the signature that and you

127
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,200
need to override in order to extend out

128
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,070
a to extend a filter to add a few 222
system

129
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,560
this is how you get this is how you get
their custom properties

130
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,599
from the eat within the filter basically

131
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,839
I didn't tell you what the fielder is
all about but

132
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
here you can see we get that time

133
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,580
and if the time in within the interval

134
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,980
that we get from the on the user

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,640
then we friend doubt

136
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,730
be reprint the holes returned all the
hold that we got

137
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,270
if not we just every move it through all
the holes from the filter

138
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:05,270
that on about band example

139
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,189
let's talk about the weights the

140
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,500
it waits all the field all the hope that
the path food

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,760
filters we have they're pretty fine way

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,069
that day first two are a

143
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,029
our CPU load fielder than than 3.4

144
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,089
we adalat mall wat models

145
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,210
said wat models

146
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,620
with its kinda easy now to add because
we have the new architecture

147
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,170
each filter can and

148
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,449
have factors it began

149
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,149
for outside the field the sorry filters
each way

150
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,330
can have factors can for their prior to
the fact that

151
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,910
day way to the factors weakened also

152
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,189
X addicts down way let

153
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,040
see and now to a sample in this sample

154
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,269
we use a connection to our

155
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,070
air tour the survey using and

156
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,959
iPhone SDK that we have he says the K is
backward compatible unstable

157
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,829
we connect to the STK and then

158
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:22,529
the logical all the way as basically we
iterate over

159
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:24,149
all day Hey

160
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,490
all the whole and we have planned to
release the top beloved a host lady

161
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,990
and way to the up that hosts

162
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,430
here it's still with cop but the whole
their way to the whole thing the

163
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,899
number back to game p.m. on that tells

164
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,990
so if we have the halls with

165
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,370
basically we ordered by and

166
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,300
numb the number running p.m. within that
tells

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,160
that's continuing talk about

168
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,339
a deal obon thing that the

169
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,630
that the third model we have the in

170
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,810
the cluster policy each I suppose you
can have a

171
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,569
only one and load balancing logic
basically

172
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,010
you can do whatever you want with in the
long bond thing connected the SDK and

173
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,520
you can shut down everything basically
but

174
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,930
work with the point entirely is that the
lot about thing logic will return

175
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,099
at the AGM but the host I was showing
and a sample later on

176
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,640
a and we will my god that

177
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,480
p.m. a single p.m. came within

178
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,220
server it's basically more say

179
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,760
to to migrate the single VM within

180
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,980
you know as a period of time not to

181
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,480
causing migration Ross and way

182
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,630
use all our resources for that pretty

183
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,370
not safe to do that we also have

184
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,380
pretty fine load balancing a

185
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,580
within over the two legacy ones on

186
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,530
CPU and now heading 3.4 even
distribution one

187
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,110
that we even p.m. distribution that
we're didn't have

188
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,420
the same the

189
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,500
bong thing sample data on the show

190
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,240
as I showed earlier is

191
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,430
we get the same number that we want to
shut down

192
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,819
all the VM but in this example we will
actually do doubt

193
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,030
and not exclude all set a prevent users
from running

194
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,250
oath a VM like in the future example

195
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,110
do is show how and that the hour in the
wake up our

196
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,590
we will basically

197
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,840
a get all the holes

198
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,790
and if its wake up call will activate
all the oath

199
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,540
if we need to sleep and the

200
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,459
band we will connect using ours the
Cayenne get all the VM's from that tells

201
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,170
we will stop all that the and Sandwell
deactivate the whole

202
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,189
same bank example

203
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:26,190
this is how we use it internally to
migrate VM

204
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,640
you get a

205
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,230
according to some logic you get the
overloaded host

206
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,690
its called snippet then you

207
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,870
select here it's random the pros p.m. on
that tells

208
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,000
then we actually printed because we
using

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,330
we reusing yesterday I'll to to get the
data

210
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,130
a from the from the Madhu

211
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,390
and we return it and return a ride

212
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,460
listed holes which is kind of a filter

213
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,930
the first with filtering we do before we

214
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,770
activates the filter on weights and

215
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,079
the normal process that we do basically

216
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,120
as I said we have a class that policy
which is a container for all the filter

217
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,400
and weights and I think the loading bar
a bomb thing you

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,569
logic and we have to optimization

219
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,270
part of the policy a speed in

220
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,560
overbooking basically we're on the each
time we schedule a VM

221
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,890
we want one by one because we want to
prevent

222
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,180
overbooking a the same we're onto

223
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,300
we want to guarantee the same and
resources for

224
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,589
preachy and if you will a try to
schedule to be and

225
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,030
together we can fail because they the
book they both the the same

226
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,350
resources so

227
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,860
basically the speed optimization in

228
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,329
to exclude the Wayne

229
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:10,569
over the their whole so later on their
load balancing will do the way

230
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,320
fourth and bong sound

231
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,530
the class the hot and the overbooking is

232
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,170
to omit the Island

233
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,390
just be able to power lies with

234
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,520
the sketching process let

235
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,579
see who can have show those pictures

236
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:40,580
with a nowhere okay

237
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,189
candice is over the Amiens

238
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,680
you know because im wifi and and BP and
a VM is unknown

239
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,859
it's running somewhere and

240
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,250
here

241
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:13,250
I configure here I can configure a new
class the poly thing

242
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:23,019
can give it a name like the shutdown 1

243
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,170
I can and

244
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,230
day external filter that I added to the
system the shutdown of

245
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,990
filter today enabled filter is

246
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,770
and is the way to I am

247
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,080
I will give their optimal for power
saving

248
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,139
thats try to undo gated

249
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,260
all the VM for with Anna single

250
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,120
host as much as possible dowell

251
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,370
a select data a day about that I

252
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,080
pay created earlier I can

253
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,879
give it wake up are like 8 a.m.

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,070
and shut down our

255
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,730
8 press OK

256
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:23,699
should be created

257
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:30,699
and no can

258
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,870
that

259
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,580
okay let's go back to that now

260
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,309
shouldn't take some time what

261
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,039
not connected

262
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,990
to do bpm can only be

263
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,529
something happened to the BP and doesn't
like me

264
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,620
yeah I have screens

265
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,580
I have mentioned about you know maybe

266
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,809
to work thank him okay let

267
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,820
taken schemes going it works believe me

268
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,779
K

269
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:22,779
were

270
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,550
were here

271
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,330
them

272
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,300
now

273
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,570
there

274
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,409
now nevermind

275
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,410
show you that Prime then you go to
cluster

276
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:58,940
film forget about

277
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,060
okay I create

278
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,200
attractive policy that up showed you

279
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,240
then I created to a cluster that lol you
find

280
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,180
so all the hosts within the got there we
are not going to that plastic polythene

281
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,620
okay

282
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,100
let's talk about how it's implemented
the

283
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,639
in you know back its

284
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,030
disabled by default hey we ever want to
expand

285
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,270
to add filters should be able to know

286
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,230
how to install dick down scheduler that
thou scheduler

287
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,720
and a separate process a

288
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,770
retain Python we external I that because
we want to guarantee the engine

289
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,210
safety nets you know if the user rights
called it can be

290
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,730
dangers to the system we want to allow

291
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,830
other long languages well all if you
know the end

292
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,250
overcame is written in Java so

293
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,470
and this model is it written in Python

294
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,720
and going for you want this to

295
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,320
the support to stop which is

296
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,230
Ghana

297
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:28,220
scheduling at the service I'll

298
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,919
yeah at two separate IP and you need to

299
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,940
and Manny though it and how it works
basically

300
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,490
initialize it run it reads from mom

301
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,980
local directory all the filters

302
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,409
a weights and and bouncing logic that

303
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,649
you wrote than prop publishing

304
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,418
down i PI the engine the server

305
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,669
read it and then it waits for

306
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,950
a calls from the engine for filtering

307
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,149
weighing and balancing this is how it
looks like

308
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:11,850
when loaded

309
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,719
the field and low bong here K

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,789
and back to the uses the eighth now we
can

311
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,840
is the right to filter that

312
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,418
Latin maximize the number

313
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,620
running good p.m. for both

314
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,139
in

315
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:37,699
early okay to summing up

316
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,700
a we safar the easy Python

317
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,720
blogging for you to use a full

318
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,450
p.m. scheduling hey you can ok and
manages

319
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,860
separate policy for each cluster
believes

320
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,719
Google both and everybody in that

321
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,909
comes out for over gets new

322
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:05,619
model all good question

323
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,139
yes West

324
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:15,949
the speed to read would

325
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,330

350
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,370

the schedule

351
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,620
to BMC system that these monitoring

352
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,750
star upon tools for example they can
monitor all

353
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,470
arm the Cebu temple tonight and the fan
speed and they can actually predict

354
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,950
that these defense tips fan speed is
constant

them

358
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,840
list upholstered they can actually be at
