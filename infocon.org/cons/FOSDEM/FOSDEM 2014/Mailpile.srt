1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,250
and were come with me be a neuroma I
have some you a present

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,390
mail pile and let's go I think

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:14,390
can you guys hear me hi

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,740
this is a brief introduction to where

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,519
my qualifications just a bachelor's pure
science

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,169
education I've been doing the nixon
stuff since

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,980
police officers I for very long

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,170
as a result pay

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,500
decided to dedicate myself to a
full-time 2010

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,820
and I've managed to pull that off one
way or another

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,329
on my latest project project working
with Brandon smilin

12
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,390
nice community people is called male

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,420
and in brief mail pile

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,789
is email there's been some confusion

15
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,020
we're using web-based technology for use
face

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,850
some people think maybe it's a server
but no it's not a mail server is a male

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,860
it's built on web-based technologies

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,030
so we can use monitor web design to make

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,909
the place me accessible has a powerful
search engine which is actually held

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,310
project started and we're hoping to make
it really easy for people to use pgp

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,210
both assigned 15 obviously

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,389
free software we're currently in a weird
to licensing face with a code is

23
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,990
available

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,699
two licenses plan to drop one of those
in our community has voted on what they

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,320
prefer

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,839
and it's written in popular which is

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,290
iPhone asked up I say the project to
take email

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,399
that's so what are we talking about

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,950
first half this heart is motivation
history project

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,380
not a long history so I feel ok and then

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,369
the second half I'm gonna go in the
summer the technical details because I

32
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,680
know you guys all techies

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,920
so why nothing

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,939
I'll I don't mean to offend anyone

35
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,090
I actually like the state free software
email has been

36
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,470
pretty crap for a while there's not a
lot of development

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,970
things are away with doing

38
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,090
things is kinda stuck in the night and I
feel like we need to catch up because if

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,160
the free software community is going to
compete with Gmail

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,459
Microsoft we need to innovate by

41
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,629
stories which have been doing

42
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,799
each other and if we dole we will never
have massacres

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
you will always be on the back postcard

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,209
while we're trusting the cloud or use a
proprietary software

45
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,120
so this is important I'll

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,780
email has been becoming increasingly
centralized in my opinion I

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,920
people these days when I think email me
just sort of assumed that its

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,530
gmail haha they just assume that some
were running on someone else's heart

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,170
lot of companies don't bother any mail
servers and a lot of schools don't

50
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,609
bother

51
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,080
government organizations tall other
emails

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,510
I think this is a bad track up

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,149
but it's going to continue we don't
provide for I don't like having you know

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,709
in the cloud filtering my spam for me
because I consider that to be a form of

55
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,379
censorship

56
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,010
like have my spam filtering my machine
they need to have all

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,429
data fine if it gets lost Google filter
something away

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,920
I have no idea why I don't know what
happened

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,030
but they provide good service

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,860
it's Richie all you have to do is pay
for it with your privacy and

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,530
at Bridgestone has explained one why
that's a bad thing I'll

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,200
Ivan mother has talked about this and
Richard Stallman

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,060
has been talking about this for a long
time him in his

64
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,019
he's right how stuff in the cloud when
other people are running

65
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,170
things for us that's worse for our
freedoms then

66
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,260
closed doors so I like to piss people
off by saying that now Microsoft is our

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,768
ally

68
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,160
because honestly at least Microsoft
letting you run it offers up

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
when you put the stuff in the cloud and
they have

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,710
the we lock you in it's very hard

71
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,000
have this from natural monopoly effect

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,949
biggest provide always seems to win
gravitates their

73
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,500
have massive centralized silos

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,199
data and and terrible for privacy it's
bad for a lot of

75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,889
I there's also a risk

76
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,680
something which some people in the room
were old enough to remember

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,470
do you guys remember Microsoft strategy
breaks extend and extinguish

78
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,449
so for the crowd progressive you

79
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,539
I'll this is what Microsoft tried to do
to the open web

80
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,550
so they said hey this web thing is tiny

81
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,949
let's give everyone a free browser and
you know

82
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,970
to explore a became

83
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,800
this thing called active and they
increase

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,490
developers in the Microsoft ecosystem to
use ActiveX to make their website more

85
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,759
do it me you know call fancy do anything

86
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,699
so they extended the web using
proprietary technology

87
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,270
and they were hoping that by doing so
another website

88
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,289
moved to using their proprietary version
well

89
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,930
that they will kill you because nobody
else had after

90
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,440
and it was a it was closed not there's a
risk

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,449
this happening with things like email we
let the clock run

92
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,930
for us and we've already seen

93
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,160
very small its things moving in this
direction

94
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm sorry to pick on Google cuz I used
there and they're nice guys

95
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,460
but the example have does come from
Gmail

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,130
gmail stirred features where he sent
messages

97
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,069
perform and interpret way Angele partner

98
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,919
and buttons might show might be able to
buy something

99
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,979
within your email and to be able to do
stuff that

100
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,940
you won't be able to do with any other
e-mail for this story to extend

101
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,650
making something that it never was
before and making something that is

102
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,669
definitely not an open standard

103
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,530
is not interoperable with the rest to
the so this is happening

104
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,580
and it's something that we should beware

105
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,969
and then of course email to close
fundamentally incompatible with the

106
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,229
group

107
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,219
and the reason for that is these cloud
providers they all

108
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,720
base their businesses on advertising

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,169
dangerfield target those out and the cat
target those

110
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,469
can read the content agreement they
don't know what you're talking about the

111
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,530
cash only relevant advertisements

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,909
they were making money so they're never
going to accept a man

113
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,949
aside from the fact he's a bad idea

114
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:04,710
they're just not do so

115
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,229
I was worried about this on to other
people worried about this

116
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,530
so we came with this idea let's build
mail pile

117
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,960
let's do it will be strategically

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,549
you want to achieve five think we want
to make software the

119
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,419
piece of community enjoys hiking on guys
like to play with

120
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,430
something accessible the community
wonderful software this

121
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,699
regular people want to use so it has to
be attractive and user-friendly

122
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,110
fast and all those things weeks what's
up

123
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,110
we want to make the mill Creek's
understandable so people will do it

124
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,590
without thinking about it

125
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,049
it can't be something that just techies
do everyone to do

126
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,110
and want to make easy decentralized me
easy for people to take their data back

127
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,430
run their own infrastructure and you
know move out of the cloud as much as

128
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,780
possible

129
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,710
and even if not everyone does this will
have a noticeable

130
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,039
benefit to overall

131
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,680
tech community it'll keep contact

132
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,009
people can leave and they were they will
be happy

133
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,639
finally we need to find better business
Paul because

134
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,680
10 the achilles heels the peace of the
community is so much work is done by

135
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,240
volunteers

136
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,080
and we have very limited resources we
need to figure out ways to actually do

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,969
this

138
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,800
top so this is the sort of stuff that
we're thinking about

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,209
up timeline for the project so far

140
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,899
2011 I wrote an experimental search
engine

141
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,690
I was able to search all my email in no
seconds it was great

142
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,680
and then I went back to

143
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,899
nothing happened 2012 was looks like

144
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,209
there but in 2013 things are

145
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,768
I'll Prince maroney been harassing me
and say hey

146
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,850
you know let's do something with his
male hoping kinda cool

147
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,970
using Thunderbird they don't like it I
want something better

148
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,390
and I kept saying go away

149
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,680
we bumped into president who is a user
interface design

150
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,959
bumped into him in the hot tub one
schools in downtown Reykjavik

151
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,930
had a nice chap think anymore either

152
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,589
bumped into a mechanic cafe he was
following

153
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,810
for what had some coffee we had to be
here

154
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,130
he looked over my shoulder like what are
you working I'm playing with his email

155
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,320
thing

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,740
and 10 minutes later email for the
project

157
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,370
we're still using so we decided to join
forces we

158
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,470
we came up with this plan and we decided
to do

159
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,930
fundraising campaigns we raised
beginning to go

160
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,420
fundraising campaign launched in August
us that the old festival

161
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,269
fantastic and we see we raise enough
money

162
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,890
we can work on this full time for your
and actually a little bit extra

163
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,839
economy sling current budget for just

164
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,269
gets 16 17 18 months out other

165
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:13,430
depends a bit help it clean develop

166
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,089
have instruments that way

167
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,470
but yeltsin since September we've just
had our heads down we've been writing

168
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,910
going to a couple conferences talk but
for the most part we've just

169
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,709
and 2014 realize well you know we have
to keep some

170
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:36,119
promises we made back harvest so we

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,839
Mehldau close to the things we promise
to people actress

172
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,720
build up shirts and stickers some rocks
as well

173
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,300
up enough money actually rocks and

174
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,019
we're announcing our first milestone
here faster which is

175
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:58,019
the the alpha version

176
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:07,209
and where one day you know it's real
stuff for project in every I'll

177
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,510
so what's the outlook for the offer up

178
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,860
highlight of the offer is this is not me
where we act

179
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,940
are Inc software you can download and

180
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,279
a big heart Carter what we're doing is
trying to prove that you can actually

181
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,350
crowd

182
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,529
and it's not a risk so keeping our
promises really important we have

183
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,560
a nice html5-based user interface we
have

184
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,589
fast search engine which is based on
much

185
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:42,270
discussed widely we have

186
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,470
basic support for PGP encryption
signatures it's a bit clunky

187
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,660
its new but it's it's there we have
spent filtering based on

188
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,589
this fan base station filter system and
we have over

189
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,620
30 volunteers translating mail pile into
which we think is just

190
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,830
well-liked

191
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,570
has alleged about highlights is now for

192
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,710
don't expect it to work no expected to
work well

193
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,980
it's tricky to install and configure at
the moment it is still very much for

194
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,860
developers

195
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,220
we don't have I'm at of three support

196
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,700
media reason for that is i happen

197
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,260
we have an answer for you how to store
all that data

198
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,150
because when I think wanna do is make
sure things are starting to put think

199
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,520
about how we do that we don't have
support for s/mime

200
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,660
don't know if anyone cares was on the
list

201
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,030
talk and we still have compelling story

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,949
Howard so handling

203
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,400
he is expiring he's being involved in
all that stuff we need to put you on

204
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,170
that

205
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,839
doesn't killed a normal user that's
going to be tricky

206
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,980
there's lotsa stuff let's work to do
still hit the source code

207
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,930
clone the alpha release and from this
point on we're gonna try to keep that

208
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,199
branch sort of stable for people who
just want to look at it and will

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,470
break shit and make things messy on the
main branch

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,230
we have live demo has one other

211
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,540
wanna the things that we face here's
backed by

212
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,500
three thousand people most of which are
not particularly

213
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,120
so they're not going to be able to
download the source code

214
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,130
so we put some effort into making sure
channels were up so they could see

215
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,939
play no work and of course

216
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,670
makers ought to check them out as well
all

217
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,670
field myself 20

218
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,520
let's see if this website

219
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,720
I'm refreshed

220
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,060
ours I don't know if they've been havent

221
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,579
actually

222
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:12,349
that works so this is the intermission
might going to do

223
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,370
little devil show you what it looks like
and

224
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,370
then I'm gonna go through talking about
some other technical implementation I

225
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,579
may use up all my time and then some

226
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,579
so I'm gonna count on them to stop me
and I will stop selling tix quest

227
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,800
a look well

228
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,800
know enough page

229
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,639
we can try it

230
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,329
for the sys admins in the room running
this on

231
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,790
for UPS's

232
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:01,790
all by favorite author

233
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,790
okay stand tall stack

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,270
well if it doesn't work registering of
local host so that's how we do this is

235
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,779
where the demo is supposed to look like

236
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,300
it's an email client so I could do
anything i click link to this life

237
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,240
this is my personal which using a
different

238
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
I think about it there committed

239
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,219
better I think

240
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,920
pic 2

241
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,689
but they were sacked just I read an
email

242
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,350
read about me development which is kinda
cool so you can read messages

243
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,500
I see my curse there

244
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,210
here's the top we have like on Cesar
going to signify

245
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,210
the stated corruption so whether the
message is signed or accepted

246
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,210
cops up the tooltip to explain what's
going on

247
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,390
this is first draft going to be

248
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,480
improving its interface over time we
have something else

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,930
I can hi

250
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,319
here try tryna crypt

251
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,060
says hair the reason being I don't have
a key for the recipient

252
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,170
see tales for Cassie

253
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,020
Eric try removing Chris key

254
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,710
said hi too slow

255
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:50,670
i still cant crypt

256
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,750
that's a book and less class

257
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,620
owner look there's this other guy here
now it's ok

258
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,340
post to this is what we're trying to do

259
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,630
we're trying to make it really easy when
the AC is

260
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,290
if we know that we have for the person
that we're communicating with people

261
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,579
suggest that the male B

262
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,319
have to fight all and we know that's
gonna cause probs

263
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,829
because a lot of us are using multiple
devices New York

264
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,579
wanna attack so we're also looking at
ways to communicate

265
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,710
preferences issue if we see that we
always kid encrypt email from this

266
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,280
person

267
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,320
probably sign then saved sometimes I get
a message

268
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,919
may be your default policy that's it
dentist

269
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,380
just sign that stuff that we need to
work on

270
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,440
this is a search engine

271
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,240
I could search for Linux

272
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,710
nice France see if

273
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,840
email up so my

274
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,919
mailbox has out 160 1000 messages

275
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,810
and this is running on relatively crappy
laptop with the spinning

276
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:12,810
about fast this is what we're doing
shows tax here

277
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,480
the city's old packed in a box time
trying to show the conversations

278
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,379
filter is only show me the ones I
haven't bothered reading it

279
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,950
so this it's an email

280
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,790
it's making progress we have your
contacts

281
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,800
so right here this is pulling

282
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,899
contact outweigh GPG key chain wanna

283
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,280
historic or ideas we have want to
integrate key management

284
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,600
with contact so this shouldn't really
theater

285
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,899
shouldn't have to go to some separate
application to manage a key

286
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,900
be able else and we are pulling

287
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,600
pictures found avatar through those
images come from would like to for

288
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,040
pictures from other sources

289
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,510
like crap Facebook if we can't that's
gone or

290
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,100
I would be cool

291
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,899
pain the we have on we have various
plugins for importing

292
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,310
so refreshed yes how about hard and

293
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,490
we have various plugins pulling in
contact with the source

294
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,190
we can pull in contacts from the mork
database which is how Thunderbirds

295
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,570
toward

296
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,679
contact and we have a car

297
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,520
I haven't tried it myself but these
things are old

298
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,200
they're all under development to
definitely going to happen you can help

299
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,710
see here's the list

300
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,360
tax case stats

301
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,139
here's where we thank for money keep
working on

302
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,770
these trees and so you money

303
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,440
great so that's that's

304
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,020
I the web interface in a nutshell
because I know I have a rueful techies

305
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,450
here

306
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,920
keyboard shortcuts

307
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,280
not yet the house system at a time

308
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,240
to one thing at a time so the back into
this

309
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,310
is this is written as a search engine
and

310
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,669
every time you hit any it's written as a
REST API

311
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,550
detained in a and point kitty to taste
so we can actually just

312
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,639
request that mister looking at the
impact so this is

313
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,670
the same data allotted actually has all
the information about to search results

314
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,240
visible so it's got the like is the
clubs here

315
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,320
there that actually

316
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,480
thumbnail image

317
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,940
this point that a lot of stuff to
interact with this problematic

318
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,210
we're hoping that will lead to some
interesting replying

319
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:08,200
question

320
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I small he pulled come from somewhere in

321
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,480
I'm gonna rip pastor I felt asleep

322
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,480
frills apparently effect

323
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,670
sugars composer for composer richard is
a reply

324
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,200
so this is what the full composer looks
like it has same interest

325
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,950
choose profiles said sign this message

326
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:49,580
search for people

327
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,689
this is searching searching in my
personal

328
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,770
mister addresses any address the nazis

329
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,920
shows up as suggest

330
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,250
the ones actually have as I said they
get a little awk

331
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,970
hopefully that workers used hours

332
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,310
so sleep cured 0 go

333
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,550
for this here this

334
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,590
is the command line interface

335
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:28,530
help

336
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,200
data plans

337
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,200
commands then search things it is

338
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:52,809
trainers

339
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:55,940
various things that you can do it
relatively art

340
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,490
clever

341
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,140
could you repeat the question

342
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,520
yes

343
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,580
so wanna I'm actually gonna get into
that the moment

344
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,210
for St Pauli males behind locally

345
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,380
and yes we are encouraging people to
store things

346
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,250
one take he sent wanna call

347
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,230
so so yeah I know people want to

348
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,309
think think I'm we just have to go
through how we do that same I'm gonna go

349
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,500
back to my slides

350
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,780
tell you all about the technology this
for some

351
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,020
how to help I'll this is their chance to
runaway

352
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,429
K so the overall architecture

353
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,960
the project the grain principles are
free software

354
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,860
use open standards and we're opponents a
decentralization

355
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,428
so we feel for the user should hold
their own data and we shall

356
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,450
XO searching is a critical feature

357
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,870
it's not enough that people have to
organize all the mail in folders

358
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,649
because even a regular user has
thousands of messages

359
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,510
someone like me has been on the internet
for you know well over a decade

360
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,510
has up

361
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,020
I our menus and faces the web

362
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,510
we're going to allow for alternate ones
as well want to encrypt by the fall

363
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,879
whenever possible and we have the
expectation that our end-users

364
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,400
are not the people in this room their
non-technical people sometimes ask me

365
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,110
cohen right suffer for I would like the
software to be

366
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,399
answer to the question when someone
comes to me and says

367
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,700
I'm worried about my privacy what can I
do because today

368
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,920
we don't have an answer someone comes
and says I want my email

369
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,870
private we're gonna say install
Thunderbird learn to use

370
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,080
Nick male and that kinda hard to and
Thunderbird is pain

371
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,260
so actually in a steamy

372
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,330
not being actively developed getting
into the

373
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,600
called we have I fung core

374
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,659
which is where things like configuration
search engine is part of the core

375
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,050
reading and writing and sending email as
part of the core

376
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,870
crypto used the server and

377
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,000
we have a plugin picture it's not stable
yet

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,290
we do want to be able to tell think
that's what where are you doing so

379
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,330
we support multiple mailbox for months
that's starting to become pluggable

380
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,360
record in contact I said that was
written as a plugin from day one

381
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,000
senator disintegration so when you

382
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,320
install male power new machine and it
goes fine sure

383
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,689
male up setting figures out what

384
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,820
to that would be against the people
right dip different operating systems

385
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,030
and we have plugins that allow you to
take the search engine itself

386
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,290
compete for attention the gym and

387
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,960
create words or to create complex
queries based on something

388
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,830
make sense to you we have a Web API

389
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,980
touched on that briefly in the demo get
things back

390
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,930
state Jason most the URL the people see
in the web browser they mapped directly

391
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,360
to

392
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,939
i semester and hyphen message by default

393
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,530
if you hit as can point which has
changed if

394
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,350
using regular regular interface arrest
him I'll

395
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,389
we also provide HTML and J sandwich

396
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,890
doing a sexist things and just plain
text and

397
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:46,360
we might to XML whatever there's a
demand for the HTML

398
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,810
that we do render is rendered using
ginger to company interface itself

399
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,470
there were using html5 guys

400
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,910
jQuery last all the modern

401
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,470
holes we want to do progressive
enhancement

402
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,100
like site to work without Javascript it
doesn't quite do that yep

403
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,830
you can use in a read-only mode. I and
we want to have a response to design

404
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,139
so it scales different size screen in a
while ices so

405
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,850
because honestly is going to be a while
before someone develops

406
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,080
mail pile for your phone but we want the
web interface to at least

407
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,149
nice in a phone if you expose your mail
pile up

408
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,150
and it will be seen scannable

409
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,900
people what their small tin interfaces
to the a

410
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,320
showed you the command line very briefly
is also

411
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,149
hi honey face cream same mail pile
shemale

412
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,900
instance attract programmatically use
that for testing

413
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,630
could be used for various other weird
things

414
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,990
we might support extra-large PC

415
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,440
because that's really doing Python I
would love it if someone ported to use

416
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,980
interface

417
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,310
much and

418
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,580
details how does it work so I get the
question why are we not

419
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,949
using tax wires all quietly writer on
sort

420
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,200
and the honest answer is because that's
how

421
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,840
start i was just curious can I write
assertion I wanted

422
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,840
and it works it's fast under 600 lines
of code at the moment I don't really

423
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,550
feeling me

424
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,409
checked the other benefit the bank
benefit I C

425
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,930
this is that it's very very simple I can
explain it now

426
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,450
how it works and you understand it and I
consider that to be a huge benefit

427
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,640
I don't have that visibility into calls

428
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,990
we want to do things like want to make
sure this kid people to experience

429
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,810
customized email sure that we're storing
old

430
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,290
data this want to have a lot of control

431
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:02,000
how this so having a simple small Kobe
studio herself is very appealing

432
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,480
and also means we don't have another
dependency surpasses

433
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,190
this ship users how does it work

434
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:15,480
mail polling to mail out in the messages
generate a 94

435
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,680
you expect to meditate like the subject
recipients

436
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,150
percent sizes message and think and it
was tracked a buncha keywords

437
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,400
which thing you can actually search for
when create

438
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,520
posting lists these are basically maps
map

439
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,930
a key skewers to said a message just

440
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,970
very simple files they just have a list

441
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,380
keywords there's a map to slice

442
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,920
and there's a minute into which maps the
same ID

443
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,090
to meditate which tells something about

444
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,250
meditate index is something I store in
brown that was

445
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,770
realizing relating email

446
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,379
was no small enough and our computers
are not powerful enough

447
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,630
like all that data nobody's

448
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,550
that's what started this project cuz we
can do that all the sudden

449
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,510
everything becomes really fast because
most search queries can be answered

450
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,560
well small file reading it and i'm
looking up all the other day

451
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,090
that means I can answer any search query
under 200 milliseconds

452
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,939
on crappy hardware your good hardcore
just get faster

453
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,010
this is how you wouldn't put this issue
writing

454
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,320
call yourself and I'm patient the
message id:

455
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,889
for a given keyword generate a file
named by asking the keyword

456
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:47,100
open it up persist he returns

457
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,780
in reality and grouping from the key
words together will have an infinite

458
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,260
number of files

459
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,810
there are some problems this adding
things easy to beat England

460
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,120
open all the files stuff that messy

461
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,659
the meta-data index it looks like that
it's just a dictionary

462
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,670
ID maps too much about its

463
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,510
what we put in a minute indexes all the
data that weenie

464
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,020
generator so new ask for

465
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,200
search for potato I get back to list
messages

466
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
and i cant find subject lines Sanders

467
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,870
all the details I need to show you the
list I can show you the list in need

468
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,090
and that's that's were that's how we
kiss

469
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,649
good experience when you're searching
meditative worker

470
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,230
restoring kept it on disc GTG

471
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,220
posting lists are not yet equipped but
they will be

472
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,280
so putting those two things together
after five wine searcher

473
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,950
start with all others I message id:

474
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,000
that exist preach keyword

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,310
in the query you narrow down the set

476
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,590
just look at the message id: max that
query when you do a set intersection

477
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,500
then when you've done that for all of
the terms people are searching for

478
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,920
go through the results

479
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,110
that's the core research right

480
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,689
some building on top of this we added

481
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,210
tax which is similar to the labels that
are in Gmail

482
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,300
and these are basically search terms
where you can edit the results

483
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,270
so you can add and remove message ID's
to the skewers and that allows you to

484
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,820
also

485
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,750
think created in box Park certain
messages

486
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,460
unrehearsed whatever

487
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,930
and now we have things to do medically

488
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,010
have filters this allows organizing your
email

489
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,570
structure way plugins

490
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,070
as I mentioned before this allows make
new rules for how to generate

491
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,270
keywords I'm really hoping someone right

492
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:00,210
a plug into parse PDF files and extract
attacks like search

493
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,900
those as well someone could write a
fuckin

494
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,390
understand grammar their language or
understand

495
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,000
particular few specialization

496
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,020
something that parses one thing recalls

497
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,800
our solicitors become Ryanair come from
future

498
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,860
extracting information about the flight
make that in 2006

499
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,209
search keyword a lot of things can be
done

500
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,420
and then there's the other side so it's

501
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,770
viewers increase magic you were there

502
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,600
the way you search for dates is
implemented as likens

503
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,879
you can search for dates arranged and
the 2014

504
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,890
humor but I can create he was outta

505
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,440
that's what this like blacks time to
search for

506
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,290
2010 40 or

507
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,300
and of course plugins can also just use
a search engine to generate interest

508
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,850
views figure out things about me

509
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,040
to give its building a search engine
like this is

510
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,449
mostly to do with actually reading the
mail and

511
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,418
generating useful terms so which few
hours we put in the index

512
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,409
which keywords top and then of course is
the

513
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:23,649
constant optimization fast to

514
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:30,149
works in progress we Anna able to do
anything from searching

515
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,989
limitation fix it

516
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,139
encryption needs work by security people
tell me that it's not good enough as it

517
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,699
is

518
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,439
to be nice to have a better which the
current creaming which is produced

519
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,889
so pas actually people have questions
about the search

520
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,000
if I'm

521
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,300
you have

522
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,310
oh yes yeah a

523
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,110
you those RT scripted and so the
question is how

524
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,200
when we do fuck and the answers

525
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,629
if you tell male pilot out and this has
to be said

526
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,650
is not everyone is comfortable male

527
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,680
I will just keep picturing you know when
it sees index

528
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,009
just like anything else

529
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,240
that's one of the reasons that assertion
that needs to be

530
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,600
kept secure because I I believe

531
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,250
scripted email usable insertion

532
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,450
so this to work in order to do so we
need to be using

533
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,620
trip to search index meta-data

534
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,549
going to do so in a way the content

535
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:53,550
there

536
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,260
but top

537
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:04,260
but yes apps that their

538
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,860
actually if it's not about sex with two
afterwards

539
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:13,190
okay up try at least some time how much
for time

540
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,330
up are ok

541
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,430
well that means let's talk about spam
filtering

542
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,910
school so how does it work

543
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,649
mail pile spam filters are based on
statistical analysis

544
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,360
so we won't have engines read the email
and

545
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,760
K give us some sort by the fall music's
fan base

546
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,880
messages mass are on a tag with for spam

547
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,060
and then messages have that had our
fight for hidden from search results

548
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,630
so stan is it in your face we train

549
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,350
the filter trainee basin engine

550
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,770
by looking at the user

551
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,540
so going in a little deeper statistical
analysis

552
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,920
is trying to answer the question what
spam

553
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,410
because not everyone has the same spam
and not everyone has the same idea about

554
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,279
what is

555
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,870
I we do that by feeding the same
keywords as going to the search engine

556
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,920
into a Bayesian filter and it will then

557
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,880
hopefully he'll classify the mail to
expand or

558
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,460
spam or it's definitely not

559
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,350
by 24 views training is the important
part

560
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,960
if we get this wrong in this battle

561
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,520
this is where we need to work or

562
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,580
know what we're trying to do we're
looking how using tracks with them

563
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,120
so if you take a message dragon sample

564
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,680
pretty clear single thats and if you

565
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,370
read a message and then you reply to it
that's a pretty clear message that

566
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,420
message was not

567
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,100
so we're using things like that to
assemble a corpus

568
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:01,700
messages for training and my vision for
doing this I want to train

569
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,069
Road frequently because I believe that
both your communication patterns

570
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,210
and had spam are going to change over
time

571
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,760
so I not expect your spam filter to
match for spam

572
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,830
two years ago for I would like to mass
spec

573
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,279
to mail pounds tracking the Zacks when
you click on a message

574
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,460
read it that message tag as having

575
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,300
when you reply to all messages taggers
this message was fight

576
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,420
when you manually organize things one
tacked on another

577
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:40,780
fact that is and that allows us to
choose messages for

578
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,040
we also have bacon filters

579
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,150
turns out nothing that I just said it
has anything to do with back

580
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,720
it's just how you organize a man so

581
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,359
what we're interested in doing is using
the exact same plugin

582
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,590
Sachs & Co news and bass as a
general-purpose male

583
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,950
by so you can go to some tax you've just
created

584
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,080
fosston anything just Creek

585
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,549
and then over time put some messages in
that time

586
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,950
haven't other messages and bill how
should be able to learn

587
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:22,430
which messages belonging to the pasta I
can do that for you

588
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,180
works its cool

589
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,770
yes think I am

590
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:38,770
but cycles for one more was kinda long 1
okay yeah

591
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:45,369
did anyone want to ask about stamp yes

592
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:52,369
so the question is whether vases

593
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,290
actually good enough on its own and

594
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,089
raise questions weather will be able to
compete with people like Google

595
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,910
have access to lots of other people's
mail can cross-correlation

596
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,319
time top by people

597
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,640
exploded has been using Thunderbird its
be

598
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,098
settled for a while his happy but this
is an area where I do expect

599
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,750
recalling Hillary develop if necessary

600
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,260
it might be interesting to look into
ways users can collaborate and share

601
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,130
tales in a decentralized I mean that's
the big handley

602
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:50,530
project not quite proud yet this is this
is a valid question and I don't really

603
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:57,530
have what

604
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,640
if Spanish stocks GPG scripting spam
emails

605
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,040
and then you will be able to spam
filtering

606
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,859
him so

607
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:13,290
I think we're asking is what happens
when spammer start cooking a male

608
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,500
at that point that point we went because
that point Google

609
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,569
filter it but we can because we're doing
spam processing after the mail

610
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:25,880
script so that's one of the reasons in
an encrypted

611
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,930
world need to move the spam filter out
yes just where

612
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:35,930
just administrator

613
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,490
sometimes receive made for by uses get
frightened by spam

614
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,509
water whole house share activists so

615
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:49,010
forest always occasional have yes

616
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,460
what is this get us through

617
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,500
what that actually means is the data

618
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,250
interesting message on the odds are that
users going to for that

619
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,609
you also benefited and that means I have
a very strong single

620
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:09,390
that was expect and you know I'm
perfectly happy with works

621
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,078
both on move along

622
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:20,079
talk about crypto as one up a

623
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,520
you asking how can a friend of yours
benefit from your

624
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,180
country I'm not sure I'm not sure the

625
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,060
depends on whether your spam is similar
enough and

626
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,170
one other things that we need to look
into before we ship this

627
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:41,160
is whether there's value to building
assorted generic

628
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,379
pre-training shipping and then have
another

629
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,430
overtime how we would do that's that's
something that we don't even some till

630
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,960
next summer

631
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,270
it's a it's a good question so

632
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,119
crypto where should we do crypto

633
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,569
like I say we do because it's not all
into but this is what we're talking

634
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:03,980
about

635
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,260
we want today to address so every

636
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,200
all the data mail pile generates should
be stored in a safe

637
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,259
I know some people have full description

638
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,839
but not everyone does I would like
people to build

639
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,940
mail piles on USB sticks and just carry
them around there's there's many reasons

640
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,130
for doing this

641
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,510
reason crypto

642
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,520
when we're reading writing and sending
mail using it

643
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,200
yes obviously wherever appropriate we
would like to an online is

644
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,410
communication with the external network
so when you when they'll

645
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,868
how goes up and down those images from
Avatar it shouldn't really be telling

646
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:44,720
Gravatar

647
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,899
I am talking to these people is to be
anonymized in some way

648
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,630
and we might want to implement some
other proof

649
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,660
work past which relates to what the
other

650
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,790
kryptonite so data at rest

651
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,650
strategy their is to just chill out to
the existing tools

652
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,099
use CPG binary so fine or

653
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:13,549
wrapper library and use that

654
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:18,740
crips basically everything application
settings contact surgeon Exeter

655
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,990
using GPG is relatively slow

656
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,629
so probably only going to use that file

657
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,920
that will then contain a key that is
used for symmetric encryption

658
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,040
the openness so because ok cell

659
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,819
yes corruption is quite first

660
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:43,900
I reading email well as the basics you
parse

661
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,040
the PGP mine call out to TPG

662
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,400
check with the signature checks I'll
things as necessary

663
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,700
I'll but we would like

664
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,730
feels like another thing like you plug
in other could persist

665
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,270
because the could the community is is
developing all these things and

666
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,859
I don't sure they have from what next

667
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,869
I would like to view the plugin
punishment staff

668
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:12,440
rosalee coltie free bad price

669
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,339
face on it occurs but a similar thing
PG&E called

670
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,359
play as

671
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:24,609
man as answer the question decreasing
can be done during indexing

672
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:27,810
face cryptic messages can be searched

673
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,660
and when we do that that means the we
follow up information about the state of

674
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,589
the messages

675
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:37,970
into the meditator ok so you can search
for messages

676
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:44,310
bad signatures or the UI cue physical
feedback because everything the US shows

677
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,250
is based on what's in a minute X

678
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,619
so that's that's important coming that

679
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,000
is mostly working as a as this month

680
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,640
writing email again generate pgp mine

681
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,480
use TPT to actually do the signing and
encrypting

682
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,490
we want to do best effort to church we
would like to encrypt messages whenever

683
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,319
we can

684
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,900
how we figure out what we can kind of
question

685
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,319
would like to cite signed by falters
really no reason not to

686
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,619
and we'll me to give users the power to
change the settings

687
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,049
but the most part we want to do our best

688
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,810
we would like to use trust on first use

689
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,470
tofu for key verification were so that's
like

690
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,930
SSH where the first time we see the key
to say okay this is probably the Ricky

691
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,089
in

692
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:42,180
you only complaint change picture

693
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,328
this is because the weather trust is
very complicated

694
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:49,910
I'm not sure we can put a user interface
to be on

695
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,359
and whether trustees also leaking

696
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,460
private information whether trust is
revealing

697
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,819
anyone who cares look who's talking to
whom

698
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:05,450
who knows PowerConnect and a lot of
people consider that to be such a

699
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,660
massive pose a problem

700
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,220
that it should use so this is

701
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:14,410
however having right now welcome to talk
about it

702
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,480
for the feedback but this is what we're
talking about

703
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,500
and probably going to string cheese an
ad hoc way

704
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,740
including hatching

705
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,729
sending from we should use TLS

706
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,390
when possible that's been innocent
forever obviously we should use it

707
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,890
we also have this idea assent or

708
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:42,490
SMTP overt or this is where male
pulsar's because

709
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,859
else bill very simplicity

710
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:50,290
the server in the mail we ship male
pilot or together

711
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,950
so an end user installs male while they
also get or

712
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,589
people or Taurus K

713
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:03,319
it's an anonymity talk and on my sis
communications

714
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:06,779
and it's also a dark so you can register

715
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:09,790
what's called a hidden service on or
people

716
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,920
connected to the anonymity of that

717
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,099
strong but what this means you

718
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:21,210
get an email address which looks really
ugly its your name

719
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,330
some long gibberish tree very helpfully

720
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,680
Maple Street longer recently

721
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,609
characters something and

722
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,130
but but mean is when your mail

723
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:40,770
hose connected or one male pal can
deliver emailed directly to another

724
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,869
doesn't have to go through any outside
relays

725
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:47,040
never the the encrypt it or network and

726
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,369
we have suddenly closed medically

727
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:53,670
people are complaining about with SMTP
where

728
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,700
the NSA is just listening to who is
sending messages on

729
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,950
is a lot of the time that happens in the
clear this is a different problem

730
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,810
from the latter encryption message
headers and p2p

731
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,890
the actual I sent dial weeks no

732
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,089
mail from somebody RCPT to

733
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:16,690
somebody else that's always in the clear
in this people use it till SAT let's not

734
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,160
wide

735
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,879
ploy widely deployed

736
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,390
to this closes at least completely and
it allows emails

737
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,430
suddenly become appeared here messaging
protocol

738
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,299
how diligent protocols we don't
inundating

739
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:35,750
just assemble things so

740
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,890
by building on SMTP instant think some
protocol that means we can use the

741
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,080
existing infrastructure

742
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,080
you something like post pics accident or
something but an inservice instead

743
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,650
and do remain if your mail pile is not
online often enough for the

744
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,490
question about

745
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,549
I have no idea start will

746
00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:03,270
are the question waters are doing
development

747
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,690
from what I've for dark male are doing
something clever

748
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,470
where XMPP which it up so in my mind
that's not really

749
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,540
I don't know if they find backwards
compatibility backwards compatible with

750
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,049
the world

751
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:20,460
email a bill to tap dance I'd

752
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,240
if they publish something we might limp

753
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,819
if it's good Muslim we just have to wait
and see

754
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:33,270
I think this is my last trip just like
yes

755
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,220
suks that's a no brainer we should be
using all the time

756
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,939
and I would like to anonymized traffic
by shipping with or

757
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,950
we can start downloading Gravatar
download Facebook

758
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,750
here and there without revealing

759
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,319
and in some cases we will actually also
be able to an anonymized

760
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,529
X there are fighters like gmail

761
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:59,740
when I think they did really well they
explicitly allow incoming connections

762
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,109
from

763
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,730
and they do this because they want
activist

764
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,290
there are some providers known to be
well and we should be able to connect

765
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,080
them all

766
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,490
or static void

767
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:20,490
so thats it for me yea we have an offer

768
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,319
and it takes more questions

769
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,530
we have some more questions

770
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,090
countires his hands up

771
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,970
so I can have the microphone movements
like people running away altogether

772
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:40,470
part
