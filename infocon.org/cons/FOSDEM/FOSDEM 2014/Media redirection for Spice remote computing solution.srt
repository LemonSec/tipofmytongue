1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:05,810
hello everyone ayala

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,390
that are left off and today we are going
to talk about to

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,220
and major erection and then we'll

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,189
on your project me lunch for optimizing
the

5
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,569
image us in processing your for the
Mitchell desktop infrastructures

6
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:26,460
so there's a kinda for in the middle
where

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,839
of for different technologists

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,030
a for virtualization layer

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,579
at and major process still and also

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,780
a remote camp you tell ok or different
kinds

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,070
so the

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,170
if you are it's about us so we have just
started this project

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,609
and is really a new that currently there
is a team of 30 they'll birth

14
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,649
the 10 them at it's me

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,050
as the waters working on mir helping it
today

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,789
also that thing here he's not here so

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,960
the brought up this cause that'd get up
you go

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,330
see id and that near

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,220
their work is sponsored by oppression
company her

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,370
mere so

21
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,420
it probably ok I never thought about
that company

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,860
but if you are just give us so this is
the

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,080
special software and the services
company quite a bit

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,429
as you can see and so is

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,650
that rely on services for wireless
company also has also

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,650
if any questions if and ask me okay

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,210
so and it will be talking about to

28
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,399
major processing and your child is
stopping to understand how to optimize

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,320
them so

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,589
just a Foley want to show the we wanted
her

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,780
identify what we are talking about so
use cases for major but they still

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,040
possible that is it waiting in plane of
local media content

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,260
and the 2nd Planned or further his case
is a remote major content

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:12,210
like use our planet we do from mutual
the next one is that telecommunications

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,620
is really important and did

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,750
fiery different from the other so we'll
be focusing on the last saw

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,380
the first one is covered by different
technologies such as can never mentioned

38
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,990
them later

39
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,070
but me know the folks that on the a
multimedia playback and two

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,890
telecommunications it

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,750
and then and want to give your short
overview love their

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,260
without space at me and I'll be talking
about it had spies because it is the

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,380
most prominent a

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,930
open source a.m. on this the little the
stopper

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,970
actual display solution I would say the

46
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,290
other a ritual this place like the Aesir
and

47
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,319
probably and X a landing

48
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,790
author probably can be covered title
there stocking

49
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,230
about spice today so business calls
question is there

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,549
there walking this system is based on
the

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,690
hypervisor Linux KVM

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,230
the which'll machinists a run in

53
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,390
%um you know the

54
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,579
spice this error is running a set as a
and the red the spice company in special

55
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,520
by sarah is running the coincide

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,459
the context of the official Michele and
expose

57
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,700
itself to this bicycle and shit

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,810
connected to us by surprise local so I
love us also there is a spice agent that

59
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,130
the

60
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,900
guest and the summer virtual drive
arsenault like

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,290
who excel for enhanced the media

62
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,760
opening has to be diverse so

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,260
a

64
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,310
so

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,480
let's look how the play but fair in most
major

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,980
happens in the day and what problems we
can see here

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,030
so here we see they were shown a shame
and the

68
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,920
simple and made a play runs down there
with a mid-engine Cumberland highlighted

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,238
rent so any user wants to play a
two-mile

70
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,298
his initial mission at tennis the

71
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,330
earlier issued a bit the the player
connects and

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,498
the major is late locally by that Blair
and

73
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,610
the help lead to call it say into their

74
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,039
the ritual de y sus and writers

75
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,120
they handle them will handle it and get
it to the spice ever-present in college

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,180
thing once again

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,279
as of this happen said the cost and the
media then transfer to other spice

78
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,879
channel

79
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,969
to that spice plantains that course
again

80
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:48,680
and to call it and played out so
obviously that is not the

81
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,289
very efficient next one is even

82
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,419
watched it is it yes the what the system
and that

83
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,808
me every day so if we just install a
softball

84
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,849
individual Michelle have so wat the
system

85
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,849
like seep proxy or whatever them there

86
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:11,270
we can see that media is not et cetera
and a

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,859
your to appear anymore it is straight
into major engine

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,979
and their children their mission and
then again

89
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:23,258
is transported and the same and by many
it will be about this the

90
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,259
from the there about the direction from
the

91
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,839
microphone on this the client and then
it is

92
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,639
going in the opposite direction it is
also known optimal

93
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,819
so we go hip have led Karen pulling
problem

94
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,889
here so there if sometimes called have
been in effect

95
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,059
some maybe a stance that button through
that traditional sever

96
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:50,809
not peer to peer and also this the
things that transported to the sever

97
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,189
just got it can be allowed to just the
it

98
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,099
increases ACP lawton to listen to what
degree the VM density of this

99
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,539
a a positions there but at

100
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,869
there the main part is that theme sup
walking through there so they should

101
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:07,550
sever so

102
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,949
did that network a lot and most the

103
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,050
washed effect is increased blessing test
literacy jeeter

104
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,139
and maybe packet loss if this networks
and reliable

105
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,759
so if for example the official this
first-ever the clan tens

106
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,210
they're far and all that allocated and
different

107
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,650
their places for few and hundreds of
kilometres

108
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,748
way of each other this is this becomes
very ineffective and

109
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:39,150
for example what the social service
support him

110
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,539
PSR

111
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,219
how this a situation is that just
sexually

112
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:50,599
so there this is a well-known problem
for list more I think I S

113
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,369
and there are custom solutions amo so
they'll

114
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:57,999
as I aware of their proprietary
solutions

115
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,649
and a little want to name the here
doesn't really matter

116
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,719
so this is a general scheme offer such

117
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:07,998
solution my and white you endorse

118
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:11,360
so they in introduces to a soft forms

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,129
one in that class said another one and
the guess

120
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,399
so the guest one it is shown to the user
and pro-life user interface

121
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,279
that client the one in that chick and in
all their thinking and the media

122
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,499
and they are at the pigment in say in
their

123
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:34,080
yes the FTP that but wassup softball so
I kept saying colonized

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,270
the some kind of CGI computer telephone
interface

125
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,289
and so

126
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,229
nets is there there usually proprietor

127
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,818
system and that is when a custom within
it is not general

128
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,099
and that's why we want to enjoy yourself
in

129
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:58,330
different that is that made me do a
directional concept

130
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,389
sauce you can seem here

131
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,439
and this is the displayed for the why
appear

132
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,499
case but for now though with no major

133
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:10,659
media player it is the thing so

134
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,039
as you can see here we introduce the

135
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,659
it media engine stops for the softball

136
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,719
and if mid-engine stamps implement the
that

137
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:24,369
API but then what they actually made
engine but

138
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:28,379
use in it ever some kind of RPC client

139
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,529
which is then that sales this control

140
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,779
rather control from a show do that
missus service located at the quaint

141
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,809
the they taste them to your YouTube
channel

142
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,478
the inside the spice protocol for this
case

143
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,660
or if it is not spy cell phone of

144
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,699
can be used so

145
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,899
and the actual midget media engine is
like a tad the

146
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,660
at client there is that a company
controlled by the

147
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,180
up to see it Sirius and the media bosses

148
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,269
YouTube you again so this is this
additionally it

149
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,829
we propose for and this their

150
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,979
problems and

151
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,220
if you what's about media here so we do
is the company more complicated

152
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,110
then all your because the because we
need to

153
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,699
display the media on top of for on top
of the

154
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,709
Mitchell going up a for

155
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,430
on the spice planned for this case so
for this

156
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,849
casing is some kind of %uh earlier and
there are API and the client

157
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,399
it is that while kind of solution
probably there are different based in

158
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:39,829
bed

159
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,969
the output of the local we do. into this

160
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,680
there under this virtuales Graham

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,170
so this the this game

162
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,139
shells fell can be done and general

163
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,279
so so what's the what is done now

164
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,579
it does what that was on the concept but
now

165
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,769
really wanted to show you that what
we're have

166
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,069
now so far basically be have to approve
of concepts

167
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,979
for by this first one called prototype a

168
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,899
it is there audio player

169
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,889
and basic ill audio player hair

170
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,720
from just three more runs out basically
a global problem just say we're

171
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,819
a for FN love is just a mariel I'll
probably know that

172
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,979
there are there is high-level played
play blak

173
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,980
so how don't buy that so this is a

174
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,410
APA like great they play male

175
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,420
and and attach it who

176
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,729
message can therefore for the muscle
that play mail and

177
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,519
also set properties so that they be like
you right

178
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,930
this is that was implemented and that
just a messed up the

179
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,699
lame elaborate paper that lever which is
then kindly arts this course

180
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,180
the bus goals

181
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,739
so at the fair was side from that class
I

182
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,279
as a we are used in there now the a
reach around

183
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
set GFT this is that

184
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,300
as a simple fire simple just email the
bus them up

185
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,199
yet it was it is partly alt a

186
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,699
return the model actually and the
dissolved the

187
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:29,089
into account it doesn't supported
related just Taylor

188
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,329
it is only a a all that down just a
member

189
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,040
sewing it though departed when you want

190
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,349
probably but for now I think it will
still this high-level like this and that

191
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,060
and that is that the bus them out me
know thirty implemented

192
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,089
gave me or so effectively want to be
fair bit and Kevin

193
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,029
at audio player which can be it built
from the same source that can be linked

194
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,509
to bizarre is that

195
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,089
local just a minute elaborate or via is
this just a mere stops

196
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,120
and work in this environment as the
disowned

197
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,959
so do buses used here for arpa CEO

198
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,979
it is there millet controversial I would
say

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,759
and the there are multiple consoles
about the bus

200
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,329
but multiple pro and contra against it

201
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,449
so for now or it is not a product
summerall hello

202
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,649
so integrationist by six have been
implemented yet

203
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,209
so yeah isn't simple display circuit so
the guest

204
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,619
30 per the click here great this special

205
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,629
the bus bus the

206
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,480
yet the CPM not to be a UNIX sockets

207
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,029
and connect their local service to it
and

208
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,610
hopeful that we will show that in the
demo and as a prototype

209
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,439
be it is a softball it is not too a
full-featured software to the demo day

210
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,189
long lists of

211
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:53,310
for reach it doesn't actually

212
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,750
do anything they'll it is very simple
FTP

213
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,800
RTP stream in this of all I L and

214
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,310
the book here the is not using just the
middle

215
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,180
it is based on the will be about 50 a.m.
Charl

216
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,699
low level at are low-level me and media
engine APIs

217
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,758
if they are family live in them there

218
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,009
there far too good for implementing so
far sub-zero

219
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:23,670
her so and that softball is kinda

220
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,490
similar to that a although player it
kenna

221
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,360
it works does the same it can be link it
to local it

222
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,189
we as the or meanwhile in from the same
source and can be built into iOS

223
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:40,230
local locally about to see it made angel

224
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,470
or can be linked to me is that this
stops

225
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,430
we show implemented in this case the
employment at the usual a fresh to Def

226
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,229
the

227
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,620
their PC system is that

228
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,050
another way mister dove the bus we can
use that period

229
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,209
and it has the some

230
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,290
the go to the sides like being
independent of all this the bus

231
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,449
papal desktop for things happening now

232
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:10,758
have so we can control this
infrastructure for

233
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,189
oh yes cases but it like species like a
don't have seen of

234
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:17,279
doesn't have much less emphasis at in
this sort of

235
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,990
for doesn't help for kind of a bust so
terror

236
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,709
so it is a limited but it is the

237
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,619
really good for that proof of awesome
because a it

238
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,839
is capable of generating and all the
glue

239
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,509
court and we we just need to though

240
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:41,089
had you would say at file describing our
services and we get there

241
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,399
call their PC it starbuck and use it
just thinking and their

242
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,569
calls sore

243
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,949
I'm going to show you how it works
probably a

244
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:56,878
candid but somewhere interesting but

245
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,699
gore and went to help it this

246
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,719
so

247
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,649
we are going to show you look all this
stuff for walks

248
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,269
here or all too

249
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:23,269
to show you there the your solution

250
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,300
so are the local machine a star there to

251
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Severus that up

252
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:09,059
so I started to the so basically what we
care for it want to see if ever

253
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,419
and basically a place that all of the
client and the

254
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,639
the cost because the I don't have my
checkbook written here

255
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,889
and saw it it if there is a Michelle
Michelle Ryan

256
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:28,889
and I'm going to start

257
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,170
for I'm going to start the

258
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,189
them all too often on that softball

259
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,569
just because there is a simple test
tonight but

260
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,469
what we can see here it this capable of
selecting the

261
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,850
claim such a glance oh the wife's

262
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,579
not help much love them day so

263
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,780
it it is capable of playing example
plane and distort

264
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,859
at this time there michael foale example

265
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,530
all doesn't

266
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,789
out yeah have the microphone mute it
because because for them that's

267
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:27,520
the stuff they would

268
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,168
like so whole year

269
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,150
the test works also and it is actually
working there

270
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:42,330
and we had that three if the Pacifico

271
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,780
it is not the it is it doesn't have any
major local if so we can

272
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,418
even start for example

273
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:53,789
all sorry

274
00:17:53,789 --> 00:18:00,789
blow

275
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,730
just add the non-system monitor went to
see the network usage the

276
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,340
you see that is parent the Euro
basically a

277
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,949
so if we're or with worn out

278
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,380
want to make the call sir

279
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,380
up

280
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,010
so to make a call we need to ensure the

281
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,100
a bit pointer isn't said

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,429
some reason K

283
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:50,370
so you have a local were written at work
here between two

284
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:57,370
laptops one is here

285
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,470
so

286
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,019
war

287
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,429
yet works and you can see that

288
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:25,429
there is no all Surrey

289
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,090
so this

290
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,209
humanistic continues but is it's just so
do is

291
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,870
muted but if you look here there's the
where low

292
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,030
threat the network usage actually a it
is not too that

293
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,860
I'll just email his the actually
something different happening here

294
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,479
so that to oh this team is just a little
lol

295
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,820
the it is about to kilobytes per second
actually

296
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:56,820
so if they open their local and the
client you can actually see it

297
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,700
that went ok yes she's here

298
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,820
about

299
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,570
till killer were both their second so

300
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,909
what this notice that

301
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,270
how this or seven basically it

302
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,830
the same finger works for

303
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,250
how the playwright don't think and to
show it a

304
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,530
all this code is available in there it
happens story

305
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,790
again checked out thinking or

306
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:40,790
so will continue is

307
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,840
okay so without our know next steps

308
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,500
so can't leave it there for two d'amore
them on their

309
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,130
applications many we are going to

310
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,390
integrate them to spice is the next
major step

311
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,880
and also her and accept there would be a

312
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,130
integrating with them real-world
although player

313
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,270
this team embraced and then

314
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,990
cell I lost softball a for example

315
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,070
probably didn't little goal this that it
but it

316
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,020
the framework and so far is based on it

317
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,160
it is always did d-bus develops or
probably would not need to

318
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,660
do all this stuff for is our all there

319
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,080
what is open to mention and stabs
problem

320
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,449
also there is the possibility to explore

321
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,480
the member to see a in the browser's

322
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,929
so that that is the Hurriyat kinda dark
matter here

323
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,929
and also of course we need to work on
the major part

324
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:54,300
discard their because his 3d overlay and
is that

325
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,830
some next steps and also country they're
focusing on Linux the links that

326
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,010
communication us

327
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,110
and this case might it is feasible to
that they had that

328
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:11,110
enjoy it for class and windows for class
and guests

329
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,929
her okay so there the can know from

330
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:24,870
question of architecture questions I
would like to

331
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,350
rise because if you haven't decided on
them he attempts

332
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,539
the any input would be welcome and then
kindness

333
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,620
about this so we're

334
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,139
the government to decide at the bar on
the PC system

335
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:42,389
so would doing it to use the bus in this
case or doing it

336
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:46,209
38 and over made it can always both but

337
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,929
it is expensive me ask small and to be a
workin

338
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:55,950
I saw in tears now just slightly
sponsored so

339
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,419
and another question is the

340
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,519
what back against the support a step is
just the right by there a

341
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,879
either like a real see a rolling into

342
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:10,469
look into it as well don't have any
experience with it

343
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,429
not sure whether to MEPS into this so
for just a minute

344
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,450
actually a makes maps bi-level because

345
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,019
at the high-level IPA the actual
implementation

346
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,100
all that pipelines and so on happens to
the

347
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,529
said the class said handed controlling

348
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,370
that a just email me at the bus works
fine

349
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,229
not January much traffic

350
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,559
another topic to discuss that is

351
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,200
by API for need additional mutual
channels

352
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,350
so basically spice allow said the no

353
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,678
new channels but it till identify

354
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,080
what chance do in it and what interfaces
at gust

355
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,408
operating system it Missy that we need
this this said

356
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,100
lamp liberia but the class that it is
not clear

357
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,570
yet and author how they're living in a

358
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,689
API it is another opened up has a

359
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,269
a huge at pick it is that fault though
there are

360
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:15,639
them the saw all canon of the disconnect

361
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:20,100
and precious it is I'll it witness the
beer

362
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,730
and it somehow can't leave to go with
the bus the weekend

363
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,139
have a CS serious stab as a guest which
will take over there

364
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:31,649
a real at class sites ever seen a case
of

365
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,879
disconnect and then application for

366
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:38,529
made media application I'll use that
stuff instead and

367
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:42,350
appropriate is the way to go at least if
the goal is

368
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,529
at the bus and also a couple of other

369
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,210
questions like koresh recovery of the
media engine

370
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,909
where koresh's it probably need to keep
it in separate process

371
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,909
but then how we can launch the

372
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,330
organize their ending up the video into
their

373
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,980
at window life another process it is

374
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,869
also good question so

375
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:12,590
want to conclude what they have done so
far

376
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,889
so there is a problem for

377
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,320
in the everyday is the make me depressed
they still and that

378
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,299
wires said officials my they are not
Idell

379
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,970
and what we the one

380
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,840
we we have introduced it concept call 02

381
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,740
redirect media in using that

382
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,889
to open source components are indelible

383
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:41,350
and to for their apps we have

384
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,949
if so only one but the other one is also
working to go

385
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,419
so what if if for a range still so

386
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:56,419
that's all Wessels

387
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,428
okay

388
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:11,530
if rare questions we can talk outside of
course

389
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,379
here
