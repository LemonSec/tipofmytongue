1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:03,679
ago tho I suggest that we

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,959
get started over one my name is the

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,190
along of a movie about I'm living the

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,428
isolation skidding theme for the past
two years

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,279
been in another 45 feel arm

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,789
and we're going to talk today about
possible engine or

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,609
as we call it chicken-and-egg and will
soon understand why

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,630
these are things that

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,440
I'll we've gone to cover and if you have
any questions

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,540
the key p.m. so that stuff but the main
thing I would start with

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,920
with regards to both then gym is the
fundamental question the fundamental

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,070
question for us

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,969
was why did the chicken cross the road

14
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,530
this is something worth thinking about
about or try to understand why do we

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,160
need the check and took off the whole

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,099
through the real philosophical stuff was
a problem no and within

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,750
we couldn't come up with the right
answer in that context

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,360
so and one has an ideal why did the
chicken cross the road

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,320
and one sorry nice

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,320
but no anyone else

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,810
sorry

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,990
okay so I hope that by the end of the
session we're

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,789
we will be a able to answer this
question so

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,240
up without will host a dent in this
problem a stunning what is hosted engine

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,750
all so we would like to use a stun the

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,140
over installation but we need that
installation to happen

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,680
inside virtual machine okay

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,890
that filter machine has to be highly
visible so we won't lose it

29
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,320
in Kosovo's Hoth coach the problem is
that

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,660
that yeah he's managed by the
application it is hosting

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,580
that filter so that's

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,090
chicken that problem and you probably
know the drawing

33
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,120
and if you know initial many more

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,820
so what that's hosted engine but

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,519
why the real why do we really needed so

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,780
the answer is very simple saw about
money

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,050
it saves money and if you have failover
equipment

38
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,970
special equipment it would serve you a
lot of money so

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,600
that there is a behind it okay but as
you know nothing comes for free

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,440
for free are was will try to implement
that

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,700
we worked it looking into some serious
joins us

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,040
good so to begin with we had the whole
chicken and the egg stuff how do we end

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,549
up in a situation that the VM is running
an application that these

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,720
morning following and complying that
same VM that

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,359
quite a bit of a headache which we

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,270
had to handle with and with soon see how
exactly we sold

47
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,160
so that was the first part but then one
setup is done

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,470
we need to make the VM highly available
many

49
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,970
show that a we and the net for

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,350
in case of network connectivity loss up

51
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,620
handle also bob is we have in life is a
former

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,760
no life was very hard in the data center

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,829
so we need to be able to handle
unexpected things

54
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,070
as much as we can to load balancing
maintenance

55
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,640
everything we need to do with a stand-up
equipment will have to do

56
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,040
but as you can see it's a bit more spent
or bit more

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,260
complicated so when looking at these
issues and understanding what's

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,489
the lights or the possible way to do it

59
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,989
we will trying to look for existing
solutions so

60
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,130
let's take a look at what we know so

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,250
so I love you are probably familiar with
the the Royals

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,440
on costly 5 system the

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,910
only a small problem with that by that
we will continue with that

64
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,630
so that's one thing the other option is
a

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,738
we have mister that has all its yes or
whether

66
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,858
high visibility is a call today the
another option

67
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,950
using pacemaker the the heaviest on the
filesystem

68
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,130
a the use the co think for the call

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,430
and lovely a its limiting you

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,530
to a specific amount though knoweth you
can text and beyond that

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,719
and there's no real a over notable which
is something the freemen

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,270
almost over I'll most %uh values elected

73
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,270
use over notes so

74
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,560
this is how it started this is the
market all

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,380
the available solutions as we saw them
we said okay let's

76
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,210
try to think a little bit more about
that good

77
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,560
let's try to consider stonov filesystem
notable by the what

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,970
all and go for some local Isis Sun ok

79
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,780
I don't have a special flight on its so
basically it's the locking mechanism

80
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,349
was developed by the powerful the over

81
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,540
community project to anything labels us
to

82
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,460
provide missus for this soulful p.m. K

83
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,810
so we were saying let's make sure that
some local voters the locking mechanism

84
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,590
and we will walk with a fistful other fi
systems

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,070
that should bring us into something
which is

86
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,300
simple enough K open source

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,850
so that should be the first thing opus
of simple enough

88
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,599
it focused in virtual machines for those
not over

89
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,360
lot of logic behind it like the other
solutions because they would like to

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,919
provide high visibility for other
resources and entities as well

91
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,990
so thats pretty much focusing on exactly
what we need

92
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,389
so it's much simpler should be easier to
implement

93
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,780
so

94
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,340
with this concept in mind we decided to
go

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,330
and start looking the architect we had
several discussions

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,389
a the architect at one point was too
complicated so we decided

97
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,879
simplify things go for stand-up

98
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,479
real ale classic Architektur everyone
you will have you are

99
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,150
business logic data layer so

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,580
you know case we have feel i Linux

101
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,818
I we have a Orrville HA

102
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,159
agent okay in with some see exactly what
each of them

103
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:44,090
he's doing then we have the over there
is able

104
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,549
the vocab is is collecting of those
shilts told

105
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,909
that's it burst into a conflict

106
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,879
so let's start over into it starting
with the sale I'm not going to resolve

107
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,310
that

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,400
that's I'll something you can actually
do with the simple month minus

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,799
help but in general the CIA's village

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,930
give you the whole VM life cycles and
even more

111
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,069
any stores related functionality that we
need

112
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,710
I'll see that to sleep both

113
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,180
possible changes anything else its very
basically nobody

114
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,949
the Knox and it gives you all the
functionality

115
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,439
the tune in in the beginning are
including maintenance support

116
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,199
as we will both recovery on so

117
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,590
nothing really I mean it's not rocket
science basic Cielo which will give you

118
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,719
all the functionality

119
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,419
that in moving to the next level

120
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,650
we have the Hahm okay

121
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,919
well as we call it the brain basically
that's the compliment

122
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,109
have the state machines the logic
everything that is related to high

123
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,960
visibility

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,919
for the latest on the all system service

125
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,359
okay concussion burn we have another one
that will make sure that

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,379
we will handle this situation okay and
if something wrong happens to the VM

127
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,710
that but model will take action

128
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,938
either least out the vietnam or migrated

129
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:17,699
something else but from the station that
is relevant to that situation

130
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,050
okay you know the to on get the
information

131
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,759
and a connect to the storage we have
another low

132
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,819
to the next one the lol and that's the a
table

133
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,120
so the a table curled a middleman is
basically an

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,010
the media player between the logic and
the actual data

135
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,968
to standalone service organic concussion
burn with another one as a backup

136
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,770
K I'll we use show tho its

137
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,230
so this is actually connecting to the
store its lighting

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,210
and updated and moving form specific
areas in the stalled

139
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,960
and we will soon see exactly what we're
doing in the store

140
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,460
so that's the storage box and with the
growth hormone it going

141
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,500
so its it has a very nice pluggable

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,980
I'll architectural so you can actually
create your own

143
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,780
morning throwing compliments basically
it's most groups like a pink slip

144
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,020
or something else like panel SNMP

145
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,490
that should report back and give us some
sort of indication

146
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,740
so if you want to ping the gateway for
example

147
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,920
we have a very small script that is
doing that takes is an argument

148
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,219
a gateway I feel less and it returns

149
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,150
2004 basically whether we have pink to
the Gateway

150
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,270
on the same goes for seculow and three
others

151
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,710
more bill in morning tools that we have
but going for

152
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,770
as you can see this as possible so you
can have you all

153
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,730
and one day we should be able to support

154
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,490
other state a VM both we can actually
have

155
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,910
be able to monitor or other
characteristics

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,170
other attributes via based on the VM
content

157
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,139
so that about morning going I'll

158
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,760
did the purpose of monitoring is to be
able to provide this information and

159
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,189
then

160
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,350
the logic about which is the agent

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,600
should be able to calculate the
situation

162
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,790
and understand what should be done so

163
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,459
for that purpose game we made up some
thought

164
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,768
the small system that is scoring a host

165
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,089
based on the moment on result that we
got

166
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,910
so those overly a it's a very simple
mechanism which is beat was

167
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,180
basically every beat is telling us
whether it's a

168
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,399
being issue or gate with the issue or
anything else

169
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,529
up we end up with us go and this caller
presents

170
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,339
the whole earth so in this way it's very
using

171
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,730
to get a number and that number a prism

172
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,019
the hosts who could really feel to on VM
which is

173
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,410
I liver posted and in this case

174
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,219
and then all we need to do is compare
every to host which is rather simple

175
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,940
the bigger one will be the battle

176
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,000
so thats going

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,630
a looking into stolen so the thought is
a bit tricky because

178
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,670
as understand this is the part where we
think on eyes

179
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,939
all the host all the holes should be
able to read the same information

180
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,230
and act upon it okay and we should be
able to understand

181
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll what happens if hold disconnects on
the storage

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,560
or crushes or something else happens
let's say that

183
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,040
services that for example okay

184
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,899
so what happens is that we create a
special storage domain

185
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,040
okay in the show tho its we only could
once

186
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,980
during the installation of first node
okay

187
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,199
arm that though the main will end up

188
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,529
holding the the hosted in discs

189
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,670
okay and to with a specific file in NFS
at five

190
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,079
going forward in other of those types be
just

191
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,689
areas blocks okay so we have a son a
comment that they too far

192
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,190
and we have the agent meant that they
too far Carter was supporting our first

193
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,170
that's the first thing that we were able
to achieve

194
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,839
but unfold support other time

195
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,139
so this is basically the path we should
find the files

196
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,089
okay and we have the look both that's a
little of both

197
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,029
force on lock and we have the metadata
for the agent

198
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,689
so some milk is produced simple I'm ago
the

199
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,639
some guys but for the meta-data this is
actually something new

200
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,649
are again the that the design let's take
a look at the May to the top

201
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,070
not very complicated using of ocular by

202
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,600
chunks which is one per oath and

203
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,990
the 01 is basically cluster level stuff

204
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,560
so the first part the first post would
be using

205
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,869
the first real are chunk

206
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,949
okay arm

207
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,750
to that's pretty much the the Journal of
5 boxer

208
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,850
not very complicated but the interesting
stuff it's really hides

209
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,600
inside so if we will dive to

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,810
one of them led to the theater

211
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,779
divided into two parts the Perth the
first about

212
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,040
is 512 case solid 512 bytes

213
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,000
and the second part is everything else
the reason why we had to split it

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,339
is that because atomic right and we need
to make sure that

215
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:43,959
though I thought only okay can only be
achieved

216
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,290
a maximum of this size okay

217
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,779
so the first part which is the first 512
bytes

218
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,070
simply hold the leaf life

219
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,720
everything inside

220
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,199
the storage take a look and the restive

221
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,040
something which is more human-readable
it full of

222
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,860
so we should be able to the bug you or
if something happens

223
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,519
you can actually prove that data take a
look and understand

224
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,730
what's going on for example we have a
very nice time them so you can actually

225
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,870
see if the host disconnected

226
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,970
or was not connected for a long time so
that could

227
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,779
to be a reason not to use that calls ok
to my Google Wave

228
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,320
view on the whole though several other

229
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,449
things feel such as the go quite
explicit

230
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:38,469
and everything else so that

231
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,170
what we make sure the those would
include

232
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,729
we have atomic rights which means every
time

233
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,410
are the vocal we liked it everyone else

234
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,980
will be able to leave that information
the same information is being honored by

235
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,899
all the other

236
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,889
of so that in general

237
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,230
is all that we needed weather looking
system

238
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,550
we have a way to synchronize all the
hosts together

239
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,589
on show 530 manifests

240
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,269
and basically that's it the only thing
we left with now

241
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,449
is to solve the whole chicken-and-egg
stuff which means how to install love

242
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:18,870
you

243
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,949
with an operating system with the
application and then

244
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:25,589
control that we have from the opposition

245
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,300
hosting so this is the basic flow

246
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,099
K the first one is I'll a bit long the
corner

247
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,300
second one and later I happens much
faster

248
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,399
okay so we start with a basic setup

249
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,980
them without the host to them %eh

250
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,699
a and we have media them being installed
and kit the Firth

251
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,250
and only of those domain we have four
high-visibility

252
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,060
then we need to start the VM for the
first time it's an empty VM

253
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,380
and the discs I'll located inside than
you thought with the

254
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,810
created without installing the operating
system

255
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,170
and drove in and we need to reboot
everything to make sure the people

256
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,560
system

257
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,449
and we get after they both lease lock

258
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,469
for that VM on that note with us

259
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,370
to have him running be over them

260
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,220
for that would be the flow for the first
hold anything else with the

261
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,810
much of the basically well helping to
set up

262
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,910
aligning the of them HA

263
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,639
reaffirmed his install will actually be
able to detect

264
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,769
the the thought domain

265
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,949
already exist so we will ask the user
hey if this

266
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,639
are Asia annual a walking on the second
know though

267
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,810
all about you will say yes will simply
copy all the settings

268
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,029
form the previous no that's it

269
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,879
although so let's see how it looks like

270
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,490
in real life from not doing any live
demo still because as we all know the

271
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,599
network is

272
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,859
best the fourth one not taking

273
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,260
so it's not going to look very good so I

274
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,420
use my amazing graphic for

275
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,600
the very good but Journal this is how
without

276
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,389
with on the set up telling of the about
2,000 creative via

277
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,150
do everything needed have a lot of stuff
lining heel

278
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,230
and then will be enough for the thought
configuration

279
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,230
should give a thought stolen show
followed

280
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,320
bath okay the country will planning for
glass the

281
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,159
and there's more coming this is quite an
advanced stuff for my

282
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,240
both K the

283
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,980
we will continue to on network
configuration

284
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,400
VM configuration and we can decide how
many how much memory one

285
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,850
I'll what kind of the Pew how many few

286
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,100
and we end with the phone

287
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,219
with the host events and configuration
itself

288
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,140
basically we'll ask for the ID on the
first hole

289
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,420
with by the foot is one K some

290
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,120
%uh though relevant information like

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,429
passport and so on and so forth

292
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,660
then it will keep aligning and feel it
would finish everything

293
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,940
it will create a VM for the first time
and we

294
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,980
will provide us the way to connect into
the

295
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,400
p.m. and as we remember from

296
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,330
on the float out we no need to install
the ok with

297
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,370
so info the opposite the fifth though
will reboot

298
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,408
a the VM's at the multiplicative

299
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,549
again for of with the the operating
system now

300
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,240
and well being asked to install over and
side

301
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,370
this is lying rule and that's basically
the end

302
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,370
the ages so this is all being an able
and everything is it started to get the

303
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:10,370
locks again officially and we have often
successfully set up on the first No

304
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
that's what you feel when you

305
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,010
real into the Administrative Court

306
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,830
for those who go to the whole thing up
you ended with the the first Hoth

307
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,090
we managed to star

308
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,908
that first No and if we will go to the

309
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,720
vote on ocean star you will be able to
see all the details love

310
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,030
so have hosted internalize

311
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,299
K the next test will be to

312
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,370
come up with a second no all and that

313
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,250
as a third much simpler and without that
we don't believe you have over

314
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,610
really those simple I'm deploy

315
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,418
who can provide a mouthful file but if
we won't provide that

316
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:59,740
a 1 we will understand that there is all
this does that mean for

317
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,600
hopeful of the vendor then we will ask
you for

318
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,289
to be able to ssh into that machine and
we will automatically use a sick people

319
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:08,789
cope with

320
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,340
all the relevant for things form the
second no

321
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,439
mall and we will only ask you for in AD

322
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,710
for the new know the you just created

323
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,409
before destroying this case

324
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,159
and basically that the you can go into
the miss little though

325
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,620
tell you you have another one set up the
fifth with free

326
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,899
we have to hold climbing now okay this
is a full from

327
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,419
place but this is the hosted engine
itself

328
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,110
know we have to know covering for the
health concerns so if one of them

329
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,389
cautious

330
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,419
would be good would be the film both of
them

331
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,330
for remarkably even if the oath doesn't
Russian

332
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,250
we only move the network of dollars or
something like that

333
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,630
we will be able to my good with whom

334
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,760
to another host thats

335
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,270
basically I'll also at the park

336
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,309
with give the very nice

337
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,350
I'll picture

338
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,770
if we wanna try something relations

339
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,809
okay the services all something quality

340
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:27,010
for you so this is a report to get
former

341
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,770
start to squarely in the host over

342
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,340
filled the first hole difficult for them
to and you can see the

343
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,879
in this case we have the VM up we have a
good have

344
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,679
that too marks in moscow and the gate
with

345
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,900
on the second hole the VM down because
it's running hail

346
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,320
K and we also have the perfect score

347
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,220
to 1400 and the gateways down

348
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,370
in order to test it

349
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,719
block the Gateway hosted into

350
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,919
which is well the whole truth and nvm
islamic

351
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,929
this is what we going to so

352
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:12,140
the VM was running new that's the whole

353
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,490
okay take a look at it with a mission if
there's one

354
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,289
p.m. migrating sexually migrating away
from here and into

355
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:25,140
you if you think about it

356
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,659
the VM is running the engine and its
lives migrating itself

357
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:34,539
43 is while live migration is happening

358
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:39,529
is quite amazing that the VM itself you
can see the status is

359
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:43,860
migrating fall okay and it's currently
running on

360
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,899
and too but it will move to

361
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,429
of them 3 venture

362
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,580
so that's how it looks like and that's
the expected

363
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,510
without and this is what will happen

364
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,039
when wifi Billy Paul you can go in and
see that the Gateway

365
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,980
is not being the world with the food and
that's why would you

366
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,610
the school that's resulted with the live
migration

367
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,760
of the Benton himself Hill

368
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,740
everything is fine in the area

369
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,190
so basically that's it okay

370
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,429
we can return to the fundamental
question of why did the chicken cross

371
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,690
the road

372
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,779
and answers

373
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,919
could have been the Gateway almost

374
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,919
form what we tested didn't close though
it was migrated

375
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,360
that's it questions

376
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,360
yet

377
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,480
know that's exactly what I showed you
need to wonder if

378
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,320
just yet you just unit 120 students and
set up but it will automatically

379
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,110
fuck you all those things form the first
one so it will only ask you what's the

380
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,629
eighty basically and that's it

381
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,670
your also school the

382
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,950
longest election only open for the first
time because the all taken stuff but

383
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:27,950
one still through it's very fast

384
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,780
okay the question was whether it's
possible

385
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,110
to install the operating system the
whole student in with a fixable

386
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:49,110
and the answers are different this yep

387
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,000
so it can you repeat the question

388
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,269
yeah

389
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:07,269
with both the fifth yeah

390
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,049
right

391
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,199
Aug left I have class too so so let me
just repeat the question the question is

392
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:24,369
I now understand is how a how far away
is the glass to support

393
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,399
so in general what we did here

394
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:30,539
doing the implementation is that we use
stand-up

395
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,579
BDSM nobody's well walking with the DSM

396
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:37,168
to create and maintain the store as
possible to the gym

397
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,320
and sis video semi's already supporting
everything

398
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,570
general it shouldn't be that difficult

399
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,369
we are now trying to general we are now
trying to make it work

400
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:54,399
arm so

401
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,089
your with it

402
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,249
through this

403
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:05,279
it's a nicely Cup

404
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,829
that

405
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:15,829
another one almost there

406
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,850
so since we're using VSM abilities a

407
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,199
we don't have a lot to the gap is not
that big but we have to test it

408
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,540
okay so actually glass the

409
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,070
should come up in the near future with
like bill middle-class to support or

410
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,399
something like that so we consider you
know

411
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,620
you know taking advantage of that but

412
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,310
in general for Sun and block device is
one of this thing it

413
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,399
and I hope that we won't have a lot to
my life to

414
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,410
so I would expect that to come in any
order coming next versions

415
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:56,410
month so if it's well it's not three or
four probably three to five okay the

416
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,970
question is is set also on the list

417
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,980
I am so I was previously I was
discussing I was towing a boat while the

418
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,840
solutions we saw with pacemaker

419
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,010
so it's either supple pacemaker was
still considering

420
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,720
that you know in the in the next be
major version

421
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,240
we may want to a consider again

422
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,720
so or basically so we're not ruling out
that completely

423
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,730
miss 2004 of both we need some mileage

424
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,240
to work with of them to give it's like

425
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,270
because if a live on him I Sony

426
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,000
to make sure that it's completely love
and then if you can

427
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,620
improve that by integrating with
something like that all

428
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,780
arm pacemaker growth

429
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,700
be or questions

430
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,280
thank you very much
