1
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:03,510

2

be fun

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,820
and enough it should salute a V-chip

7

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,239
I'm just gonna fast the few facts

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,300
I say what's been going on was to pen
with a few things

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,709
and then I'll try to heaven long open
session so open question sessions

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,660
so if you have a lot of questions write
them down I'll try to answer them as

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,628
much as I can

20

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,070
I am so the first thing I want to say is
Tom

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,199
I don't know if you guys have been
following the Thunderbird Wentz

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,030
I into maintenance mode a year ago

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,750
in November 2012 all

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,850
was the last released on by a complete
within team

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,259
since then the people that we're working
on that team have been reassigned to

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,189
other things

29
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,979
some love them have kept as bit of time
to work on Thunderbird so

30
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,360
the latest release that came out a was
it a month

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,240
two months ago was the No mostly in only
by volunteers

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,259
and as you can see on that contribution
graft thats

33
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,640
argued the source later but that's the
contribution graph to

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,979
I'm with a Thunderbird over the years in
terms of comments

35
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,110
are 2008 is when

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,680
a modular messaging was creating version
3 in the works in since 10 with

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,239
kept it quite high in its not going that

38
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,629
that low same thing goes for the number
views as we have

39
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,549
and so that's quite good news

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,110
I am not on the list and Mike are gonna
be about development support you a

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,690
on the things that you need in an
organization or in in a project

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,609
to and deliver a great product to your
users so

43
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,810
from the first thing we got rid of these
yes our branch

44
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,550
on between version 17 inversion 24

45
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,120
we meeting two versions of Thunderbird
so double the work for witnesses

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,300
double the work for Q a double the work
for blah blah blah

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,950
on the hope the initial plan was like oh
yeah

48
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,339
there's gonna be some guys gonna come up
with a so great future that we're gonna

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,510
have to really something between 17 and
24

50
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,569
but we don't want to disturb our
enterprise user so

51
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:05,359
well keep something special for them 24
arrived and we rely so

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,420
it's been a year almost already what
came in

53
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,599
whole no BB Fisher so we don't really
need that thing so we can

54
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,440
so now everybody using Thunderbird uses
the same version

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,840
except if you're using beta & Nikes

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,159
but I'm pretty sure that's not so many
people welcome to that

57
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,849
leader so I am I'm gonna start its

58
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,869
I'm not gonna start in the order that in
there important thing there are burning

59
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,690
right now is

60
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,970
around chat because chats most of the
code is borrowed from a

61
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,140
another project that's called in
standard and

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,869
in standard is on now hosting everything
inside

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,370
budget essential the bones are in bags
out the same Bugzilla

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,780
so integration goes way faster way
easier for them

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,790
so and its the are ya

66
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,379
in Thunderbird in the last year that got
the most fixes the most

67
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,950
patches and thats the most work done

68
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,189
because they have a great community
working for that and we get that for

69
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:06,609
free

70
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,970
well almost for free there's a few
comments once in awhile so

71
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,260
thanks thanks to them the am

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,659
other thing that we're working on right
now is rewriting the to

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,009
the mine the mime decoder

74
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,770
so for those who don't know an email is
made a headers

75
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,710
and then a buddy and then in the body
you're supposed to only affect

76
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,190
but the most of the emails you receive
these days contain HTML images

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,180
attachments on

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,850
and so forth to get these you encode

79
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,470
everything that you attach in your email
or everything that's not being Texan

80
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,250
your email

81
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,840
with something called mine mine is
defined in for a sees

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,580
but it's loosely defined so it's
implemented all over the world in

83
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,258
different

84
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,560
it's been ok it's been implemented over
time and in

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,020
fares plants that are sending stuff
through email

86
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,130
and it's really not the code we have

87
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,580
is the scanner as a can of spaghetti
that nobody really understands how it

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,680
works

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,080
except one guy East are you decided like
cool I don't want the spaghetti more

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
and I want to be able to I want to be
able to get more

91
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,350
I want I want to get a better code and I
want some code that's gonna be able to

92
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,259
be used by

93
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,570
other projects so he said that staged a
C-plus best thing that does that for us

94
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,340
right now in

95
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,810
writings yes we have plenty of

96
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,020
test cases already that's true let's
make sure their past

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,799
they're passing so right now the big the
thing that's gonna happen for the next

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,990
version of Thunderbird is

99
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,440
the way we and all %ah email messages

100
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,289
but for the user it's not going to
change anything the second thing that we

101
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,250
would like to

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,930
to having versions are you on is a
better way to deal with

103
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,310
your contacts in your address book same
thing

104
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,190
the address book old his problem from
1999 the one that we're using right now

105
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,310
so not up to date and then every time we
want to add something

106
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,530
it's like okay that's true this who was
it sticky yep

107
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,250
its ticketed let's keep it that way ok
that sticking and

108
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,610
day the end up with a bowl and then
stick stick stick some bubbles around

109
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,069
ok another can of spaghetti so on

110
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,190
where me writing that with %uh with %uh
with the way to be 0

111
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,729
to be open and extensible I me that

112
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,539
on we're going to have a core and then
you'll have to liking one thing in will

113
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,930
be able to do

114
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,919
card I have another will be able to read
CSV file another will be able to import

115
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,530
they'll be fine on

116
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,818
again for you it's not going to change
anything in the product

117
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,060
and initially I think the only thing we
want to implement is the court thing

118
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,680
without any plugging inside and at the
peace things are going

119
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
not can happen much much much and the
last thing that

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,330
we're seeing a lot is back bitches and
that's really good so we are nothing new

121
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,630
features in Thunderbird

122
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,940
so you not being wilma you is completely
changed

123
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,509
all good the only thing you're saying is
like bug fixes the yearbooks which is

124
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,349
there

125
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:11,630
and once in a while yes we do change to
you I but its most

126
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,949
mostly what's good getting in right now
is but pictures so

127
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,039
and its all bugs night or buts cereal
box

128
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,930
attempted development is something
that's frightening right now

129
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,880
but again if you guys wanna spend some
time will welcome you

130
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,590
place to come is stash male they have
been on IRC montana

131
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,869
on IRC that but you know that art
somewhere else can they go

132
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,560
for being a dirty planning winningest
I'm support

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,349
so right now we're using that
satisfaction for support we have a

134
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,400
thriving community there

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,460
and on the issue is that some of the
stuff we do

136
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,549
we need to reference to normal Firefox
are

137
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,529
the code is that we share with Firefox
and

138
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,459
and it's difficult if your Firefox
support personnel

139
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,849
or someone does support for Firefox to
switch to the tools we have

140
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,119
same thing the other way round so we've
been weeks

141
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,509
we've been working on that for the last
two years getting the support that we

142
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,699
use in two then

143
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,859
normal sumo thing is that is used for
Firefox that's going to happen in the

144
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:14,289
neck

145
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,919
not happened yet but it's happening in
the next six months

146
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,149
so we'll have a unify to offer support
for them to run in

147
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:26,109
Firefox who waiting for that for a very
very long time

148
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:30,399
who know my part quality I am that's a

149
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,318
not much is going there because I really
don't have time and the two or three

150
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,620
contributors that are

151
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,698
that I've been active there they're
still doing their job guys just that

152
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:43,929
we lost one person for time which was me
so

153
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,040
the the and the other thing that

154
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,870
we're missing compared to Firefox for
instance Firefox eyes

155
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,230
up to five percent of their users are
using that to

156
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,970
we r 0 that 43 percent to our users
using better

157
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,410
and that really makes a big difference

158
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,439
media me makes a big difference because

159
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,829
on it's very rare these days for Firefox
to

160
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,729
discover issues when the release for
Thunderbird every time we released their

161
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,069
sack

162
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,269
all your this antivirus thingy that of
our users use

163
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,459
is broken with the new version and we
only see it on the day we release

164
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,349
so I've been running

165
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,149
I'm not asking you to run likely for
that I'm just asking more people on data

166
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,559
asking to be you download it

167
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,370
I'm I

168
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,069
yes if you are you going to there's a
pic here for that became an unlikely

169
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:45,360
saw and I've been running 94

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,649
we left in the stimulus and as the for
six years

171
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,230
and I never lost an email soul hmm

172
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,819
the well I've lost emails are not the
NSA

173
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,498
about eschelon about a few things better

174
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,829
it's been pretty stable in terms of what
i've seen

175
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:08,309
but your mileage may vary that was for
quality so yah

176
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,939
quality I would my objective for this
year's to double

177
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:16,160
the number of users we have a better
still don't know how I'm going to tackle

178
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,269
at but having more people

179
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:21,959
on especially in Windows because on

180
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,799
ninety percent of our users on Windows
in the I don't know why

181
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,559
another systems people just remembered
but on Windows there and Thunderbird and

182
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:29,990
then they

183
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,189
install this a petition that had another
spam filter

184
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:36,250
and then an antivirus thing in the in
the heat

185
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,149
in in a burden that that breaks things
unfortunate for us

186
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,389
the people that are providing this
already up

187
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,790
for people that are providing the stalls
they don't provide they don't do

188
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,410
chu a with their products are just
expecting our product to continue

189
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,399
working the way it used to

190
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,649
um so marketing I it took us

191
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,279
three months to get the keys to at most
thunderbird in the Facebook page we have

192
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,110
so we now have two people that are
supposed to be actively doing marketing

193
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,540
for

194
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,480
thunderbird which means from working out
on us promoting your images and data

195
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,490
and it's starting stony to come here so
if you wanna

196
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,620
follow what's going on this is the on
Twitter account you should follow

197
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,529
that's the sources of the grass social

198
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,110
I should be four I'll we have to be
likely be weekly meeting

199
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,360
on Tuesdays at 9 CG

200
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,250
where we talk about stuff in work we're
going where we're going

201
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,980
how we're going to do it and we discuss
everything opinion that

202
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,529
minutes so if you wanna follow
subtracted out

203
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,339
send message questions can I answer and
come to the meeting injustice in its

204
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:43,829
kind of

205
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,549
interesting questions by

206
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:53,160
I need to wait for them Mike been

207
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,579
be hello

208
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,059
I just a quick suggestion about your
better testing program

209
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,689
perhaps you can get more people involved
there was a way through the interface to

210
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:05,250
check

211
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,179
starts on the beta versions some weight
it is easier than asking people to

212
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,600
download install a different

213
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,630
kinda parallel program especially for
Windows users

214
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,240
that might suggestion and a question is
for the last couple years I've kinda

215
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,720
felt that Thunderbird is sorghum

216
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,299
limping towards the grave and I'm
wondering he is seeing a presentation

217
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:28,380
today it

218
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,339
kinda reinforces that notion I'm
wondering why

219
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,230
you feel that Thunderbird is getting a
lot less attention a lot less resources

220
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,990
a lot less

221
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,449
everything then other projects mazzola

222
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:46,120
aren't just talking to them bit of a dip

223
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,880
um so I'm there something that has been
lacking for a very long time for the

224
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,509
project is a vision to where the project
needs to go

225
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,630
right now this we still have that we
don't we all have a Roma

226
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,509
we don't have because we're able to make
a road map

227
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,120
so once you don't have once you don't
know where you're going it's difficult

228
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,630
to concentrate on going there

229
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,949
technical stuff that we're doing right
now are good but

230
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,319
they are not they're not giving you a
clear direction of

231
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:19,160
on I've why and

232
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,899
where your way you wanna go and the
other thing is

233
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,899
on it's about usage

234
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,149
and who uses the program and if you look
at that

235
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:35,110
it's mostly people in Europe while most
of the project is governed

236
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,120
outside of Europe and

237
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,589
on and has a very different visions

238
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,589
a very very on different vision where
emails gonna go

239
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:51,130
some people I've spoken some people
think email is dead

240
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm that email is only when male that

241
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,649
mission but they're just having email on
your laptop

242
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,490
when has that kind of discussion after
that really really difficult X

243
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,860
to set a vision for the product that
does exactly the country if

244
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,850
summer visit division that's that
surround and where people should be

245
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,850
pushing was i clear

246
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,419
you're not the only one who doesn't like
it

247
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,519
other questions I hello

248
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,069
am can you give any advice and what you
would

249
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:31,969
held and and NGO organization that

250
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,259
and whose headed by T has said okay
we're going to use Outlook

251
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,259
and Internet Explorer

252
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,160
any advice on the arguments you would
use I know

253
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,569
I have some but I'd begotten p.m. the
first 1i would go for ISC

254
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:53,079
total cost of ownership you need to pay
licenses for all our

255
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,579
I don't mean licenses for the products
we have thats once

256
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,099
I A you answer that one yeah it's a
question

257
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,220
ok I so that's that's the first one

258
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,809
the second one is on

259
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,860
the day on

260
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,199
Mozilla says we are not gonna find
anything anymore for Thunderbird

261
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,539
well you can say right I don't give a
shit the source code they can come to

262
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,759
light myself and use it myself

263
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,529
that's the second one on

264
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,730
and then depends what the NGO does right
so we can know did the code and say we

265
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,910
don't have bagged or sending every males
to the NSA for instance

266
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,879
said maybe she'd give you the more it
said human rights

267
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,759
defending organization and the argument
was

268
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,610
a.m. you know we have no idea what's
happening with Thunderbird %uh

269
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,759
last dot cut to the question that the
person said

270
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,250
but thank you yep nerve now

271
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:59,250
so well the guy with the long hair first
because I don't know him

272
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,049
in what about unique mail and

273
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,819
may use encryption overall one dirty you
good reason

274
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,909
to use it while you can use pgp right
with the world

275
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,669
with windows and you get the same thing
yeah I am

276
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,679
just some speaking about

277
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,110
outlook this pgp file

278
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,749
their 0 okay so BGP is a commercial
product for Windows

279
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:35,429
so and before before I came to this
presentation I was another presentation

280
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,730
in another room

281
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,040
I where the guy from mail pile who hails

282
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,709
released now for today I'm and he seemed

283
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,819
very excited about the future email and
he talked about

284
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,998
and making one of his key things was
making

285
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,179
email and in cryptid and by default

286
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,799
and doing SNTP overt or so that you
could

287
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,540
you know your mail pile could receive
email Torin therefore

288
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,049
you know you no one could see you from
the meta-data who things were going and

289
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:05,898
also to

290
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:09,500
interesting ideas for the future email
I'm and

291
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,898
I didn't think I did the man is dead and
I think that's

292
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:17,438
okay that was in my opinion right sorry
you got that it was in my opinion

293
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,649
that I when I see I know Anna but what I
guess what I'm

294
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:24,309
what i'm saying is that there is
excitement in the email space

295
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm and if Thunderbird is to use

296
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,299
drive it needs to capture some other if
it doesn't catch someone that will

297
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,139
happen it was all continue being the
same for the next

298
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:37,219
however long it is an actually to be
honest that might well be suitable for

299
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,179
the NJ

300
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,220
you know if you want a product that
isn't gonna change on you for five years

301
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,649
Thunderbird may well

302
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:46,489
be it here under the current development
right love enterprises one that kinda

303
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,040
thing

304
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,740
at you know you could argue email is
stable the practicals then change it

305
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,940
just keeps working

306
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,950
right but if if Thunderbird one stage do
new things

307
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,049
then there's excitement out there in the
things that people are excited to do

308
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,379
but we have to demonstrate to people
that we had the place where they can

309
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,299
happen

310
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:06,750
danger

311
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,100
what you doing Tuesday i buy

312
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,619
out abst

313
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,689
Anna for the NGO that could be
interesting to you that

314
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,600
some I'll look as has numerous
governmental look and if you use Outlook

315
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,100
a few months later you have exchange and
does not only the license for of look

316
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,719
but for other things to zo

317
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,790
if the when a look in doesn't a the NGO
doesn't want to look

318
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,340
in and has a specific have company

319
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,209
then this should use Thunderbird

320
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,659
there's one more question in the prop
are there too

321
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,859
but in the front row that might

322
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:52,500
coming a good thing to do seen as I work
in a company where

323
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,080
deal Microsoft and I'm still want a guy
we want to use them by nixon

324
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,949
I don't care of Windows and so they are
using Exchange

325
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,169
and when I at to come to make
Thunderbird walkways

326
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,179
changed was like opinion yes really so

327
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,580
because of them I can and I had to find
yet owns an

328
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,220
to make contact when I wanted to hear
SSL work

329
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,250
new never work so it's plain text
because I need my contacts of course

330
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,419
and all these things in my calendar
syncing correctly so

331
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,429
even Manzo years you said

332
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,629
gmail is a dead them why don't you make
an effort right to you

333
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,639
work better with my cousin you know its

334
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:38,830
give me the IP specification and maybe
and the required time to implement it

335
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,490
and then we'll do it

336
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,929
up I it's been available for two years

337
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,889
and we can happen i'm for the last two
years

338
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:57,320
made a proper license

339
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,428
my

340
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,159
idea so how much

341
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,770
if the work going into kinda the
lighting so that things are more mature

342
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,100
than the court is going to take things
like lightning

343
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,309
and record Adams people using gonna make
a big difference to them

344
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:24,309
or not

345
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,899
up so that contribution graphically had
that was for Concentra laws at

346
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,160
accommodation tal again how much all
sunday bird

347
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,590
depends on the common code thats
missiles Hong

348
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,000
so we rely on the decal nickel and SPR

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,690
and assess on the alarm and the

350
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,410
your jewel and the jewel interpreter so

351
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:55,290
everything besides the UI mostly
everything besides the UI because

352
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,110
yet

353
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,309
we rely on the Russians said the UI than
bill Firefox

354
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,090
there's one more question in the second
row power in

355
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,709
gone

356
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,040
you said that to to number two i at the
moment doesn't have

357
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,220
a roadmap what's actually blocking you
from

358
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,010
creating one politics

359
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,250
here it's not in my to the people
actually we do have a

360
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,330
Roma the room that right now is to have
just my man and sample

361
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,350
ready for 31 which for people that are
using the product is gonna

362
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,939
making a change because for them the way
we parse message internally

363
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,910
doesn't change the way they're reading
their emails the way that we're

364
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,669
probably gonna start integrating with
other context of until approx until we

365
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:49,540
provide

366
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,389
contract on contact connectors

367
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,790
is not going to affect the way they use
the product on a daily basis

368
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,840
so we do have a grown up in its like

369
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,370
on the room but we have is more like
towards

370
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,219
picking stuff that we should affix long
ago but at the same time

371
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,240
like he was saying about mail pile
Anders there is movement on

372
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,820
you why on on you I level 2 know people
are kinda got used to the Gmail

373
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,780
interface got used to a whole bunch of
things

374
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,540
showed us love thing that could happen
we are open

375
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,129
we're not close as us we need someone
wants to do that

376
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,360
and we currently don't have that so it
says people die with up to know the

377
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,139
people we have that are excited right
now

378
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,260
inside a team are people that want to

379
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,320
on work on the low level stuff the only
part that

380
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,918
has people excited about the Y right now
is the check people

381
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,250
they're all excited about you I very
very excited about you I

382
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,500
and they're making changes and they're
listening to their users

383
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,840
on the other thing that to and

384
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,899
the reason we have that mindset also
about not change in you eyes because

385
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,650
the few times we tried we tried a few
times version 3 worship 3.1 version for

386
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,650
with try changing every time a change is
something

387
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,820
you get back who mom

388
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,149
and a so it's very very difficult

389
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,900
to make changes that the O when you too
possible I'll

390
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,940
up thank you write their name
