1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,189
so hi everybody it's awful the day

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,810
hope better now so

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,178
a.m. my thoughts on that

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,710
that I will just start okay

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,000
so oil I my name is Omar Franco and I'm
a software engineer and

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,750
team lead in read a threat and I'm also

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,160
a over engine maintain a and

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,560
of attention project when I'm gonna talk
about today

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,059
is a

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,680
how we made over to become a
multi-platform management capable

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,120
starting with x86 and ppc64

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,829
and basically how we got tilt it to be

13
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,739
and multi-platform and I will go through

14
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:52,078
little background or their a

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,690
what we did to make this happen and a
little bit about the people that did

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,550
this war

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,979
and a little bit about overt for anyone
who

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,080
less familiar with it am discuss the
problems

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,520
that we had to face the solution that
was a

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,960
accepted what we did I will show a
little cold and configuration

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
and then discuss a little and what is
this the lifted

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,678
so some moolah

23
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:26,990
our goal was bringing a multiplatform
management capabilities to over

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,720
and starting with x86 and ppc64 and
basically

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,880
a have been over to be a multiplatform

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,810
capable why why now so

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,340
gave am on power air system was a known
standard

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,539
recently and also and there was another
announcement of the open poll consortium

29
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:53,729
a by Google IBM and GD in some

30
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,630
a deal

31
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,560
be companies so this becomes a

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,939
relevant now and also it was a good
opportunity to have the infrastructure

33
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,770
to have

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,329
and more platforms support you know
field

35
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,739
just in case more platforms with the
port KVM

36
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,790
in the future so something very poor
important

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,519
and everything I'm gonna talk about
today it was contributed

38
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,599
a by developers for me and a lot of
Brazil

39
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,660
at the rubble is a not-for-profit
organization they are located in Brazil

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,319
in

41
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,458
focused on the technology do that
development and basically

42
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,819
is all community members that
contributed

43
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,310
this support and it was a really nice
work with them and I want to

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,590
talk about this just a little because it
was very interesting process with these

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,030
guys

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,700
so these guys 12 disintegration de Sant

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,440
designed to deal that we key a Wii

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,769
maintainers and other community did some
review to this design some enhancements

49
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,609
and once this design was accepted the
development

50
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,109
and the implementation phase started and
again we

51
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:11,549
over I'll see 2 more make it the shorts
I could because these guys in Brazil so

52
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,370
in was a big time difference and also
over males

53
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,660
we solve the all the issues and our main
panels will

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,799
really closely with this guy's helping
them

55
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,100
and figure out all the issues that they
had

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,388
and making sure the code has been
reviewed in a

57
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,329
and timely manner and because we really
wanted

58
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,850
and we actually succeeded to make its
part of the day

59
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,358
calling to 34 Lisa love you so this is a

60
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,959
really great success for us okay so

61
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,790
a little bit both overt the anyone here
already knows over

62
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,138
okay the so

63
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,670
I'll go through it quickly it just to
make sure

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,298
pay everyone will know after that okay
so by definition over it is

65
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,379
low-skill centralized management for
server and desktop virtualization

66
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,768
what it means it that we have open
source alternative

67
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,000
for applications is like this fear and
be center

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,230
and it allows manage in VA

69
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,070
virtual datacenters and the focus is on
KVM

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,260
if all this integration and performance
a lil using KVM

71
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,289
and there is a big focus on is a fair
use in is a deployment

72
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,740
for the user so over it is really easy
to deploy and use

73
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,250
has their administrator was too create
your

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,530
and

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,140
virtualized data centers and for users
as well

76
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,280
so looks okay

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,890
so them you can use overt for small

78
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,560
environments lie like the single data
center single host

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,750
running couple the VM's this is
basically good for Des Moines testing

80
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,490
because

81
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,660
here you don't have is some really
important

82
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,860
victimization features that I K

83
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,250
like migration now you can grow we've
over two more the pill

84
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,650
wanted a defender and more the cluster
environment

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,840
basically you can see here I hope you
can see here

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,989
and over it manages multiple data center

87
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,690
each data center has multiple cluster
and each cluster has multiple hosts

88
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,010
so cluster is some kind of migration to
me and within cluster

89
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,580
you can like my good vans from one host
to another

90
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,250
um

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,610
I want to give you are really quick
high-level architecture for over just

92
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,210
because I'm gonna talk about this
complements later so

93
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,430
I'm not gonna go too deep to over

94
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,430
so we have the engine this is a Java
application runs on JBoss

95
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,820
this is basically where all the logic
and

96
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,930
relays and all the decisions are taken

97
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,449
in our engine if it's a scheduling
decisions and other decisions

98
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,919
in this is also a

99
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,299
the gate we all use a request are sent
to the engine and engine process it then

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,210
and do something with and the engine
talks with the hosts

101
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,169
and

102
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,700
the the that actually runs and the PM's

103
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,710
in the host with agent we call it the
DSM

104
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,440
the agent has a

105
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,580
me couple of important

106
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,710
anal responsibilities so first he does
all the host live in consideration if

107
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,289
its torrid zone at work

108
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,080
and of course a and there's a within
that related to the VM's on this

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,180
specific cost

110
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,900
will use in Louisville full VM
operations if it's a stop in stock in

111
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,849
migrating and we also have another a pic
it's called mom

112
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,970
that is responsible for scheduling and
SLAs

113
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,890
services and finally of course on the
host with

114
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,400
runnin guests all VM's which options

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,090
and the guess they then agent within a

116
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,789
used a package that responsible for

117
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,310
is sending information from within the
guess outside

118
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,310
and effete say IPA or applications that
are installed the information that

119
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,800
we want to show up in the air in the
engine a way about me

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,470
and also responsible for some commands

121
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,140
on the and guest inside if it's for
example singing

122
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,020
single sign-on that we really have to
communicate with the lowest

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,570
inside the guest okay

124
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,370
so what was the idea so if you remember
before I showed you there are multiple

125
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,210
data centers and

126
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,570
each data center has cluster what you
wanted to achieve is that

127
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,849
we could have and cluster which is

128
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,630
x86 is today and also have class sells
for my daughter

129
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,000
and platforms like class today

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,490
a ppc64 cluster and in the future if
available

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,980
anything that's boats KVM SEL armies

132
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,460
the question mark and the goal of course
was at in this

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,650
support we've mini mall as far as
possible minimal changes

134
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,120
it today architecture inside the engine
and to the UI

135
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,300
to use the existing infrastructures and
saw

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,700
so what is the problems there

137
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,370
that we had to deal with first

138
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,590
overt was designed and developed with a
single

139
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,640
to find mine am we only had

140
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,280
x86 supported for Peavey amp so this is
what the we develop foreign

141
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,400
this is the only thing that we had in
mind and

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,439
what the what happens is that

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,780
and there is no place for specific
asians a for example the end devices

144
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,949
and like networking display in the sky
just the same as in the physical world

145
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,950
not on the configuration of supported on
all platforms

146
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,680
so for example and in over to you can
have disk interface

147
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,930
aite here tell you over to use cuz it
and

148
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,380
and we found it ppc64 doesn't support
lady

149
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,990
so we had to do and some filtering

150
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,500
and to block users from trying to use it
on PPC because we know it will set

151
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,860
am

152
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,870
more problems that we've had so many
assumptions were made

153
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,970
and without taking a platform in month
so for example

154
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,020
PCI addressing is different between x86
and ppc64

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,470
so we had to deal with the any in run
time we had to change the code that does

156
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,320
that dressing

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,040
and they would show that later all souls
some features

158
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,750
I am not supported in all platforms if
for example live migration is

159
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,950
still not supported in ppc64 so again
its official yet to

160
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,560
block according to the architecture so
the solution that was suggested and

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,300
eventually

162
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,390
and we used was using this strategy

163
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,449
and design pattern am I have some

164
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,440
and

165
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,400
they remove it basically and the
strategy design pattern what he say that

166
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,079
you have the interface of a what is
supported what are the actions that are

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,940
supported

168
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,880
and you can have different
implementation so implementation 1&2

169
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,550
will be

170
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,760
implementation for x86 and
implementation for ppc64

171
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,189
what is allows us

172
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,390
is and couple over a important

173
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,860
things is first selecting the behavior
at runtime

174
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,390
and we don't need all kind of special
use

175
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,939
and the cases in the code and to select
which go to run

176
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,080
and it got bills the

177
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,370
and specific code altogether it come

178
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,000
Inc up so they x86 cold and in the x86
this but the G

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,380
and the APPC code in the PPC strategy
and it allows

180
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,089
a

181
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,300
people that are entering the code to

182
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,859
find the specific order varies because
it all

183
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,370
updated together and very important is
that it allows us

184
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,880
is late to it Anne mo lucky pictures

185
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,430
in the future and other stuff that we
had to take in mind is

186
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,109
we r a defining a architecture in the
cluster novell

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,170
and so we could have

188
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,910
and in one day the center different and
clusters

189
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,189
and

190
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,080
platform so you could have as they
showed before

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,380
cluster for PPC in class so for x86 and
the CPU type is reported by the host it

192
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,200
allows us

193
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,500
variously to decide if a host can run in

194
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,880
in a in the cluster or not and

195
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
also in over two years the to

196
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,349
configuration packages that Daria game

197
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,340
we are using it as infrastructure for
decide in if

198
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,220
some features supported so one and one
thing we have to do is

199
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,480
at the architecture and awareness the
configuration

200
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,830
so one is the global configuration
forfeitures and

201
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,720
another and a pic is that we have we
call it always seen for

202
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,040
it allows us to and

203
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,329
manage inning capabilities

204
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,810
in the guestlist leather so and for
example Windows

205
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,140
has set oven devices that the to

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,550
can use and Linux has a different set so
we'll use it

207
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,729
we r saving it all in a one
configuration

208
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,190
and what we have to do is to add
architecture to this

209
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,770
configuration as well and he will show
an example and

210
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,329
later Okies so

211
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,390
what was done so far we can divided to
three main phases

212
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,650
first was to identify and moves the
specific old

213
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,090
a to the strategy classes

214
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:09,990
and

215
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,570
is then a change in all day
configuration and

216
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,310
creating the new configuration for
dinner and you okay pictures that we

217
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,060
just added

218
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,779
and if I need the some specific audience
for the

219
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,260
ppc64 so

220
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,140
am we had to as they said

221
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,279
at the architecture feel it today a

222
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:38,140
cluster and also supported CPU as we
have the support its a few least

223
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,860
you know verdict we r and supporting and
once we implemented the strategy

224
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,070
design pattern so we could move on the
specific old

225
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,620
a to the right place and basically

226
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,870
create some consolation for the x86 is

227
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,580
specific or configuration

228
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,890
so I will show you think it's the next
layer would show you

229
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,560
how those in for configuration looks
like and

230
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,660
a it gives us name great if flexibility
because

231
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,230
and because this contribute to the code
didn't have to invent

232
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,709
pretty much anything they were using an
existent

233
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,099
infrastructural sown the wind basically
just add then you're

234
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,640
architecture and the new values for the
guest OS is

235
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,819
and configuration and it was just
walking out of the box

236
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,089
always gives us and flexibility in the
yuan I for sure during the we show that

237
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,850
as well so the source info how does it
look like

238
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,110
so a

239
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,829
this is a snippet of a one less and you
can see that

240
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,930
we headed that ppc64 a

241
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,060
OS and we ended the CPU architecture

242
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,998
and

243
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:59,529
class within and the value for this OS's
ppc64

244
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:03,170
so basically the lease I low key so all
we have to do is

245
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,819
and Ed x86 today

246
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,010
to debase OS and

247
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,470
of the existing OS and just this one

248
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,089
and all in

249
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,569
knew all this is that we are going to it
if you throw six and so on

250
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,569
and will inherit from this OS so

251
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:27,279
basically it will be a really easy to it
more supported OS is once we verify the

252
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,980
local

253
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,179
am

254
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:35,350
also you can see the to here we define
the devices

255
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,029
a perilous so for the specific

256
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,179
all this and since its ppc64

257
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,339
and the display protocols that are
supported

258
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,249
are only a VNC because

259
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:55,279
spice is not supported on ppc64 and this
is how we use it

260
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,910
a in the cold so although San for just
you

261
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,110
and ask for the package give me what
display types are supported for any

262
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,879
for diesel s in this compelling this
compatibility version for the cluster

263
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,569
and it will understand from the OS what
these

264
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:14,709
and

265
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:19,569
there architecture and the tones there
and at least they will show in the UI

266
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,800
whole it looks like as well

267
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
so specific

268
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,829
echo that had to be done so fifties and
the specific addressing that they took

269
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:29,589
before

270
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,800
because the dressing in a

271
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,920
the PCI addressing in a ppc64 is
different than the x86

272
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,410
and I will show that also where did the
specific a ppc64

273
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,600
devices for be done and discussing this

274
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,190
upper or how you pronounce it a

275
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,630
at the front and adjustments the

276
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,370
and I will show you right after a to
filter out only the relevant

277
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,960
choices for PPC and we heard

278
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,730
as I said before to block on support to
teachers if it's an ass that shifting

279
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,160
and migration invidious end of stage in
that they mentioned before

280
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,870
and there was some changes in the
topology and where did the process on

281
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,589
aim for the reported information

282
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:21,119
and also how to information that had to
be changed according to the

283
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,609
new peeps so

284
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,760
how does it look like in the cold and

285
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,270
you can see that and when we

286
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,200
this is the code before when we were
building VM drives so

287
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,340
there is no ask about the platform here

288
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,178
this is just and if it's very does cause
the this is what you gonna do there is

289
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:45,740
no

290
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,000
and addressing code here because on x86

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,530
and we were relying on a automatic
understand from

292
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,010
we were relying on automatic a person
from the pier

293
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,929
and ppc64 we ought to be aware of the
dressing so

294
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,150
is it clear I hope it's not too small

295
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,790
am a

296
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,899
you could see and a right under the case
the wreath

297
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,940
if and

298
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,160
if thats Aoki

299
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,460
there is no address so let's create it
and basically can see here

300
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,470
we are getting the strategy by the VM

301
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,960
and yeah we're getting the strategy by
the VM architecture

302
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,280
so this way and the code is not aware of

303
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,850
what what architectural its on in like
not because

304
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,370
will get in the lights the 2g and then
run in the cold

305
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,139
so basically one in there are signs cuz
the other school

306
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,160
so basically the the code doesn't

307
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,400
is not a will and of the specific

308
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,230
architecture because %uh strategy they
will also headed his door design pattern

309
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,930
and which has this specific im

310
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:07,070
implementation in the subproject and it
comes in handy

311
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,710
Anne the strategy gives you the correct

312
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,960
and code for day

313
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,620
architecture and a visit or and is
responsible for actually

314
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,560
executing the code that for the specific
amount if it's

315
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,460
for other ASEAN and so on which show an
example

316
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,560
so you can see here that we have their
signs cuz the address

317
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,399
and it's a architectural command and we
have implementation for 14 x86 and

318
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,260
implementation falafel PPC

319
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,379
and you can see that for x86 it still
empty because we'll still relying on the

320
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,850
old

321
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,649
a live built logic and for PPC

322
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,140
and we have different address in the
fifth civile those cuz ill

323
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,180
or if it's this poker discuss so

324
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,320
the comp although the %uh person on the
comp all those different

325
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,210
so what

326
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,370
air we have ready and you can create
cluster and mentioned the architecture

327
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,469
VM's templates and pulls everything that
overt as

328
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,560
an important in exporting and

329
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,720
keeps the architecture

330
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,410
information and a touching discs

331
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,430
according to this specific strategy
architecture sorry

332
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,750
and search in and we can search

333
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,350
VM's by the specific architecture and

334
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,230
managing the answer is starting stopping
of course so

335
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,880
a little bit how it looks like I hope
you can see

336
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
okay so this is the new cluster dialogue

337
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,190
and you can see that and below we headed
there

338
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,510
the new or supported and CPU's

339
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,740
so it's all a family of IBM Power

340
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,380
and basically once the user select and
the specific

341
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,520
and CPU than they are there

342
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,600
architecturally is and

343
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,689
set from the CPU so every

344
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,299
every step you as architecture so let's
potomac this is then new virtual machine

345
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:17,408
dialogue so you could see that above the
cluster is the PPC cluster

346
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,929
and is so the operation system is
filtered out

347
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,120
and I can see only the

348
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,090
support its ok aren't you on have other
OS but

349
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,620
and once we have verified more a VM all
this is

350
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,139
and this list will social glow

351
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,470
um this

352
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,220
still then you virtual machine dialogue
you can see it as I mentioned before

353
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,510
spice is not supported on PPC so again

354
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,790
a this is Phil allowed in the URL and

355
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,879
this is really nice because it's pretty
much magic it's all

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,290
the in for stores infrastructure dosing
for those this for us so it was really

357
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,990
a easy and I stood up and added new disc

358
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,010
and 4 p.m. their local so again you can
see that

359
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,330
at the disc interfaces all of it at all
local

360
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,379
according to the architecture so we know
that we are adding that this

361
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,800
to VM which is it PPC VM

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,389
so we will fit that I'll tidying because
it doesn't

363
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,010
for what still needs to be done

364
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,260
so there are still some issues booting
from network on PPC VM send this

365
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,660
the guys from under our door checking
this out

366
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,410
and bought them more important we have
blocked

367
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,430
features on the PPC because they are
still not implement it all

368
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,040
not exactly walk-in so live migration is
there

369
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,420
and most important one also

370
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,370
taking snapshots the in snapshots still
not supported

371
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,199
and hot plug for discs is not support
that we do have a look blog for

372
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,520
Knicks for the network interfaces but
the discs

373
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,600
state law ok

374
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,129
so summing it up am today

375
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,180
thanks to this work and overt engine is
a multi-platform ready

376
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,320
and today we have x86 and ppc64 latihan

377
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,070
in this league for release and but it's
very important to say that we had

378
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,200
now have the infrastructure to is the
end

379
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,230
a mall architecture really is me so once
we have

380
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,730
KVM supported on market that right it
will be

381
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,920
should be is the work to edit

382
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,130
andrew is a lot more information so to
resolve website

383
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,230
and the week it that the guys from
entering the crew in the latter created

384
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,440
and for the engine up for the BDSM

385
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,450
today and big projects and all the
information and implementation is there

386
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:01,450
that yep

387
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,919
yeah so

388
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,710
basically we have difference between
this CPU because

389
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,860
the a virtualization features a
different

390
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,070
KVM is different on this and on this
versions because you have different

391
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,200
features that you could use their I
don't know the IBM teachers by heart but

392
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,830
let's say that one CPU as some features

393
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,850
and that KVM can use and the other
doesn't so

394
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,719
I have to specifically say a what is the
SIP you thought for this cluster because

395
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,220
they want migration to war

396
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,309
so

397
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,928
basically you don't have to feed the
soil if you leave it blank

398
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,950
and the first host the you will head to
the cluster will set

399
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,899
this for you yeah we have automatic
setting

400
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:08,899
if you set it if you leave it empty yep

401
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,280
yep

402
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,730
I i think that

403
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,610
there is some issue there with the
storage I I don't know exactly what was

404
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,370
the problem

405
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,370
snapshot but

406
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,669
on PPC

407
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,120
so maybe I'm not updated I hope it's

408
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,120
its organizers say

409
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,980
yet

410
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,860
to do did you integrate that

411
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,290
all in over 20 to do integrated in the
PRU as well

412
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,350
so they also this deals the mission were
rendered

413
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,919
so the work on KVM air was announced

414
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,620
and regardless and I think they did some
work in the future

415
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,229
but mostly it was BDSM and the engine so

416
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,590
I think that delivered the supported and
but they're all the issues in

417
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,189
invidious them by so it works better on
all worked and lived with it sells

418
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,770
sorry it works better than Overton live
with

419
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,120
when I just use plain labored with the

420
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,520
chill for that with the whistles all
that that's good news

421
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,760
many I asked you if that's the case I
don't know

422
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,360
are it should yeah it should work we're
using the Brit

423
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,219
the same as his invasion so BDSM is in
the bird as well

424
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,470
okay so it's in the hood yeah

425
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,520
okay and then another question

426
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,060
a.m. you said arm yep you know I'm quite
horny on the

427
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:58,210
I'll till on the kind wait till March
because on this at about a new arm

428
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,860
up two runs the do you know of any work
in the

429
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,820
I have no idea I have no idea I'm sorry
%uh you know if they if they were going

430
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,240
caving I don't think we're always or
concave uniform

431
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,920
I don't think so but I didn't

432
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,660
look launch okay yes

433
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:23,660
sorry again

434
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,240
up

435
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,490
okay

436
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,110
so the question was actually at this
bind

437
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,350
what your displaying on what I
understood from your displays that you

438
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,010
already have

439
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,140
Linux running on the machine and then
you can build other Linux is on top of

440
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,640
that

441
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,700
yeah that would mean that the help I had
to already be defined

442
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,910
is any plans redefines the el bar

443
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,280
the logical partition on the machine
itself

444
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,520
okay so is there any plan to interact
with the agency so you can do

445
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,110
um configuration on the El bar or do
dynamic Dell POS on it

446
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,409
I actually I don't know I don't really

447
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,450
at the office nobody some Thorpe

448
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,860
on IBM Power so yeah I think it's
because

449
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,000
a we are using KVM and a VM is

450
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,120
the

451
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,979
is userspace soul I don't I don't think
it's

452
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,030
did has any interrupting the okay we are
out of time

453
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,040
thank you very much
