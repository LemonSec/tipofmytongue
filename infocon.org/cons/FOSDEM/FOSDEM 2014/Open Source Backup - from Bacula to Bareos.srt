1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,630
you have guns are from Killian Germany
is called the phillips tauzin even speak

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,100
about up and saucer backup wizard

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:13,549
by her son another attempt to %uh back
to that's a possibility thank you

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,140
well thank you very much

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,939
some yes I am one of the founders of the
various projects

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,448
and my talk I what like to tell you I'm

7
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,400
why we did some first what what the spa
Riaz I am

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,930
why we did too far term of affection are
because parking is a lot of work and

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,019
usually if you have an open source
project that

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,250
develops normally you can you can just
the to work with for the

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,410
the Nama project leader to get to the to
get to the project for walkin set a fork

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:46,879
in it

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,879
I'm then I wouldn't like to show some
feature highlights

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,300
home what we are them make better than
the original project

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,550
from and then I what

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,300
like 2am stress that we a really do have
fun

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,158
a mixed drink and all the sauce
philosophy and all project

18
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,310
and finally of course we are here to
find all told people that want to

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,850
participate in the project

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,880
maybe by a bringing an idea so

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,119
documentation and term code of course

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,610
whatever is a needed and Anna open
source project

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,350
so first what this party of spa Riaz is
so

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,699
network based its multi-platform backup
solution at for

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,780
a fork of a picture of the Colossus

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,829
I think well known in the open source
market dentists

27
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,929
I think the because they're all the
sauce pick up

28
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,820
bro doctor well-known um

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,898
what its for buy some from the under the
AG PL which

30
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,909
this of course the same what the

31
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,000
open source back to court already is um

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,590
what we did with this weed its lot of
code cleanup firm of the original

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,409
picture code because there are a lot of
things that we

34
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,469
think are not needed anymore and

35
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:07,140
all completes the source code is also
dead get high get help so low that

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,929
everybody can download it and

37
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,370
from yeah that's the that's it

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,640
bumble why did we the park offer of a
picture I'm

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,980
I am I have some numbers also lower arm

40
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,769
I think everybody knows oh no they
analyze the source code of open source

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,599
projects

42
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,440
and if you have a look at the pic killer
page then you see them

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,590
first on very low activity which is so

44
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,790
can I think I am absolutely true because
I think you're the last commit was done

45
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,709
more than a year ago and if you see that
the

46
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,080
in the last 12 months compared to the
year before a

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,150
you have a 28 percent less commits and
57 percent left

48
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,430
contributors so I love that looks more
like a a project but

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,319
more or less is that and you also can
see your the

50
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
the plot of the comments per month and
you feel that 2000 Fortuner

51
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,540
it expects that there will be nothing
I'm solo home

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,890
that's the reason the front of the
reason so that the Fox pictured arm

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,738
a second reason is that they're so
commercial part of picture law

54
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,230
the end to this one is not open source
anymore so um

55
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,730
something that we need think it's not
acceptable because I usually if you have

56
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,768
an office of project

57
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,319
to bring your contribution to it because
you know it's all stays open

58
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,700
and if somebody then takes it makes
another product of it are you

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,140
just have no pic or product that's no
open source anymore

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,649
on um

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,680
get what's what's the goal so of all our
for

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,670
yeah from we want to have it to 100
percent free software so we

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,390
I absolutely have promised that we will
not do something like they do so

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,040
dollar Caldwell always be completely
open um

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,250
we want to have a continuous development
so that the

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,750
from the project is it's not that hot

67
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,230
a life and working and we adapt to the
needs that are

68
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,179
out there are customers and as yours Twi

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,769
home try to be comfortable to make you
less harsh possibilities from the

70
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,620
beginning because

71
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
for their Sol radio relatively big

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,970
a information base out there and if we
want to

73
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,590
a we don't want people to use our
project of course it must be a

74
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,020
easy to switch to our project project so
that's the reason why we try to at least

75
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,698
have a

76
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,139
school so transition to our project and
that's so something that

77
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,290
this a definitely use it her to a boat
today I'm

78
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,900
I know what else we did do for the
weekend of the configuration engine

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,590
because everybody the toothpick should
arm

80
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,409
knows that that's quite complicated to
set up as a lot of

81
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,810
options two sets and when we try to

82
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,190
from clean up to what has to be a
configured what not to and to what s

83
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,509
what can be already firm set with

84
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,350
default that the somehow a home Carter
said

85
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:13,060
the logical are most people need it in
that way from

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,880
next I would like to I'm expend some
feature highlights that we have found

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,389
that

88
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:23,289
fiction author does not offer one of
them is the SDF the replication for

89
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,630
St stands for storage daemon among them
though

90
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,020
picture and the burials system consists
of

91
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,219
three types of programs arguments that
are running

92
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,370
'em the the intelligent lies in the
director Demond

93
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,970
the five human us what other backup for
software vendors caulk science

94
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,530
and the starch demand a speed demon it's
a part of the software

95
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,530
that's right state of tool storage for

96
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,729
devices for example tapes are disks and
return back on restore

97
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,650
and I what we are now able to do it this
week and I'm replicate a backup for the

98
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,440
dumb 21

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,660
starch demon over the network to another
one which so

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,410
enables button us to a copy it over to
another building or something

101
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,530
which them but you know it's not able to
him

102
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,809
firm on make sure all you have to do the
restriction that's the truth or truth

103
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,550
that you want to migrate from from and
to have to be connected to the same

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,759
storage daemon

105
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,830
computer so you it's only more or less
possible to

106
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,520
replicate Oakley

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm a second earned a new feature that
we have a number real sand

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,669
one of those I think our own most
important and help so

109
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,729
firm administrator very much to use it
there's some

110
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,050
the so-called passive client the

111
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,169
the usual way of firm of initiating a
backup for the

112
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:59,229
run firm goes that way the director com
context for starch demand and term

113
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,870
tell for storage daemon that there will
be a back up someone from the file the

114
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,620
month

115
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,729
then the party may have contacted and
told to which starts chemo 2 a.m.

116
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,380
but I'm to send to date of and to the
five-member in shape for the connection

117
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,030
to the

118
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,520
term to the storage demand I'm this Hess

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,639
the but a lot of drawbacks a bonus if
you have a firewall or I'm not device

120
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,819
then the you cannot direct txs the
starting from the high demand but you

121
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:26,690
need to

122
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,009
I'm create an additional cost for
wanting more

123
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,780
um or things like that also often in the

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,489
them and then the company is so you have
the problem that the fire demon outside

125
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,800
or behind a firewall

126
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,919
does not have the same name resolution

127
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,289
which then you learn who makes the which
then gets to work hard you that cannot

128
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:53,568
connect to the other storage daemon

129
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,930
from with the passive client option we
are simply reverse to the

130
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,690
initiation of this data channel so that
means that now instead of for the fire

131
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,990
demon connecting

132
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,229
through the firewall to the storage
daemon um the connection is set up

133
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:13,370
the other way around and that fourth all
the problems so I'm that we had before

134
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,229
this means that some the five damon does
not need any

135
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,628
from name resolution anymore her and so

136
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,759
the firewall device does not need any
other

137
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,759
extra consideration so it's much easier
for setup

138
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,120
home for to a future that we have from
Marias firm

139
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,709
the third but we support the T old drive
software encryption

140
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,329
home since out to overcome for every
tape drive

141
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,120
firm has the included hardware
encryption

142
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,180
option so everybody that have a modern
out your drive has to the pool

143
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,969
opportunity already in this hot where
and we are now able to use its all

144
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,149
UK and at full speed a.m. hmmm encrypt
our backups on tapes

145
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,970
burned and bar else is able to create
and manage all those some

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,120
all I want is for you to use that so
every tapers a

147
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,120
encrypt with with the take specific Jeep

148
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,670
go yeah

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,449
what's up what is our open foster
strategy so um

150
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,990
the whole softwares a GPL version 3
licensed

151
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,190
firm the founders of the ovary of
project all are awesome

152
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,190
long a gotten a lot to say

153
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,459
but for a long time already are working
in the open source some

154
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,300
business so well we we r like group of
very much we think that's right way to

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,680
do things

156
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,899
we do not have any venture capital which
the

157
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,470
means that we can decide ourselves to
what what we want to do and what what we

158
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,380
do not to do or not to do

159
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,500
and we are not driven to make sure a
certain amount of money in a certain

160
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
amount of time so thats

161
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,510
what we see in other companies that are
half n checkup ito they

162
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,569
a they are driven adjust to make money
and they don't to the right decisions in

163
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,010
the hapa

164
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,560
than the project

165
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,459
has already set the from source code of
for memorial sits on the top with some

166
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,359
good how to conduct

167
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,360
com slash for realz so I'm we everything
that we have in our project if they are

168
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,579
so you can

169
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,510
take a daughter and look into it firm

170
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,160
the sauce go to if they are we have also
a regression tests on the sauce called

171
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,140
the pier on

172
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,250
close also in them though some poncho
for a repository

173
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,260
and the documentation is also they are
so I'm

174
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,000
everything's open

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,310
I think I'm

176
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,839
that we also have for third doctor
Jonathan source code documentation

177
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,230
from to will and we automatically from
run it on also scored so that term

178
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,510
because if somebody wants to drive into
the cold and see what did

179
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,660
das all what is called from where you
can easily

180
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,870
from home Road it get used to the courts
by it

181
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,350
reading the Duchess documentation

182
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,550
I so I hope that somebody either of you
owed some people are interested all

183
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,500
project and if you want to contribute or
project

184
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,860
'em you can go through the burials of
website there's on how to article

185
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,839
where most things are explain to where
you can contact us

186
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,620
per month we have to use of use a senate
Development Group 1 group

187
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,240
we have a backtrack on backstop a real
star or

188
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,730
and the source code is that get up

189
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,769
yeah but for I will answer or

190
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:00,320
of course no questions as long as I have
time for that but the numbers from time

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,420
across oh yeah we are here are we have a
stands & Gold Inc a level two

192
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,479
well you can come over and talk to us
and of course everybody's of wearing

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,970
a two-shot like I do as part of a
project so you can ask them and in time

194
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,519
her two of them are sitting there are
sold

195
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,700
just ask us okay I'm through so have

196
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,269
questions please yes well this is states
all

197
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,730
there'd be piped and barrio us

198
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,350
know what do you mean with state you do
we have it at compile-time

199
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,060
an adult in the pic I just does a truck
and other success stories cells be piped

200
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,130
yes it works okay thank you that

201
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:48,130
I that a question

202
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,329
we have another question the

203
00:12:54,329 --> 00:13:00,699
behind so I am am very curious about the
performance of her patio set can tell me

204
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,649
something about at the half benchmark so
metrics

205
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:09,870
album from Sina and I great skill the
you mean others that so what we do in

206
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,450
mud

207
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,630
I i have a um take to winning white
paper I we would to do with

208
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,649
tested to tape firm spirits andy is Tom
not block size of sexualized very slow

209
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,399
and if you were to increase the

210
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,040
books by author its gets much faster and
on the website of our elsewhere so

211
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,160
the or all the tests that I did and to
the analysis of that

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,500
can you firm I will submit the
throughput of the network and can you

213
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,100
feel that

214
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,040
sorry did nothing to prevent came to me
something about that

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,219
sorry did not they never got

216
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,380
the net against Evan be at the network
throughput eartha as far as that the

217
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,570
network work so it's it's not limited by
a by various itself

218
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,449
believe you me from the client is not
hot enough to %uh

219
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,660
2525 San to send them over the network
but

220
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,850
borrows itself is not good network of
the letter negatively

221
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,540
I have from unrelated question its
that's possible

222
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,349
so how do you solve the directories with
a million files

223
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,750
may need to back to them like a million
a small fast you I think you know the

224
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,750
problems with that

225
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,300
the efforts get too big right now I'm
not weird

226
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,939
in the end XO we we do the some
enumeration of a file so the

227
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,510
we just call a system to the call in the
end and if that takes too long

228
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,610
we cannot do nothing about that saw that
so we don't have a %uh ready solution

229
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,449
for that

230
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:39,399
okay second no problem the

231
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,480
good

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,430
there has been a nice feature request
list on the back and a website for

233
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,500
sitting far yes without anything moving
on it

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,620
when are the two things I i actually
related to the performance issues that

235
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,820
to personally asked about one is the
mountain Fredette 5 demand

236
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,829
from leading up to tries from the prior
system but you have nots

237
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,370
and capacitors miss horn size: you
submit that saturating the other night

238
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,389
storage device

239
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,449
and I want is to be able to spoon and
teaspoon concurrently

240
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,010
at the moment is systems images sit
around waiting problem

241
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,269
sourcing data from the client but it's
going to take

242
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,470
on a no plans to change this in the
service

243
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,529
temperature right now I'm not a

244
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,540
noncommittal about where we are in the
back a we also have for feature requests

245
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,010
so

246
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,180
if you have shared ideals of things that
should be

247
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,180
a done better she is so file them there
the french bulldog

248
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,248
that's the
