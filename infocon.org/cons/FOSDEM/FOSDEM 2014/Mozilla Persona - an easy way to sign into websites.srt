users

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,820
how the how it whole it is easy I like

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,840
and how but the board protocol %uh

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,580
books on this so umm wasn't it was an
hour

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,830
as they say ice made a week a sign in

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,720
us is to make single sign-on so up this
basically

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,750
I'll helps users to login

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,729
greatly assay on take you man

23
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,250
and it doesn't on get Bossa

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,340
so it's something pitches I defense
something in 10 on

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,009
so amino I closing in 10 on we need to

26
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,159
are actually I depend on

27
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,460
don't buy peace they in 102 a lot and
can't get it in stride

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,899
and it does too a share you later

29
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,490
up by this information like maybe like
up phone number

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,770
up late let's consider it an example
when

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,089
United the blogging a dolphin lapis work

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,930
like being at the site in us %uh you too
she ate

33
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,020
I information lacks the informational
creamy

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,470
and out for number ironed is so that

35
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,170
we get a lot of means and dick and bliss
annual audit

36
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,890
I think they're talking about mission
and it a little as it many privacy

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,519
issues

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,530
so like

39
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,060
I just showing the lake but the Penn
State of I was saying

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,819
so the this how the NEC in website it
asked are you to log in at the

41
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,988
the going on our Facebook oriental so
they know

42
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,489
say at these kinda it has become a
crisis

43
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,030
I mean even use in keitel log in my

44
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,500
it began so and at this is a mean person

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,590
main concern of the UN attacked events

46
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,360
information is being shared on a social
so

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,110
its intense I have a link lack of

48
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,879
so that we can lead to sign his

49
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,929
I use a muzzle up less than a %uh reach
actually helps you to sign the easy

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,590
just create an account a and next

51
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,000
the task you like I asks you to enter
your email at:

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,349
so %uh the police and army I'll takes

53
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,799
email at this as a unique values and
then persist for the login

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,370
so I you can I hate

55
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,750
so this is like a screenshot of

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,260
a hot meal %uh manage a email 80s

57
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,760
in I'll a browser so and

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,530
the support they brought a salad I most
emulation of iPod supported

59
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,319
and remaining on and I'll

60
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,399
as you know everyone know that I'll type
books a little

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,930
a must in a bipartisan accused a up I
feel so yes

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,950
and in fact we need only supports
displays an A

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,390
a singing sign on soul right be

64
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,720
have golf ok a specially on I developers
and my eighties

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
easy for them to implement this kind of
a

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,879
sign in system I saw

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,510
as they say all rights have it easy to
implement that make

68
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,798
about four steps are you just include
the

69
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,870
I'll the da scrip a high look back

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,680
and then but butt plug in lichens and
then they fight it

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,070
and that a so

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,099
I say to fit their protocol because I it
doesn't actually

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,210
ask you like to log in a layup it's like

74
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,710
a database only it unique values of
email eighties it doesn't want any other

75
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,460
information

76
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,599
so we know you just I give you a
Canadian login

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,720
it actually validates up if it if you

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
uniquely mid-80s at the dojo dot com so
it and done

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,719
us you for the first time Luginbill
Yahoo

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,080
and then it actually %uh text me that
the mid-eighties existing

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,389
and made it is up act or not and then

82
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,919
I don't back to your site and then it's
login and I just ate

83
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,770
but Inc I it helps not bushy a
delightful as an

84
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,758
and Privacy Information into another
sites and

85
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,020
I you don't need to start by six and out

86
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,500
you don't need to rely on dogged by
piece so

87
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,970
again at this internet emanates that
decision farm

88
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,509
me know you visit any lips 8 its a
highway to register every state and

89
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:22,160
keeping

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,300
a in memory that and each every website

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,070
I did not getting back so it's very
difficult and sometimes they ask to use

92
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,490
an enzyme going to ask but

93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,940
I use 1880 so it's it's like a
complicated

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,940
so these are I just listen I like but in
the name is that a decision

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,900
and other stuff so again its opening

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,929
and overnight I use this blows and I'm
going to simply a rape site

97
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,259
you don't need to I mean not there is a
about submission of battery

98
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,590
the an explosion of I desist from
religious

99
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,580
you don't need to take it off but again

103
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,389
the effect on a person's like you can't
a change as you

104
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,910
are you X you want and in I it's like
that again and I'll everything like

105

158
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,880

email at: and

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,010

161
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,709
I like the it you the certificate

162
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,518
and then its mandate I'll

163
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,640
so I this is something Lake over you
like

164
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,730
where you at I use a great you log in
and from I tend to prefer it provided it

165
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,220
is like gladiator and then

166
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,220
you can just log into the website I just
show your day Mon Dec

167
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,099

then we can

173
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,180
so it's it's not asking anybody for
anything and this

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,310
the I'm not mad so it's

175
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,640

25 ek

228
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,620
yaa

229
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,230
yeah

230
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,230
and yeah

231
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,090
up

232
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,440
Lake I don't understand

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,790
ok and that means to see Lake

234
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,349
I

235
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:01,350
its

236
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:08,650
up

237
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,119
I I think I can answer this question you
can

238
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
go to logging upper Sonando dark and you
can there Clark clear older

239
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,449
persona laurence so that it will not let
you in any more

240
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,130
so you can I think not yet

241
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,870
there still thinking about that when you
run your personal

242
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,870
identity provider then you could take
down your identity provider to

243
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,199
do something like it and that would
probably work so for example I have my

244
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,760
own ideas

245
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,240
me and him I'm want to revoke any
certificates are out there for me

246
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,900
I could take down my ID p2 prevents
people from limine with those

247
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,900
certificate signed with mine earlier
private key

248
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:18,020
yes

249
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,709
yeah

250
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,520
yes the question

251
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,570
alone question for you the question was

252
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,030
that you said that since I didn't
providers are bound to do

253
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,399
domain for the email address and we just
showed logging in

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,370
with gmail the question is if purse if
Google supports persona and the answer

255
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:43,620
is

256
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,429
it does not directly but to persona team
has built a couple

257
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,740
rages that allow using the guru of

258
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,160
a API to a

259
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,620
act as a night in steeper fired so
you're really log into

260
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,459
gmail dot large enough personae .org and
idk uses Gmail

261
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,960
the ice to reuse their credentials

262
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,100
and that works for you Yahoo and gmail
today

263
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,100

264

293
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,910
in the world

294
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,770
so not sure where that comes from I am

295
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,139
but anyway let's go through this nice
and quick at

296
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,120
because there's a whole bunch
interactive things as are you on orders

297
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,489
can be

298
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,230
wing whatever you want at the computer
screens

299
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,420
the whole time I'm going on force you to
engage with other people

300
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,070
min force you here to actually go and
make a connection with someone

301
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,070
whether you like it or not so just a
heads up those if you got laptops out

302
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,360
in about 23 minutes

303
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,850
you're gonna want to have those things
of the desks for their safety

304
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,169
so as I mentioned

305
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,540
I work for these guys you probably know
them because at this thing but I work on

306
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,050
this thing

307
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,149
so mozilla is built on four pillars
activity

308
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,350
which art when this license is moving
build

309
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,320
empower teach in shape now fine as
mother's place activity was this got to

310
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,590
do a participation

311
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,889
well Mozilla exists because a
participation

312
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,980
and through all of the papers I've been
meeting over the past few months before

313
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,950
doing this talk

314
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,400
you can start to spot these things
occurring everywhere

315
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,560
and these don't just occur with Mozilla
these kinds of activities also

316
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,980
appear within the Ubuntu community
within Linux within

317
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,310
most every open source community in the
world so

318
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:40,030
why are they so important an and what is
this participation

319
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:44,050
thing that I keep mentioning close
participation is a word that some people

320
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,080
don't lost its way you may think you'll

321
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,110
participating with people you may think
you are making it easy for people to

322
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,330
participate but %um

323
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,629
might not so

324
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,080
Henry Jenkins who is a professor at UC

325
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,899
at USC said this in the middle one other
papers and it just kind of stood out to

326
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,180
me

327
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,230
but strict that lead lap language while

328
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,310
participatory culture shift the focus on
literacy from one individual

329
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,379
1 individual expression to community
involvement

330
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,830
so participatory culture

331
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,350
is imbedded in the rooms the open source
culture

332
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,449
you can't have one without the other so

333
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,120
let's do a quick demonstration about
open source cultural works because

334
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,590
we tryin making easy other people's to

335
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,490
be produced things and do their own
thing with the same code base

336
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,880
so let's look as good impression affect

337
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,980
I'm gonna have to let Mike goes on a
shout at you

338
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,500
so my apologies for shouting at you I
don't want to be mean but

339
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,830
technology be state

340
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,629
the what I want to do want to follow the
law his ball

341
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,390
back on

342
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,080
over

343
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,080
here long

344
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:23,200
up

345
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,780
up

346
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,629
so that's an example if not designing
for participation while designing for

347
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,520
participation

348
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,070
I got you all to get involved but you
all got it long

349
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,760
now why well I didn't tell you exactly
what I was doing

350
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,360
I showed you but you want looking for it
because of explicitly saying

351
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,590
hey there's this step the I'm not gonna
tell you about

352
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,959
but you have to do it so I'm not gonna
tell you that step

353
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,970
right now I'll let you try and work out
and if you want to know the answer later

354
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,840
comment by me

355
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,220
but what we gonna do this time is due

356
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,600
another example but this time it's
designing for participation

357
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,149
that goes well and acts exactly as it
suppose to

358
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:20,110
who's had a thumb war couple people you
know where you get it comes in

359
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,290
you i will like this we have two people
you have one person and another person

360
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,270
and you tryin keep their thumb down for
five seconds

361
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,470
and the person whose name is on top wins
now there's

362
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,840
there's a there's amassed engaged
version of this cold

363
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,980
well massive multi-player on wall

364
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,440
and this this will invoke a number love
emotions all at the same time confusion

365
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,310
excitement

366
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,470
anger I hopefully not violence

367
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,000
I book what we're going to try and have
a go at this

368
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,290
so I like just a couple people who are
kinda at the edges

369
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,490
down him to pick on you guys to the at
the edge and your clothes that you can

370
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,880
come up

371
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,230
and we're gonna try and recreate that so
you guys can see how the hands

372
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,290
fit together and then what I want you to
do is only to reach out

373
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,920
to as many different people that you
can't physically Beach even if you have

374
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,070
to stretch across the

375
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,570
its we're gonna have a giant game and
the winner is

376
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,470
gonna be the people that win the far
more with both hands

377
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,690
so objects iight but mention we have two
hands so we can play two at the time

378
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,280
I A the other thing is it doesn't have
to just be you know a poll

379
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,060
it can be unit was maybe please you like
because we know these things would

380
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,800
networks lightning had cluster Zimmerman

381
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,810
well we got a couple a group says it
could be a big one here

382
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,320
no doubt this will be going to be a big
one up towards the back there

383
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,810
there's gonna be a couple have kinda
people like

384
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,409
stuck in the middle but let's just try
and get his hand just down so

385
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,910
in the budget can see all four hands
low-balling about each other

386
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,830
so sticky fingers out straight always
with the same hand so

387
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,699
everyone I had it and then close them up

388
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,680
okay and then you get a thumb for more
so the bomb what

389
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,590
historically only starts when someone
counts that counts in

390
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:14,590
okay and that this does not have me to
come and talk to a lot of other wise so

391
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,000
3 to one go

392
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,320
I and that's cheating

393
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,889
and this could go on for awhile so
before someone break something up here

394
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,210
laptops put them somewhere safe don't
just leave them on the table to get

395
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,170
knocked off

396
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,240
but I now want you two times was many
people as you can you have two hands

397
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,140
stretch outs and have a go this time

398
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,880
I have told you every possible step so
if you lose is just because you're back

399
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:50,880
it

400
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,280
I wanna see a connection from this group
at the front all the way up to the back

401
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,280
you are getting away with it because you
all the way back there

402
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,309
Mon start yet he hasn't had the
countdown home

403
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,168
i've seen. modes up to 10 her hands
together

404
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:25,169
terrifying but possible

405
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:39,699
if there's an ends that doesn't connect
to anything just like you abound

406
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,929
furiously but you won't win with it

407
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:48,649
I okay

408
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:51,979
everyone Merry I'm gonna give you a
minute's

409
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,649
okay you have one minute to be everyone
else in your palm or and remember you

410
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,439
got two hands to try and focus on both
at the same time

411
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,539
it might help okay on the count of three

412
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:10,539
to one stable

413
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,970
as soon as you wait a min the handy when
would shudder in the air

414
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,809
and that's spam and doesn't count still

415
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,879
ok dump

416
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,519
the one with the high and if you in with
your right hand stick your hand in the

417
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,130
happy when we have plans to get left out
in the FU in with both

418
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:45,130
do the a jewel of and

419
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,720
time's up but the one with your right
hand but you're right hand in the air

420
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,149
if you've already left and secure left
hand in the air

421
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:03,529
if you want with bows do the order of
whip

422
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:08,549
okay so hey we've actually learns a
couple things at the same time I have

423
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:10,570
explained it to you guys explicitly

424
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,769
which is bomb but I'm going to do that
now

425
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:17,179
withhold from kinda the take you

426
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:21,029
seen techie world here whether WYD
Coda's all

427
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:25,269
we just fight about this stuff or we
just like to make people look stupid

428
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:30,029
like I do what we've actually Inc
engaged in here is not only

429
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,799
connecting with people 121 and starting
to get a little bit and

430
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,658
over an idea about who they are you can
kinda tell if someone's gonna cheat

431
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:40,690
they're not so a passing you want to let
play the game with you again

432
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,149
but we've also started slowing about
networks

433
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,178
so we can use physical activities to
explain

434
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:50,470
digital things so a network is

435
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,330
as we know a moment with another mod
another mod connected somehow

436
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,970
now we did that using of what is mom's
and

437
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,289
that's just one piece of digital
literacy and

438
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,840
digital literacy is there's a lot of
them there's not one single

439
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,869
digital literacy there's a whole bunch
from hardware to electronics

440
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:15,669
to coding to binary to you name it
exists

441
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,429
web literacy is just one of these
digital literacies and that's the other

442
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,490
thing I work on

443
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:24,178
not the other thing in the tight love
this talk so

444
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,990
what is web literacy how do we do some
kinda demonstration at that because the

445
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,560
webiste

446
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,750
coded runs in the browser well I'm gonna
I'm gonna try

447
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,500
but I'm gonna try and at the same time
slot to demonstrate appointment to make

448
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,040
a bet

449
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,940
so there's this group called hyper
Island

450
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,168
and may do the same they had this entire
Bible called

451
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,270
the Energizer Bible and

452
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,960
energizes the better job in so let's
explain that dog am cuz

453
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,139
it could mean a number things it doesn't
mean

454
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,020
batteries or the energizer bunny like
but not connected to this

455
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,300
but an energizer is an energy booster
okay so

456
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,339
sitting in here all day laptop
reasonably low energy

457
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,960
from wall doing that orkut jewel of

458
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,450
they use of energy and they also

459
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,549
raise your energy levels because you
have to start using some you because I

460
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,599
might need mall

461
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:26,119
inflows into your system so you can read
I'm not gonna be there all to you at the

462
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,050
slides will be online later so you can
look them up later if you want

463
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:35,140
but we gonna play the shouting game so
this has been fairly quiet we made a bit

464
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,160
of noise now

465
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
let's make a lot of noise my one shot
into the mic fine I promise

466
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,040
but the way we gonna play this is the
shouting chemist

467
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,150
very simple in principle everyone stop
shouting as loud as they can

468
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,160
for two minutes that's it that's the
whole game

469
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,549
but I'm gonna I'm gonna hack on this

470
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,420
so something that what you've heard
something that you've heard in a

471
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,430
several other presentations before me
and you may hear in some other

472
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,710
presentations of to

473
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,150
is this what remix remix is embedded
within this because

474
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,710
the type that led them icon to my own
language today remixes embedded

475
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,099
within participatory culture like is
taking

476
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,730
an idea making a change and running with
it

477
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,579
so the change on making is I don't want
to shell

478
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:27,750
random things because that's what the
game a question anything just noise

479
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,170
all I want you to start listing as many
web related things as you can as loud as

480
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,750
you can for two minutes

481
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,040
so I hate mail CSS JavaScript start
listing properties if you run out of

482
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,619
ideas start listing like things like
closures

483
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,170
this particular program if it violates
the webshow to

484
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,329
sup his cuteness

485
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,299
who's got a big voice who think they're
gonna be heard over this noise

486
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:57,770
this guy arstan third away from him and

487
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,569
so on the council for me

488
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:05,040
I want you to with loud as you can okay
I want them to hear us

489
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,670
in keep a building I wanted to shout

490
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,109
as many different things about CSS as
you can among the shortness down to a

491
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:13,690
minute again

492
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,390
so it might help if you stand up it
might not

493
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,950
I'll leave it to you but there is a
little month but

494
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,290
but it's like typically put in twenty
stand-up you get a bit more space be a

495
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,109
diaphragm you can make a loud noise

496
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,270
loud noisy fun so

497
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,349
on the count of three start listing as
many things as you can

498
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:36,890
as loud as you can 3 to

499
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:43,890
one altogether

500
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,029
the

501
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,560
the over the doc a color

502
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,560
the

503
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,290
be okay

504
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,140
good my

505
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,470
what does sausages have to do with the
web

506
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,549
ok the okay

507
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,380
person of shaw's in I think we've
definitely

508
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,400
to have applied anyone wanting to come
into this room so

509
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,280
well done I am we might have to go on
say is OK

510
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,630
is okay we're not gonna kill you when
you comin I

511
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,340
II sausages guy might spur would

512
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,680
whatever so how does tights web literacy
well

513
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,589
you all set a lot of different things
and able to do with the web and web

514
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,510
literacy is the understanding of things

515
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,650
on the web or thing how the WebWorks

516
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,720
and so on and so forth but trying to
pick out the individual words are saying

517
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,480
the same time with each other while
shouting it's

518
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,890
what I to get your one point across is
incredibly hard

519
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,690
I only heard sausages the waits till the
end I only had CSS cuz he waited till

520
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,450
the end

521
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,850
and no one else showed up but that's not
how the world works when his continual

522
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,610
content continual voices going out and
trying to get hurt

523
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,040
and thats good that's what it should be

524
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,520
but then these to be a way for people
that don't understand these things

525
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,400
to map this out to trying work out
what's

526
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,330
cut a key to knowing how Web Works and
then from there they can move on and

527
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,830
stop shouting themselves

528
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,319
meetings not make a loud noise we can
start have a bigger impact

529
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,410
so this is the web literacy map

530
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,720
I'm not gonna go into detail it's
something that was created by Mozilla

531
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,939
to try matter how what you need to know
to be wetter

532
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,920
you've got columns which are strands and
they were late to three things exploring

533
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,560
building

534
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,080
and connecting and within those you've
got things like navigation search

535
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,370
privacy I dunno if you can see you on
this claim like on

536
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,040
I so don't look this up but this

537
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,880
is a good way to map things out look
like this

538
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,850
if we had a love you what do you think
you said in a big list

539
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,009
we'd end up with something like that
this is just Bugzilla by chose this

540
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,990
because the lady you a code to the
bloody within a team like this

541
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,120
try to engage maybe not well but I'm
trying

542
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,410
good and this this is hard

543
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:24,569
I am for someone whose brand new trying
to get involved with something like this

544
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,720
kinda terrifying you've got these

545
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,430
things here that mean something in the
email addresses what's in them

546
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,730
and lookbook what's going on here what's
assault

547
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,980
I think they are I'm them a better ways
to do it

548
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,110
the but that you people like

549
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,900
osco does we love this stuff this is
pining for us

550
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,800
for someone trying to get into this area
as much trying to be calm web literature

551
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,900
was digitally let digitally little its

552
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,620
or just getting bolt terrifying you're
gonna hate me in a second

553
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,270
yup so josh Matthews

554
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,660
created this wonderful tool which kinda
digest it down a bit

555
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,740
well I say bit a lot but it does in a
good way

556
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,370
it's really simple the call to action is
really clear

557
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,140
like what's your favorite programming
language we can launch that question

558
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,319
new people maybe not as much but if
they've had a little bit

559
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,720
bit of coding experience they probably
have a bit of an opinion that

560
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,370
will they do look having opinions and
then it says tell me more boring

561
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,730
well I clicked tell me more cuz I know a
better job good luck on like it

562
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,970
so I get to see a look there's this

563
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:41,600
this thing I can get involved with and
filial I can go and explore that more

564
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,339
likely than I had a like that what they
are

565
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,920
don't madonna is built on what the hell
do that stuff I look it's ugly

566
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,220
sleeves just completely oblivious as
okay I do know it

567
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,629
so this is a globule see

568
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,610
a lot when it comes to contribution
you've got

569
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,980
bassists is time contributed so

570
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,280
a lot do you guys are probably in this
area so you know how to talk to these

571
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,860
people

572
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,530
these guys can look after themselves you
don't have to try and engage with these

573
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,130
people

574
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,950
has with much gusto you don't have to
China

575
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,830
dumb things down which you don't have to
do for anyone but I'll get onto that

576
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,440
but these guys they know Bugzilla

577
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,510
or they know get home issues they'd like
looking at it because they understand

578
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,700
how it works

579
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,390
these guys a little up then you've got
the people who are slightly less litem

580
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,460
and weak weak weak on a good at dealing
with those people

581
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,930
with week I never came I'm once a new
code comes up you might have a

582
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,169
ham this question again

583
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,320
well at least wants the questions

584
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,440
wit with okay many then there's this in
time on sticking unabomb

585
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,230
with very bad helping these people I

586
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:07,020
anyone is very bad at this even if you
tried to do it yeah very bad at it

587
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,040
but this this club is not a problem

588
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,470
this is what you should see the Pueblo
is if this is BB state

589
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:20,040
this is a really steep climb anyone have
a couple people who led to a

590
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,230
the guys done this and another gonna
have a we can clue what you're talking

591
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,450
about

592
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,330
they want to know what you mean when you
start talking about C compilers

593
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,900
that is gonna look at you and I'll up
%uh on

594
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,640
love and news in a moment

595
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,930
but so what you wanna do is try and get
the shuttle Cup

596
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,430
a shuttle at home is very easy to
achieve it doesn't mean bombing things

597
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:44,839
down

598
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,750
it means removing job in like I had the
energy I the slide up

599
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,360
and it had a word bees a job in that
which you now know you now know what

600
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
energizer means

601
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,410
copper exploration I explained what that
piece a job in men

602
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:03,270
base is simply a good good way to go
paid

603
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,560
we do a lot of things what are you
interested in

604
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,200
so you ask the question you try and work
out stuff

605
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,540
said work out where u best put them in
time served

606
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,779
this is the nephew the community you may
be interested in getting involved in

607
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,600
that's close to show that come about
because the start to go on to their

608
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,710
playing field

609
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,990
they start you start to move people from
the bottom in da club

610
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,029
into the middle was in the middle is
easier to move the

611
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,200
up to the end and the club starts to
shuttle itself out

612
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,759
automatically you don't have to do much
work to make that happen

613
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,530
thirty-seconds enough a how long does it
take to buy a new thing for this like

614
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,040
new question

615
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,390
thirty-seconds Ste say

616
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,779
so this is good

617
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,120
this is also good this is good for
people at the end

618
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,290
this is good for people at the top

619
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,779
and he's we don't need to be afraid to
the people at the end

620
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,780
what we need to be is considered an
understanding that they don't understand

621
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,210
all the technical terms we're using all
the time

622
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,220
they might have a good glossed basic

623
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,480
web development for example like they
haven't okayed cost at making web page

624
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,300
it looks kinda okay

625
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,870
and it does something useful but when
you start flowing times at them but

626
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,540
they've never heard before

627
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,029
that's not gonna help national pushing
back at the other end

628
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:30,510
what you want to do is when you throw
one of those times at them if you get up

629
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,780
look back then you need to start
explaining things

630
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,670
I and you don't have to dumb it down
just stop buying well this one word

631
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,700
could be explained by five words without
losing any meaning or context

632
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,730
use the pipe words

633
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,780
so that's been African proverb that says

634
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,750
if you want to go fast go along if you
want to go full of go together

635
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,490
that doesn't mean that your project has
to go slow we've already sold for that

636
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:58,740
with open source

637
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,109
we have this thing schoolkids wonderful
version control in general

638
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,800
it allows people to take the bits that
they had to work on do it quickly

639
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,380
at their own pace and send it back but
the people that are doing the slowest of

640
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,640
they can go with a slower pace without
having

641
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,980
any real impact on bed learning

642
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,070
understanding so

643
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,900
mark Simon who is the thing to do at
supper Muslim foundation

644
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,420
I said this and it's quite I've used in
you mister presentations but it has a

645
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,800
a men's meeting piece in it which is
that the power on the web

646
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,700
is the idea anyone can make so anyone
anyone including the people at the

647
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,259
bottom of the glove down there

648
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,570
they can make anything for the web Mike

649
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,120
we always be wet makers and that doesn't
just mean let's make things The web

650
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,799
it means we need to help other people
make things for the web as well

651
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,030
and this applies to things like seeking
pilots it is placed web thing

652
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,530
under sticking with it but literally
stopped because that's why no

653
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,890
and hopefully you now know a little bit
more about that as well as a little bit

654
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,960
more about how to design

655
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,300
participation so I'm gonna have but one
was light

656
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,940
boy it as equation I did steal a slight

657
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,210
but I mentioned who it was at the bottom
and that the link so you can go watch

658
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,470
the entire talk

659
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:19,259
sante did sleet is really worth watch

660
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,370
especially if you like we meet saying
talk nerdy to me

661
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:27,920
that the the thing that a lot but its
it's pretty simple

662
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,720
take a science which is you conan
whatever remove bullet points in job in

663
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,080
cuz

664
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,299
looking a bullet points on slides on the
web pages unless they're short and

665
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,810
concise horrible

666
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,590
divide by relevance and that means only
give the

667
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,790
information is useful okay so we'll move
anything

668
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,630
is in Pelham times by your passion

669
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,780
your site in the room in the middle %uh
bustles

670
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,880
coming few days knows how far away
because you're passionate about your

671
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,780
project

672
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,490
represent night in your explanations and
that will make a better understanding

673
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,080
and better understanding is better
participation and that means moving

674
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,720
people from the bottom of the curve

675
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,770
towards top the club and show you how

676
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,130
so questions i'd

677
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,870
got five minutes max yes

678
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,790
someone get a microphone to him before
he starts asking me things no one else

679
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,070
can hear

680
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,440
because that wouldn't be good for passes
know that that that participation

681
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,640
them that's a hard word to say sometimes

682
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,879
into the am a.m. is the

683
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,970
mmm slide with just saw why did you
divide by heavens

684
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,089
I divide by relevance I E identified by
the defense because that's what

685
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,110
individual slight

686
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:44,680
I think a better thing to happen I would
be divide by unknown relevance

687
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,850
so get me to the stuff that isn't
relevant to the conversation

688
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,009
so if the or try to talk about a closure
for example in javascript

689
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,390
don't start going on and how you can use
these things

690
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,980
make for the meaty crazy stuff on the
cutting edge before you've explained

691
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,180
what it actually does

692
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,440
do the explaining firstly the relevant
stop first

693
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,610
you can get on to the other stuff later
Conway

694
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,540
any others

695
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,500
no other only floating around in here
for

696
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,720
at least another two talks so you can
come by me 0

697
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:26,720
yep actually get a microphone down here
101

698
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,299
long way Mount so you've got the number
of contributors here so this is like

699
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,850
1000 millions of people

700
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,210
and you got the amount of time a
contributing the people they're

701
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,430
contributing a lil all the time

702
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,560
would typically middle caveats but will
typically have a good understanding

703
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,710
already

704
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,880
because if you don't have an
understanding something

705
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,110
you to be made it home in person to keep
trying to do that

706
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:09,520
and I'll the the general rule is people
often have that patience

707
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,720
anyone else

708
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,779
no okay

709
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,370
so by run through these as quickly as I
can they resist

710
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:28,370
slide at the back for you I'll come on
move quickly so you can get in touch

711
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,750
with me at the email address at the
bottom

712
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:39,750
I yeah and I'm out here %ah

713
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,070
you have two minutes to sing us a song
if you want

714
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,600
no nugget

715
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,009
week did
