1
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:27,140
hmm okay so now let's talk about the Web
Audio

2
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,779
thank you for coming out arm the present
our

3
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:36,230
is simply one of my favorite employees
in Mozilla

4
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,419
arm because is very very nice

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,360
and I just regret the fact that he has
decided to have a beard

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,610
but that's his choice it

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,070
so yes the

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,040
the so it's not appeals for me and so
police is a media developer at Mozilla

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,070
hebron only works on the old your

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,780
output but cans for various platforms
and on the web old you'll

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,119
annie is a big big fan all all what is
dealing with music

12
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:15,119
so please welcome bowen the the

13
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,550
a check for second it might produce
workplace

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,439
them space in exile

15
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,449
I am playing mp3's

16
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,930
if that's the problem

17
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:39,009
up Norman

18
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,630
to hear something

19
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,839
yeah

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,409
it so this was a VLC is brilliant up

21
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,420
so today the

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,869
going to suck without you because that's
basically what I've been doing

23
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,899
since a year ago I guess meaning

24
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,929
mostly thats so

25
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:11,180
a year ago was there in this exact same
room

26
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,200
exact same place hours a saying stuff

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,510
like so we lost a spate game which
implements

28
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,720
0 no art

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,390
yet alluring yes I

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,140
not too good K

31
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,859
huh the next works no actually

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,510
doesn't Kat I'll

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,720
part

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,250
full screen

35
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,870
reso

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,500
as in this room hours just telling
everybody that we lost the

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,750
the spec games there's the people
brightest thank you SO respect people

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,239
don't like to specs are you lose

39
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,319
seasons in turn those dog other guys

40
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,819
back so we had to go do they take the
ice pack which was extremely simply

41
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,149
could write the same data

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,890
in javascript the to the speaker's
basically nothing more

43
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,190
people kinda liked it but people
preferred Google

44
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,690
API which was the way we take your I'm
so we we sweet weeks

45
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,209
we were will like II so we have concern
is we look to spec

46
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,549
he was extremely sad because it was the
user manual

47
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,019
was not spec so like it was like

48
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,940
almost there is a functioning does kinda
thats we had no

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,690
clue how we should do it so we had to
read a lot of capsules gooden's

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,530
that figure 8 and reverse engineer the
spec which was interesting

51
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,239
a so we headed behind the press a

52
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,889
it was doing absolutely nothing a year
ago

53
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,590
I said like we were close to actually a
good sound which seems pretty important

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,489
but don't work the done thing was
alright

55
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,019
was kinda working week past buffers
around did

56
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,310
did not ok no stop the right side

57
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,269
right

58
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,570
so when was it a

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,810
Friday August yeah last day of

60
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,360
August 2012 s on

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,460
push the first commit which was
basically

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,870
or the reason you if she can call in
school mose

63
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,020
larger context a

64
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,530
800 commits after

65
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,619
we have a future complete and validation
that works on

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,820
runs a bunch of tests on most the demo
is out there

67
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,690
so as you can see

68
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,020
so this is the time line up the commits
this is where we

69
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,740
really started working on it and this is
worshipped

70
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,659
like learned everything and go home

71
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,870
so and those trickle server has been
shipped for

72
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,950
I S two releases maybe three Noah I
speak

73
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,159
spree good in France missus demos
without a problem Boise games

74
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,659
so im talking the games

75
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:20,719
a what's all the use cases for web 02
APR

76
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,810
before talking how to do it first and
foremost

77
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,300
game developers web frustrated the using
only owed a tax because

78
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,159
was not greats like you can do special
positioning

79
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,060
effects and stuff like that USX the X I
mean you couldn't

80
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,940
rights didn't %um without such an API

81
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,800
music is a ship visualization guys busy

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,289
you play an mp3 and you have a lil Dre
of moving

83
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,740
and say oh you there is lot of bass
stuff application feedback we use that

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,750
Firefox OS for example when you

85
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,349
he the keyboard it goes tick tick tick
tick tick

86
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,159
like a typewriter um musical occasions

87
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:08,620
people don't resist things where you
just have pros and they do music

88
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,539
like you could use an other softwares
but since you also have the ability to

89
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,200
see in

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,779
servers and network and like everything
you can do crazy stuff

91
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,020
a Francis streaming music player

92
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,200
so maybe you've heard of made a the

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,279
the old may go the new media uploads can
stuff

94
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,360
so they have a new music streaming
service that is whether you're

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,039
in distance interesting ways to be able
to play flack

96
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,909
the format on the web which in it's not
possible

97
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,300
normally but they the run the decoder

98
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,310
in a worker and then I bet to evaluate
the lines

99
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,529
its insane but works its

100
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:51,860
it's insane it's free mice in the
battery though

101
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,430
work as I N

102
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,779
so yeah the proper way to do that would
be to use two major source

103
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:03,779
extension butts it's only available in
chrome I guess maybe

104
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,149
maybe the Safari a wicked stuff but I'm
not too sure

105
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,039
so we have a most of the missiles such
an

106
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,560
a but it's not enable right now because
sentenced

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,330
and specialty steels and ideally

108
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,140
anything that should make noise butts a
me that might be some problem along the

109
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,570
way

110
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,409
so what can you do with whoever you API

111
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:31,899
you can say Canara buffer that contains
some

112
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:36,300
some buffer that is an old file or mp3
file whatever

113
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,630
format a your browser supports decodes
it tonight or about four so you can

114
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,440
gets to wat PCM file out of an mp3 file

115
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,180
which is pretty cool precise timing of
something so in

116
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,180
say join a game and you want to trigger
a like a

117
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,140
ish shotgun whatever and with the way
with you if you're in

118
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,089
extremely accurate timing control over
the timing

119
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,190
which is important you can also they are
sounding a simple accurate manner

120
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,399
so if you need exactly two sounds to be
triggered either exact same times

121
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,690
same time then it's very easy to do

122
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,490
I arbitrary or $0.10 mixing as you'll
see in the future of the demos coming up

123
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,250
effects transitions killing should Ling
so issue have

124
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,940
a for example he favored a note we'll
see you in a minute

125
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,039
gay nude lets you change the volume of
something you can say oh

126
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,949
from time t2 eighty-plus 30 seconds on
this game to rank

127
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,580
you know exponential passion a from 0 to
1

128
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,729
for example to to make a song that goes
up

129
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,950
as with a nice smooth girl

130
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,089
so single as CSS animation assesses ices
animations but for you

131
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,240
for example you can analyze Ojo so get

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,850
for you transform for those in the know
to get it for you transform and display

133
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,100
it

134
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,200
little bar graph like display the

135
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,899
average volume in stuff like that

136
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:08,260
integration with the web platform so
we'll see how we can hook up with 40 °c

137
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,069
or get is a major or major recorder to a
rodeo

138
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,360
API is extremely easy thanks to you

139
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,779
people were designed i sleepy eyes and
low latency playback so in

140
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,160
I miss lee dental person will be busy
for beanies latency play

141
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
at some point and the it was kind of

142
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,850
possible before but not really with the
API and shows that's

143
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,820
the sounds goes from the buffer to you
speakers

144
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,480
the fastest possible so

145
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,350
how does it work so including the spec

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,810
I basically you have no its you connect
the nodes and

147
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,839
output of a node goes in the up with the
other nodes and then at the end you have

148
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,190
sink which is the speakers basically

149
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,339
week and we will see that there is all
the types of sync but

150
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,430
yeah basic your sources you have a
person in a meal

151
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,649
60 the an and then you have some or you
can record it's all

152
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,029
send it to with LTC

153
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,230
so it goes like this: ago ok where would
you graph

154
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,200
on the left I've got the the code that
produces it on right so it's extremely

155
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
easy always himself

156
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,849
you get new context like you would do
for any API basically

157
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,350
I show you how to decode a note file

158
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,079
you got it from the chro- whatever

159
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,899
you you put it to be going to die to it
does the magic

160
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,200
gives you a buffer back using the call
box it to sink synchronous

161
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,750
it doesn't is a opens on another thread
dozen

162
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,290
killer performance so it's is just nice

163
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,029
then you create both the source you you
put the buffer in the buffer source

164
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,529
and then you do mishmash of connecting
and setting

165
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,529
our mares and you end up with this graph

166
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,189
and then you can say start and you will
start to output sound and we'll

167
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,269
you will go and get processed by the
Linode going to dig a no go back in the

168
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,360
day they know to get feedback loop

169
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,920
and they need will eventually at some
point going the distinction note and at

170
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,170
at this point you have some so I'm
actually not sure what

171
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,849
so there is a to there there was this
will be terrible

172
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,180
but like you feel it but nonsense butts

173
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,800
anyway you there is the more I can show
you after that

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
so source noted what you can do like
well the song

175
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,628
come come from basically so we take on
Form with the RTC just use a major

176
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,970
surgeon say for example your microphone
all the microphone of the guy or the

177
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,449
other

178
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,709
and other capabilities the connection
tied up into about your

179
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,378
for example you can give yourself a bra
but voice which is kinda cool

180
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,430
on you can play a buffer

181
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,930
so this is basically you have a sample
and you want to plate

182
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,939
as is yes stuff um

183
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,248
because the buffer is too good in
advance it will it will be

184
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:06,420
extremely fast to play so we don't have
to do anything so

185
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,019
we just play all samples or slater node

186
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,149
is busy did you assign way square wave
so too

187
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,499
whatever a you can't set an arbitrary
waveform I it

188
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:23,519
a script processing nodes lets you right
arbitrary JavaScript

189
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,860
and right into a buffer and then gets
played the new gets call back

190
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,810
whenever it needs your data but we will
see why is broken

191
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,849
and major element body a source node
which is a mouthful

192
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,589
I'm your biz taken did you order the
men's

193
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,050
by Peter into a merger when you do that
the song is not

194
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,050
output in the speaker's you basically
bypass the normal output to the media

195
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,540
the mint

196
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:53,089
and type even to about you so you can
actually apply processing or something

197
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,680
then you can process the inputs you have
for example

198
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,349
easiest is I a player game

199
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,470
showed a gain of 0.5 then

200
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,490
is like you have helped the volume basic

201
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,189
you can you can said to more than one
want to bring stability in

202
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:15,748
delano basically delays in time the
invites say showed a one-second

203
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,050
your rights some sound the laying in
wait a bit

204
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,079
what's one second and then outfits to
some

205
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,888
which is extreme you schools will see
screw process nodes

206
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,430
again a it's broken support you too much
I mean is broken

207
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,498
perspex not in a condition problem but
the the script was snowed

208
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:37,110
lets you writes a better just compresses
data

209
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,160
other node extremely useful for games
let's use sets 2.23 points

210
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,420
and the sound and their speed as well

211
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,920
so that the sound gets pounding you in
your speakers or headphones

212
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,449
the respectively to the related position
at the two points

213
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:57,189
and if the points are moving to get
Doppler effect for free in like 10

214
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,689
starts a text me

215
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:04,379
interesting and the thats business for
games

216
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,959
up and then child Splinter Cell measure

217
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,268
a so that's when you have a stir a file
but what process

218
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,529
left and right channel in two different
ways to split

219
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:20,160
the the file and can who kept a
different parts of the draw of

220
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,790
Soria the Spree just for you to use you
know it control node

221
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,540
so one-dimensional convolution basically
it's like

222
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,269
issuing a church in you talk and then
there is we've that's basically what it

223
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,089
is you can do all the stuff with us the
most

224
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,120
a yeah that's the most natural

225
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,170
way of putting it again there will be
demoss

226
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,809
the way shaper you can do a distortion
with it the funds with saying its

227
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,910
nonlinear wave shaping

228
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,029
yeah but say again this pretty hard to
understand what is if you don't actually

229
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,490
know what is

230
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,680
by could feel sir is a is a low-pass
high-pass

231
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,699
you can and Simon equalizer graphic
equalizer on it

232
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,199
basically if you want to remove the base
many concurred the base was this note

233
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,309
dynamic compressive know it the its

234
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:10,230
yeah again bit hard to explain but

235
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,809
it makes the low sound a

236
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,118
be more loud and a loud sound be more
quiet

237
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:20,550
so organizes Cup kinda I'm on ice is

238
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,878
the that would you the district thats

239
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,170
X musical invoices drums which apps

240
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,769
and then open knows once you've got your
processing and it's all nice

241
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:38,699
you can have a media stream this nation
notes so made a string is busy the

242
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,899
the object in the the modern web
platform

243
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,800
that has view or doing it and you can
consume it

244
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,939
and pipe it's too love difference if you
guys for example

245
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:53,889
you can i peep into major recorder and
get it on credit to Opus

246
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,959
or.org or mp3 or whatever you can

247
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,508
type eap by Pete into with the RTC pipe
you can papeete

248
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:05,730
into another a context though so that's
basically the way to connect

249
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,430
all the a few hours into it platform
what you this nation out that's

250
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,729
basically your speakers

251
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,790
or headphones I so you connect so if you
want some to be out that

252
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,339
then you used the you this nation out

253
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,559
screw process node you can basically
used as a

254
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,939
without outfits to gets to infer dates
on

255
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,959
do some calculation on it that can be
pretty useful sometimes

256
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,109
miss their stuff ought to do in the
nation

257
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,529
and and eyes or node basically gives you

258
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,980
the characteristic of you in for data
the may be using a transform like before

259
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,230
you transform

260
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,889
so that's also very useful to
visualization and to measure what's

261
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,179
actually going on in your way a jew
groff

262
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,029
so demos so I had and awesome demo

263
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,839
which is this one where you where it's a
2d

264
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
a to the game weather was a little guy
running

265
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,689
and whenever you guys would scream in my
microphone

266
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,720
people jump but unfortunately it's on
might

267
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,260
desk and Mozilla in Paris forgot the
code

268
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,490
some and pissed but anyway

269
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,309
so I've got this for the cord Mr s

270
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,760
sorry you have this dinner right now

271
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,829
and if you can show it like in the
corridor I have to

272
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,899
a so let's do that so weak we gonna get
to know you befor source

273
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,010
gonna sets Drum Song

274
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,020
and then we gonna do that easiest stuff
but

275
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,700
a game know it here connect this there

276
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,020
and put that there and then I will

277
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,090
best game maybe and make it

278
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,399
so it moves and play

279
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,880
I can change W me for

280
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,760
so it as you can see loops perfectly
like there is no gap in the sound

281
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,000
not been like that media MN had

282
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,120
a I can't but today a nerd

283
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,120
so I will have another copy of the sound

284
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,510
so it sounds gross but it works

285
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,120
anyway

286
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,219
and then what can I do cannot

287
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,220
controller I'm actually gonna

288
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,720
see you little reverb effects on what
kind do

289
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,490
bit by Claude sorry

290
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:01,490
an idea that and by

291
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,320
and that group

292
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,510
to see I there is no

293
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,830
high-frequency at the beginning ike is
not normal sound

294
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,250
to go to the DG effects kinda

295
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,990
that's what did you do all the time
alright

296
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,260
what can I do and personal later

297
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:42,260
sparring

298
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,670
I can

299
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,390
getting live n 9 a.m. I'm sprawling like
the the

300
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,530
engine works perfectly but they don't
call that functions it doesn't work

301
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,990
a so I'm I'm personally

302
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,150
trolling did have manually in like open
issues in

303
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,410
people's project and say all like to do
is great but doesn't mind five thoughts

304
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,180
just do this in this little book and
most of them to fix it because people

305
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,840
are nice

306
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,990
a bunch of boxes and echo exactly 926

307
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,040
last I checked some bugs to fix in with
kits blink

308
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,639
because we change the spec a a

309
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,320
and yet massive amount of stuff to fix
in the spec because

310
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,460
is fall from Dawn and we would like very
much for the

311
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,030
decent specs people can actually make
all the implementations and don't go

312
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,040
into trouble

313
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,770
like I had to retool to read a lot of
things going on was not

314
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,139
great wasn't great solar

315
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,940
possible direction was your contacts in
workers as a

316
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,790
we a here as we heard in the previews

317
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,530
a talks we want to do everything workers
so when will your

318
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,750
he will fixed owed a script process node
because

319
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,560
the it is broken perspectives written
all over the web so one repeats why

320
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,360
right now a maybe one from my sis for
all this in transportation because

321
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,139
we are more than people and we knows I
don't know contribute to the spec

322
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,150
and and to the code bright demos and
tell us tell us if it breaks

323
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,700
alright I think I'm pretty much done so
a show

324
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,110
maybe one or two questions otherwise it
will hang ups in the corner and

325
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,110
we can talk more sure where system

326
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:38,110
microphone its

327
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,029
a

328
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,519
yes I have a question

329
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,990
well you I'll yes ok I am

330
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,299
all this audio processing is amazing and
really looks cool but how will system's

331
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:55,168
response if

332
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,440
you asked to make much of them like all
the

333
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,610
filter she pulled over them the
processing I will it respond on a mobile

334
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,969
device if processing power isn't there

335
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,580
yeah soil basically you can do a lot of
stuff before it breaks

336
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,909
because it's all the Britain and a and
written up to my eyes

337
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,250
a C plus plus and SS

338
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,660
to code and neon on our if it breaks
though because it's very easy to do

339
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,840
because they could you could buy a
limited number of nodes

340
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,830
so if it breaks what you will hear is
gracious in the OU it but

341
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,040
we have we have bf's we are trying to
devise a plan

342
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,639
to a plan to automatically reduced it
needed

343
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,500
processing power without its glitching
but dots

344
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,300
like nobody does that link below that we
don't do that but we have bags open to

345
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,550
decide if a plan

346
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,860
with like it basically a first spec
partner of that says

347
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,709
alright if you're short on resources
back of this stuff first and then this

348
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,720
stuff and then mister

349
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,500
so we can actually like for example if
you do under

350
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,040
using a shot here is very expensive but
you can probably do poder you can

351
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,980
probably get away with doing better

352
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,370
using pickle power so you get you back
of

353
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,178
in quality and you will you on which
maybe we've reached like for once I can

354
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,100
so yeah adopt Dell plans to do that but
nothing is implemented yet

355
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,699
yes just letting your

356
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,630
we

357
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,050
half class is over to do that as well to
have a little

358
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,309
up yeah a little indicator

359
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:39,620
say this is this is costing you like 30
percent of the graph

360
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,280
or something so profiler sure sale

361
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:51,280
0

362
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,210
eighty I have a question from way back
yet hello

363
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,010
I i was just wondering about the choice
to include the nodes

364
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,510
with specific filtering capabilities and
so on I'm

365
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,529
as opposed to asking people to implement
JavaScript libraries to do the same

366
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,049
thing

367
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:13,080
yes i phone into my own soul so its
gonna perform a lot worse than the ones

368
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,559
in me

369
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,730
API yeah it's like what was the thought
process

370
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,640
so what happens Lafon is that there were
two suspects there was

371
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,970
a Robert gone minister in processing
spec

372
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,450
thats had absolutely no leverage just
like this by having a working condition

373
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,779
and OJ PRI how to leverage from

374
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,820
basic again delivers so that's the way
it works right

375
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,090
we have bunch going Firefox we don't use
because up

376
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,070
wait till excessive but anyway so he was

377
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,730
like before getting the heli

378
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,840
sorted out it was a coal for use cases

379
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,760
a diverse 3c people Depp told

380
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,669
p all the people the the the use cases
they wanted

381
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,750
and the I mean it was very

382
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,929
user-driven and so that's what we have
now

383
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,070
so is male so the last question on and
after a few other

384
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,760
another question sir Bowl is gonna be
outside waiting for a UN

385
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,129
on soaring to everything you want and do
you plan to support multi-channel output

386
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,770
sorry the plan to support in the RP
Madrid time allow good

387
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,320
sir on on on Mar more than stay logged
yes

388
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,279
min

389
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,809
this is not supported and downright know
it this is supported

390
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,749
on the issue have a can I revealed

391
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:41,580
of chrome on Mac OS

392
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,649
s yes six earned per size but that's the
way it is

393
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:49,718
I we have plans to do that if people ask
for it by

394
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:53,669
as visual is butts but you can mix

395
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,179
and process another teacher in a motel
inside the prof

396
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,349
dealt with us mister as the began

397
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,989
acquittal so much that meant to channel
opus file for example

398
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:07,259
usual thank you

399
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:07,959
thank you so much
