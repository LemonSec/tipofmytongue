1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,929
we're going to finish with a loss of

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,959
cypress is going to talk about this
group so I'm SSL on about it

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
and ralph is a celebrated the has also
done a lot of progress in the last year

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,740
and he's going to tell us about what has
happened

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,009
know it's Chris extolled

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,410
clarity hear me OK with this microphone
good

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,630
call are all your thanks guys for
attending our session

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,170
an a-plus on in the bed de verme the
today

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,359
and hopefully it will this today give
you an update on what we've done

10
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,960
Progress Lighting last year

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,219
and go a little bit above an overview of
our products

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,129
for those who aren't familiar with our
company or the price they offer

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,159
I my name is Chris common

14
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,829
I'm a software developer with all of us
to sell and I live in Bozeman Montana

15
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,030
and so there's a picture the valley that
bosnia's and

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,539
Andrea Watson skiing nearby so we have
for gay seasons the

17
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,780
taken their two of work their own so
I'll iron

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,230
a growing company if they are mad as a
lil bit faded there but

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,990
for a total of 10 people five full-time
and five part-time

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,220
a based and 3

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,460
three countries and six different cities
some in Bozeman Montana

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,220
we have people in Seattle Washington
parlance organ I'm how the serbs ill

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,260
back into San Jose Calif and then a guy
ever in Tokyo

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,210
I'm so that's a couple more than we had
last year

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,720
so a good sign and we estimate that we

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,370
see our main track Seattle secures over
$500 million endpoints

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,900
on the Internet dozen points the

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,490
are I really divers as it sells a very
hard all technology say anything

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,658
connecting to the internet

30
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,090
could could be a potential use case for
another seller crypto library

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm say anything or intermission
emission communication the home energy

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,400
to smart power meters et cetera

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,520
so I can mention all this I go over
brief overview our products that we

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,170
offer

35
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,339
gun what to grow at noon then although I
was in time for you guys to ask any

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,300
questions you may have

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,250
this is a product line up at all
personal cell

38
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,380
our main product is called Seattle it
the

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,540
a lightweight embeddable SSL and TLS
library

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,350
and it is backfire with crips crypto
engine

41
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,870
which the ships with it and then it also
includes a a passive SSL inspection

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,739
features of I will perhaps be there

43
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,030
photography in library size engine I we
have an embedded Web server and

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,530
embeddable web server call and yes a
little yes

45
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,790
and we came out the new practice your
call her sons and I

46
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,200
which is simply J&I rapper around
Seattle and then we have a couple

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,380
products should we don't currently have
our website yet but we have in the labs

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,709
and available to those interested so we
have a SSL proxy

49
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,769
I'm built on top the squid we have a
secure memcache implementation

50
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,769
and we also have a a skeptic
implementation so looking at our main

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,840
products see as all

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,130
I'm like I mention it's lightweight
embeddable as a cell library

53
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,530
I the whole every footprint ranges from
2200 kilobytes

54
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,220
depending on how you build it I'm the
trying to but option is aileen PSK

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,040
so a subset using link here by
appreciate case I persuade

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm anti lost 1.2 only a hundred
kilobytes will give you a pretty much of

57
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,220
a lesson szostak

58
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,320
using embedded optimize compiler I

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,380
RAM usage is is low as well 12 36
kilobytes per session

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,459
and the this is not only important so
the embedded world cares about memory

61
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,660
usage but so does the

62
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,799
enterprise and cloud services because
you're

63
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,090
you only have millions objections coming
in I your limited by

64
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,280
your rent near RAM memory and then it's
also very portable

65
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,238
so 10 our main opens our competitors is
open SSL

66
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,070
and oftentimes it's it's quite a burden
to take the whole package and ported

67
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,810
over to

68
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,370
your bed and operates the summer device
I

69
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,840
times companies are still the vote a
single engineer just a working for open

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,549
a cell

71
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,770
I'm where Seattle we've we pretty much a
part and everything we've encountered so

72
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,370
far

73
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,650
and he fears that a number that I think
the things we support

74
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,919
I'm and there I was working and

75
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,250
party ever knew months every day

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,860
of curb desire is there could I feel I
very

77
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,150
did have a process called seat out crypt
and was bundled in together with Seattle

78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,049
so they're one in the same I this year
we've been working on separating the

79
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,710
mound the two separate products

80
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,989
and so there's a lot of people who only
one crypto and not necessarily SSL

81
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,990
so very say no this bill the download to
strike at the library

82
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,590
I'm if that's your desire 3 modular so
if you only one use ASA in your project

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,650
you can just plug the source file header
file

84
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,070
and stick around your project without
having to plan everything else

85
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,210
and its very much supports all your
standard cipher suites is also

86
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,280
progressive once

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,989
I we are in the HC 128 Dravid stream
ciphers

88
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,120
and a while ago with over the end true

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,510
public key algorithm which is the
quantum resistant public key

90
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,830
from security innovation and then

91
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,280
we gotta the the bike to shot three
finalists

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,750
to intercept a day and on that

93
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,340
some things that we do every day all day
has a job I would like to give our users

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,560
the most I cutting edge technology even
possible

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,560
the other number and web server help is
built on top of Mongoose

96
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,130
which is also an open source web server
and so we take my guests and

97
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,680
but Seattle into it and now you can get
the whole entire bundle

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,039
and in the other one better web server
again very small so 100 job I it's

99
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,070
with SSL support at twenty kilobytes
without

100
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,490
if you decide the plain HTTP connection
I'm in

101
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,599
it's not surely appeal is to features as
law for being in bed web server see you

102
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,219
get CDI and as a side

103
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:41,279
and I P restrictions et cetera and also
very portable

104
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:48,110
here's what I've learned two new
products introduced this year

105
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,740
so will fetters LJ and I'm is simply and
Jan I wrap around see as well

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,000
the CL's written in C I we had a
customer who really went back to my

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,570
knees detail as 1.2

108
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,219
which the Java implementation currently
doesn't have detail a support

109
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,450
and so up until this point people have
to take as a library like a mess the

110
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,099
cell

111
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:12,250
RCL zone right there on wrap-around so
hopefully this all this provide people

112
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,479
an off-the-shelf solution

113
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,109
and then

114
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,770
I guess I'd as soon as our licensing
model a little bit are better company

115
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,289
appear that overdue licensed under the
GPL and a commercial license

116
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,539
so other products are open source I

117
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:32,719
where is Laura Barton how to MySQL they
want cleaner mess the cell

118
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,260
implementation

119
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,789
that they knew the license to make it
safely shipped with their commercial

120
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:43,469
licenses and so we rode actually a
C-plus plus SSL I recall the AZL

121
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,370
and and then eventually wrote Seattle
can be embedded market really wanna see

122
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,560
library

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm and so we follow that licensing
model now if about mostar subsequent

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,430
products

125
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,659
the second their product we've entered
is this year's the step client

126
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,719
so simple certificate enrollment
protocol

127
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,209
and so the sluts client go out and

128
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,339
n roll with us kept server and retreat
back a certificate

129
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,520
which they can then use to authenticate
to a network

130
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,719
and we stuck with our are same principle
that we've learned there are a Seattle

131
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,149
being portable and so distracted out all
the

132
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,750
most the layers that you'd encounter as
problems when you're moving over to

133
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,050
a new platform

134
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,950
amended engine uses water crept
underneath as the crypto library

135
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,620
timely under development record just
wrapping it up I'm

136
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,260
probably this week search and make it
onto our website probably in the next

137
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,260
couple weeks

138
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,729
okay let's talk a little bit now but
what's new I was done last year

139
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,509
I'm by the more interesting fired for
people who are you heard

140
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:04,769
are spiel about what we do so we

141
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,000
fix the the lucky 13 attack and

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,899
not am and Kenny came to us beforehand

143
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,920
and tell us about that and they're very
helpful and in helping us line

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,920
pushing the patch intarsia look at this
and so the like lucky 13 was a

145
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,479
timing attack so you can monitor how
much time it takes it here

146
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,180
as a sire records back and using that
eventually the crypt

147
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,060
the plaintext which is pretty amazing
actually I

148
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,250
back and yeah he getting across those
guys her

149
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,959
preparing that out I'm so we should be
protected against that

150
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,819
I'm we have had detail us apart for a
couple years now

151
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,189
so details as Danny Graham TLS so

152
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,130
it's meant to muse over unreliable
protocols such as you the PM

153
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,839
and because they can use the reliability
and out over packets

154
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,689
I stuff that TCP has it's a lot more
complex

155
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:05,160
and so we have a weirdest a couple

156
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,910
reliability enhancements sense now we
have a couple more users using an

157
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,730
I it's really popular with streaming
media

158
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm avoid et cetera and

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,399
we have ads for for details 1.2 so

160
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,430
there's the tumors in the shelter 1.0
and 1.2

161
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,138
I 1.2 just pretty much happening at to
the

162
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,350
level deal at some point if and adding
that Adad so I think it'd encryption

163
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,839
I with associated data

164
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,839
and so not only in curves but it also I
think its messages

165
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,690
we got some support for sanity let's
extensions

166
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,230
and so the server name indication Rs and
as and I

167
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,889
I'll let the client specify which
servers connecting to

168
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,700
this can be time useful and you have
multiple servers hosted

169
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,899
on the same location I'm it's overkill
for example

170
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,680
weirdest max fragment length which
allows the client to negotiate a

171
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,849
different Maximus a record size:

172
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,079
so by default SSL he is a 16 killed my
record

173
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,290
and third they're not all that big but
they can go up to that day

174
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,899
and so on it and then declined you have
to reserve 16 kilobytes

175
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,230
for the buffer and so a lot of times if
you don't have that much memory

176
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,160
which we r we encounter people every day
who it's a struggle for them to fit an

177
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,550
extra sixteen kilobytes

178
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,060
into their SSL allotment I

179
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,500
the client can use this negotiate down
the smaller Mac some fragments I S

180
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,399
and then the third on introduce first
run candidates Mac

181
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,890
the traditionally hash algorithm like
shot one is used

182
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,170
to from the Mac tag and which is easily
160 beds

183
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,120
and so is this the client can again
reserve and both

184
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,570
and track that down two at-bats I'm
currently there's not any security

185
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,329
weaknesses no on by using an at-bat iMac
answer

186
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,510
the full hash implementation for md5 and
sha-1

187
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,730
and when you configure in Seattle who is
not about system

188
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,459
by default on Linux the you can is that
enable the last

189
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,768
X option we added the

190
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:33,470
as I mentioned the shot three finalists
Blake to you answer ranges from 256 or

191
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,560
512 it

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,979
die just thanks it's actually pretty
speedy in a matter their company floss

193
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,199
me pretty well

194
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,649
%uh so not only is the lightweight but
also as fast

195
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,860
you can see here this is their seat
outstripped our wealth crypt

196
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,180
implementation benchmark

197
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,819
that's that's a national implementation
and

198
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,449
I actually on something better platforms
will be faster than md5

199
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm if they think about optimize that
correctly

200
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,180
we owned

201
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,779
I'm owed to a SCCM so counter with CBC
Mac

202
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,620
and it enabled using enable a SCCM now

203
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,360
available to users through eighth at sea
in that age and using those functions

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,990
and when used with Thiele an SSL

205
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,120
you gain a more safer streets you up
scenes between ours they see the season

206
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,910
so it's and pressure kid

207
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,910
pre-shared keys we had some discussions
with NTT who develops camilia

208
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,040
and I work with them dead camilia to our
see as a library hands both curbed

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,660
I finally the block cipher like KS

210
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,399
so against exposed through doubt the
indictment filed

211
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,560
and we give these are some new functions
work with and again you have

212
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,550
anything personally we had a

213
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,640
South 384 sober so it's RH Mac now
supports shop 512

214
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,370
and we enhance rads and I so far

215
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,250
up to supporting her optimizing for a
SCCM in GCM

216
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,769
so a yes and I as an Intel harburg sorry
crypto

217
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,680
on that I think this a five to ten times
speed improvement

218
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,920
over Saturday s as I have one
instruction with specific

219
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,120
for these Acad Sci first and I'm

220
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,120
we are to support for that I can have a
byproduct of our will scare project

221
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,089
was the additional some these PKcs 7 her
PKcs

222
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,680
PKcs standards PKcs 7

223
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,040
which is cryptographic methods intact is
used to sign and encrypt messages

224
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,099
it I is an ass and one bundle and wraps
it up kinda like an onion

225
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,490
and I'm use a landscape

226
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,519
and we also had cut your question last
couple years

227
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,510
for both these I was like going to speak
ACS tenor Certificate Signing Request

228
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,270
and the slut a clan make a CSR the
center CA

229
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,550
which then turns out into they signed
the public key contain and then send you

230
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:19,550
back an actual SSL certificate

231
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,748
a couple things portability was

232
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:28,359
we had supper for persistent session
cache so you can now process the session

233
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:28,939
cache

234
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:33,129
I dealer feiler buffer I

235
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:37,389
so here you can see in relevant
functions for vials buffers and I'm

236
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:43,609
you neighbor what they've session and
along the same lines we at the mill you

237
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,649
persist the CA certificate cash

238
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,839
i sowie undertaken files about first

239
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,480
I

240
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,549
we had a couple things that a couple
call back there that Tomic record call

241
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:00,079
back

242
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,229
for Mac encrypt operations and Egypt
where five so if you have a hardware

243
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,859
module

244
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:08,739
RA to them that can do these in one step
I

245
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:11,529
you can actually write call back and
we'll just call your eight December

246
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,730
hardware module directly

247
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,139
a worse some some users really

248
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,350
really want and sometimes can for
provide a performance

249
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,649
increase as well and then

250
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,239
along the same lines we added some
public in callbacks for our say

251
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,069
sign verify encrypt the trip and ECC cya
verify

252
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:38,069
you can download your keys and
certificates 21 them into

253
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:44,149
as is I'll context so if you need to
refresh that cash for some reason

254
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,139
and UI you I don't think the thing one
without destroying all entire context

255
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:55,139
I would see that kinda wraps up our crib
traditions

256
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,359
I moving out examples and documentation
we met our example lead

257
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,619
easier for users to get a little more
information on the

258
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:07,269
the man questions again as a buyer
resources and and so

259
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:11,049
yeah we've added the ability to track
stacking the deck memory allocation to

260
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:11,439
our

261
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,970
after examples and then also increase
the ipv6 apart

262
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,130
I since a lot more people seem to be in
experimenting with ur

263
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:29,130
are using then protection we need
another pastor API documentation

264
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,110
which is pretty good improvement over
what we had before we actually have

265
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,620
API docs for most are functions now I'm

266
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,229
well I go as documentation is continue
its work in progress

267
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:48,230
and so it will continuously improve and

268
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,350
probably eighty percent of our customers
are parting Tulare

269
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,219
operating system herb platform a
combination of TCP IP stack

270
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,399
I et cetera and so we get to questions
about parting

271
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:04,360
so we've created an early start burning
guide which covers everything from and

272
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
DNS two types

273
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,929
to assembly or possession of the library
settings

274
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm math libraries that is I all the way
down to you or call backs

275
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,059
we have call backs first sloppy and I O
if you are around as a seller something

276
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,570
the size TCPIP

277
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,668
I locking comebacks marianne and come
back six after a

278
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,889
should all be mentioned in here now one
go to you

279
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:33,889
resource arose during the new chips to

280
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:38,330
so wheels for for microchips pic32 and
Max and MZ

281
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,809
I also particular burden think 30 piece

282
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,769
TCP IP stack and I am now we work with

283
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,740
negative harmony har to their
development environment that just was

284
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,429
released

285
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:56,169
this year I wore purple actually shipped
with harmony by default so if that's

286
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,309
easy download harmony

287
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,730
your water to be in there and if you
want Seattle

288
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,000
ill you can download it and it should
work seamlessly I'm into may be in there

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,250
and

290
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:12,220
in the future we've added support for
some Freescale stuff so there's some

291
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,389
other hardware based around number
generators

292
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,590
are in GA an Argentine be I

293
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,658
are now easily any old by a simple the
fine

294
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,059
and we just as the for for the MCA you

295
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,730
which is there their hardware optimized
script operations

296
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,750
and and I think the next slide all

297
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,559
yes I here's a a comparison between our
software seat after

298
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,710
implementation and the Freescale Canada
NCAA you

299
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,220
you through the thin you are from a 20
percent to thirteen hundred percent

300
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,929
increase

301
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:49,990
in speed if the same thing

302
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,010
I'm autograph the on the bench its like
again if the

303
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:02,010
move awesome for users we as for for
cabin night rocks which is another

304
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,658
I'm Mormon enterprise are dropping into
the harbor up my skirt the solution

305
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm right now we do boxing crypto

306
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,350
which most soccer delivers do hopefully
sometime in the next year

307
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,709
or so will bill that non locking her up
to which sold really really increase the

308
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,649
performance numbers are coming nine
trucks parked a

309
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:29,590
we on for for HPUX are praying for them
and better thread X afford

310
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,059
as well as default I I'll come back for
net X

311
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,070
so out of the box if you're using

312
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,600
other surtax on net X we should work

313
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,809
we permit to the stm32 chips I

314
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,119
as well as integrated into their hard
work ripped a and

315
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,168
random number generator I'm here you see
our speed performance comparison again

316
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,690
between oranges are stopped for
implementation and green

317
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,889
is our in the less than 32

318
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,100
trip to 30th

319
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,760
substantial improvement for users

320
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,139
we've been working pretty closely with
Kyle this last year

321
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:16,850
I went for dinner and decay arm I as
well as integrated into the indicate

322
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,309
fire

323
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,369
development environment and we're
actually ass off her back now

324
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:24,750
30 gotta to Kyles one side you can
download

325
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,820
what s alright and ball right and threw
the the Kyle tools

326
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,029
so you don't have to come to our website
and download any more

327
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,360
on which we think is pretty cool and
unique are pretty they're enjoying it so

328
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,750
far

329
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,779
no guns to get him back

330
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:45,679
so it's come all the technical me as Sir
the high littlest I'm a couple

331
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,279
items the business news you may remember
a so the AZL

332
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,379
which we were last year and last time
you saw sprightly

333
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,850
we've changed our name to water so sell
and we just think a better alliance with

334
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,340
our company values and culture

335
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,459
and laws idly communicate effectively

336
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,570
they they work well and curbs

337
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:14,570
and they share mine here kinda like open
source developers

338
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,950
we had a couple more developers the team
so we can get things done all that

339
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,450
faster

340
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,529
I we increased our on-site consulting
activity

341
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,510
and we a launcher movie Cars Pixar
consulting program

342
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,570
somebody can send us our their entire
platform

343
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:36,570
local perhaps offer Everton centre-back
term

344
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm a big 12 always in the United States
a big item news's steps 13-2 validation

345
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,590
for all script I so this is a

346
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,908
a crypto module validation that allow
government

347
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:54,850
I'm and some businesses look for in
encrypt a model they point to their code

348
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,980
and so it's a pretty long process to go
through its you know anywhere from six

349
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,350
to 12 months

350
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,678
and puzzling on time for allowed to
verify things

351
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,129
and so hopefully we'll get this wrapped
up in in the next happen

352
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:10,199
well for the next Carter if ur lucky

353
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,289
I'm with that will bring a once in the
documentation the CL's almost crapped

354
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:20,789
will bring all this new tests and and
smaller thanks

355
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:24,309
we've tried to streamline our support
process a little bit better and as I

356
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,200
growth

357
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,960
using this to a direct email got a
little overwhelming

358
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,850
so so sorry love then the score giving
out right so now you'll you'll be issued

359
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,059
a support ticket

360
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,330
when you know us and hopefully work a
little better

361
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,779
I'm we treasure try to keep customers
highest priority

362
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:45,649
has risen users

363
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:49,699
so i think thats that's very much a my
updated what we've done this year

364
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,820
I but to answering questions yourself

365
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,340
but of a seller related technologies

366
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,080
johnnie partly based in the US most

367
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,789
Bo's redone actually confident decision
on the house

368
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,158
an essay programmers had pretty mild

369
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,299
loves a legitimate question and we can
probably say we are not compromised by

370
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,799
the NSA

371
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,309
heck um

372
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,330
we actually we keep an eye on
contributions are a closely

373
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,340
and archivists and so I think governor
still have some

374
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,830
some questionable things that were
slowed down but we definitely have

375
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,168
for developers let me know what they're
doing all the time and

376
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:40,349
own company tell you that we have been
compromised

377
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:44,020
the

378
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,139
provided all

379
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,570
I G a simple 1

380
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,240
I probed

381
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,710
I'm yeah you should be able to do
anything I regarding like

382
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,090
easing up src as of: they should be
pretty much trouble a-minus

383
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,459
Paul as a zealous I guess I'm not sure I
mean

384
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,800
yeah example %uh yes and one like this

385
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,600
the last that was it read they have a
little KS

386
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,649
she is it would CEO okay Google

387
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,780
so

388
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,740
so ass I

389
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,639
so I okay

390
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:36,468
yeah isn't they did do a little bit
different they have a IBIO

391
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:40,149
I'm method input/output I

392
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:45,209
and so we offer certificate management
we offer users the ability a tray

393
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,210
certificates

394
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,089
um Mol Cell signed and now with our CSI
CSI and

395
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,839
what I'm with basic create brokers ms

396
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,870
it with you makes from the

397
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:05,620
okay seemingly aka it could mean another
we have PKcs 7 suffered a tat there's a

398
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,649
chance that in mind

399
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,510
yeah look at answers a question

400
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:17,210

sticker

403
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,330
have other ASM thanks for attending

404
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,310
