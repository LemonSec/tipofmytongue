1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,180
particular afternoon or

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,609
very close to the

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,070
you will try to talk whitcomb

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,770
key and hello everybody exit
introduction am

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,350
barred from flexor and I am

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,619
sort of looks about I think it 2007 the
end of 2007

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,390
best to speak up the applicant so I
started to flex in 2007

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,899
it went through several the rations a
and by now it's a

9
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,730
and it's a ceasar two fights device

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,930
which already mentioned in the
introduction

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,800
can monitoring your electricity
consumption gas water

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,000
to trim and and then

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,539
yep this is Sam going off on tangents

14
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,079
unsealed the what those we can do with
that with the flexo a

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,500
for another would like to introduce the
flexo cue it's something I've been

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,230
working on

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,798
it's very experimental sweet so it's
only like a month

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,900
alt a.m. it's this

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,920
kind of thing a.m. think it should
sticks

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,890
sticks to middle layup a.m.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,450
and so for a close-up this is a flex a
cube

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm it's an experiment a.m. in

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,250
trying will what you seen in most the
most notes

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,159
is that the especially in open source
predictor

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,549
microcontroller and your enormous a
trough with me

26
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,060
re at the chin a radio to its and Andrea
the basic Bartz

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,950
and there are some ports a to which you
can hook up different sensors

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,250
I'm which is greats a

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,409
accept that if you want to put this in
your living room in its full of wires

30
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,630
it's a throw-in

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,869
and dis wants bolster

32
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,040
wife except inspectors so I'm

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,360
that's one thing and the secondly a both
the chances are that it's not going to

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,829
last very long because a

35
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,989
water gets pulled out at around so I
will too

36
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,900
in this experiment a little to start
seeing okay so how can this team look

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,080
how to make its fully open source how we
can make

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
the enclosure treaty printable and the

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,579
this is the first let's iteration so
this really version 1

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,900
and includes a sprint it's at the for
popular than

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,920
on Friday sewer just aren't enough time
to

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,309
cool down and prisons over here

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,780
so if you open its it's actually to
ports

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,780
and just a game going try to coordinate
this

45
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,589
so there's a doesn't make that as you
can see there

46
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,660
there's a ring magnets neodymium magnets
in the back

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,349
rich does to function so you can hook it
up to anything that's middle

48
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,519
a and secondly a.m. does about 3

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,690
at the back over here so it's a fats the
lithium

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,040
a quintal battery one thousand million
powers

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,489
a.m. which also responses also
magnetically

52
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,730
sponsored magnets so that means that if
you if your position

53
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,970
to overhear it gets snapback and it will
read in there so if you ever put it in

54
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,510
their back

55
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,239
you're the top site done it went on to
release a.m.

56
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,370
offered up the a little hole in the back
so we can push it out them

57
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,790
but this means that you'll you can you
can just mounted anywhere in your

58
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,500
your living room to throw and it will it
will stay put

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,690
and now for the note itself perhaps it's

60
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,060
for supporting closure and the enclosure
was designed in there

61
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,769
open scouts which is a great tool for

62
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,500
making these kinds of things so it's
it's basically programming

63
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,700
a.m. you program your enclosure and you
can also

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,630
make all kinds of for averting you can
you can make it a parameter so you can

65
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,010
see

66
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,890
you for example the update to build its
a bit small but you can see the magnet

67
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,730
by mentions and I have to have this kind
of the lawrence et cetera

68
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,010
a.m. you can see the file is just a a
bit longer so it's like

69
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,200
a page in the HOF and if your end ritz
you gets

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,300
you get this inclusion and then if you
press the bring bottom

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,330
you can actually treaty print that's who

72
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm not something I would like to do a
small chuckle not only

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,340
make sensor node also health have to
stay in your

74
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,130
evil for its its code so if somebody
wants to take it and see a cake to make

75
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,240
this a lot of answer

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,700
feel free to do so and I haven't put it
up on

77
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,289
on get up yet it will be soon so this is
a still very fresh

78
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,590
chin a.m.

79
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:00,590
than a bit about the internal so so if
you take the top borzoi

80
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,700
one of its function says as a as DA at
the external part so

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,409
should look at it this way so on the
outsides

82
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,560
a.m. the reinvent amounts the

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,400
their sons or so for movement fiction
and an ambient light some sort so they

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,479
have to be on the outside

85
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,560
the generals we can just keep them on
the inside so

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,050
doesn't dampen humidity sensor pressure
sensor

87
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,960
and for now also in an accelerometer
which is a lot of

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,460
char love from census what you can do a
interesting thing Missy

89
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,530
things with a.m. for a microcontroller
so the friction between totally

90
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,979
has been using a if you're for a while
but to well

91
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,520
has been a couple shearson and now we
have all the sexy a

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,280
cortex and syriza stuff the 1i

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm under the heroes in is no PC device
is been up for

94
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,060
think of your your something a.m. the
great fun thing about this is that

95
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,460
them it internally comes with a switch

96
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,770
which means that you can search all to
cross bore:

97
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,740
so you can assign functions UART SBI I
script c2

98
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,890
any kind of bins a what I'm doing is

99
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,010
left the right exposing the Swayze older
the strange the exact

100
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,900
traces exposing all those bins so if you
make adult reports

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,799
you can just in so for and make certain
connections

102
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
by softer in in the crossbar internally
in the in the microcontroller

103
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,490
and you can sign well them almost
reassigned anything from GPA which wears

104
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,800
ice gritty to you or to secure their
core or Core for

105
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,190
of course am 6 pins for example for the

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,610
for the oscillator et cetera so you gone
to move those arounds

107
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,719
22 anything but muscle tomorrow are
really

108
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,409
available must answer also I squirt
cedras

109
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,930
actually just a bus in just a couple
everything my scripts

110
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,310
so

111
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,169
a.m. also want to have some a good bits
of the budding

112
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,530
so what time it is a third Bartz so the
second which is actually

113
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,849
the review internally an old picture the
battery

114
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,469
and wynton and any of the third-party

115
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,550
which is actually a debug imports and

116
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,699
if I get to write a terse which are
still in the meal a

117
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,770
you can just put me in between the two
aborts like sandwich a.m.

118
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,840
and a you can do introspection with
aborting to your microcontroller

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,780
first of all you can do is be so you can
program it you can also victories

120
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,409
like trees from from your a from
replication

121
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,370
and it's also got a a GA Tech an issue
where out the 2.0-litre deeper cuts

122
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,160
which comes standard on all them cortex

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm serious chips rich miss you can do
some

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,819
very nice debugging setting breakpoints

125
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,530
Sutra and event this the Jets so that
the former afloat works

126
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,388
and but the GITEX less to be too
supports

127
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,380
I don't expect too many difficult the
could differ disorder

128
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,590
so that's thats them back to the Flex
meter

129
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,310
so this is the latest version it states
to be version and it's it's got actually

130
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,150
a new

131
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,440
use in sports with the Raju that is
compatible

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,819
with the one on the sun's report so we
can actually have some communication

133
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,880
between the two

134
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,500
and hence the title the to talk so we
can

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,410
actually have this much meter sites
having its measure

136
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,919
electricity gas and water consumption
also have its as a as a as a hope

137
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,549
a telemetry hope for these kinds of
notes

138
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,120
a.m. the reticle it has been supported
up until now

139
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,578
just in the driver so there's no
application level stuff on it

140
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:44,660
but it's a it's urgent notes a
compatible richer

141
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,040
some few mites them the familiar with

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,599
and and that isn't done it's it's
intended to say that we have school

143
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,160
so does the forks major a.m. so besides
doing

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,900
this hardcore stuff there's a but also
for still to be written

145
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,760
riches something i'm told you working on
so basically what I would like to start

146
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,170
if you have such as sensor nodes

147
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,469
you have parent which means that you can
put the flights between pairing mode and

148
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,199
start listening or special or a
particular channel

149
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:16,609
and if you just restart your

150
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,130
your YouTube it will going to be removed
and it'll do all the provisioning

151
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,459
all the sensors that are on your you and
just provision does

152
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,229
we need to have for so that this is a
relegated to the kids bootloader

153
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,390
insights that the cortex

154
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,650
rinse aid to cuba and then you have for
support for of year for upgrades

155
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,120
a.m. we don't have to South scripted

156
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,959
packets but the we want to have a chess
informant that describes what's actually

157
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,760
being cents by specific and sensor nodes

158
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,400
and once we have that we can make a
jubilant that can do

159
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,470
automatically degrading including based
on that

160
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,449
purchasing formative and

161
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,740
and and just want to have a to Internet
of Things style

162
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,020
a were already or intend to publish its
own

163
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,939
on them but it's and QT brokerages the
just be present in the loss to

164
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,240
for a bridge for for affects me too so
that's already in there it's a mosquito

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,910
and which is an amputee broker

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,219
which is going to standardization
process

167
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,870
right now inside power with I'm not
mistaken city could serve foundation

168
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,839
am so that's a how the F alone could
work as in

169
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,370
as a telemetry and and is summer

170
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,089
do it in action so I just took it to my
fridge a.m.

171
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,819
so this would be nice accept them a bit
worried that my kids will take this and

172
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:45,260
start playing with it

173
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,870
so that's a that's going to be too hola
the more per person

174
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,900
then again I kept fully to like a like
it doesn't it

175
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,510
go on and on the fridge and just hope
that the winter at least people love

176
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,790
them

177
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,980
or don't touch at least 10 them but them
so that's a bitter

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,380
the ideal thereof the cuban so it's very
much still

179
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,490
work in progress a.m. this is a really
busy can

180
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,240
and also version but I hope it'll to
live auction

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,540
into to something nice so

182
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,610
yeah so if you feel feel free to roam to
participate it's got rations

183
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,860
well you know where to find me and

184
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,480
I'll be boosting this the current firmer
and the

185
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,510
Scott software ordered at scotts
description

186
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,240
of of the inclosure will be posts to
YouTube

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,640
to YouTube repository very very soon
expect this week or next week

188
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,640
the people's thats

189
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,829
questions

190
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,540
do you have any idea what a rough
estimate on the lifetimes

191
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,899
note from the bathrooms but Sally

192
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,759
and not yets but that should be

193
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,350
plus one year and that that's should be
a conservative arent

194
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,589
conservative estimates it all depends of
course

195
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,589
it's not really the sensors that will do
a lot of further battery consumption but

196
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,610
actually to rate you

197
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,300
so if you see a key I want to have
updates every 10 seconds then they want

198
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,219
loss for years

199
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,750
to see if the five minutes which is a
key for for a temperature reading

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,240
reports reading it's a true

201
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,480
a.m. the you should at least get one
year

202
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,579
that starts TM at least them and

203
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,019
so we'll see the console hope hope you
took to write this off for

204
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,889
it also means that you have to do a lot
for will not a lot but you have to start

205
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,279
out

206
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,620
with an architecture that stirred thus
world that but sturdy my control into a

207
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,680
deep sleep modes

208
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,040
by default and only we could up so that
that something has been taking care of

209
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,589
already

210
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:58,220
it has to be valid of course into the
into the design

211
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,370
so most of the census or the the
relevant ones that need

212
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,170
that need to be able to break up the
microcontroller like the best

213
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,490
movement detection Dre already hooked up
to the 1 p.m. that can

214
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,120
dig it out of a deep sleep mode and if
you put this cortex into a deep sleep

215
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,740
mode to you

216
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,019
you get about like the one my crew and
people's consumption

217
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm so it's you won't be the that the
arm that that's going to consumption

218
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,910
but we'll see and the radios also 0.1

219
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,500
my ground because you put it in to sleep
of course if you make it up a star

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,360
transmitting its

221
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,310
it's like 20 millions and that's also
the reason one of the reasons the

222
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,910
user that the did you know it's tough
because it's

223
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,630
them will the protocol is really very
tiny

224
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,759
if you go into the starting offensive
for low-power stuff

225
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,220
every bits that you since is costing you
dearly

226
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,149
so every bit but you can spare and not
censuses

227
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,699
is give you a battery life so that's a
and you do make trade-offs of course a

228
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,609
and the maximum packet size would be
about 64 bytes

229
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,839
at Henry's only three bites you put a
bit of preamble their sweet release a

230
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,910
new couple bites

231
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,880
every for every packet that you're
something but it remains to be seen

232
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,880
before we can Oregon tickets

233
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,309
which may be tell us a bit about the
video

234
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:28,230
what kind of secrecy as usual thanks for
the call and also does it integrate with

235
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,610
other

236
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,689
home ok mating season like extend or
other particles

237
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:35,849
will the real you will be in a an evil
fortune order

238
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,019
of the one that said the news but you
know it's so they are open till

239
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,759
the which is pretty popular in in her
circles

240
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,199
a.m. so it's pretty low cost I it's a
it's on its exit

241
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,819
its frequency shifting with the new

242
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:54,490
version of that radio you can do some
the whitening

243
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,619
and stuff like that or caution a ski

244
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,769
but will probably be just put it in the
first key and

245
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:05,019
with inasmuch compatibility serve it
with the printer

246
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,720
G note configuration so I'm not not too
much a fancy stuff in there

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,249
a.m. but it gets the job done which is
OK

248
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:17,059
and an A for compatibility old

249
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,480
you have a plethora of a standards is
dis UFC

250
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,480
be on the issue is and stuff like that
so a.m.

251
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,790
what I also like about about the chips
or visit its fully

252
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,219
open you don't have to go to a special
interest group a sign an NDA

253
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,809
blah blah blah before he gets before you
get the spec so it's fully open your

254
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,809
right a wrong driver

255
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,139
and units justice bi-partisanship put it
in this mode and I'll send it out in

256
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:39,579
this way

257
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,549
which I find great so if you want to
make an open device as a way to do it

258
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:48,160
a.m. compatibility will you can always
once you have it in a beauty

259
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,670
you can just a and it will be in

260
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,819
just want to prevent you to do this you
can parse it to your liking

261
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:59,719
and is free one day maker make a version
of this or you can do

262
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,579
control dan is just in MQT to someone
special

263
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:08,160
on certain property simply put this on
purpose of and everything else is softer

264
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,949
which you want to get up to 2x turn to
something else than you have to put in a

265
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:12,670
bridge for

266
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,670
it's pure soft

267
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,629
my question was because you advertise it
as a tool for measuring

268
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,550
water gas and electricity consumption I
don't see how the census can

269
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,550
measure water gas and electricity
consumption so this one already measures

270
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:47,430
dislike that this is a Dutch smart meter
so you can also already look it up

271
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,279
directly to the smart meter and it will
decode stir

272
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,680
did you 1 port to the smart meter there
also

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,508
on the other parts on the top their
loans grew thermal you can connect

274
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:57,389
current clamps

275
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:02,019
you can connect with contacts the there
are some more sensors in in the pipeline

276
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,439
likable reflective sensor that's almost
finished and so

277
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,510
with approximately already do that now
the question is how can you extend its

278
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,199
so if you want to measure temperature
Akhil dislikes meters muscle to time

279
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,179
sitting in the basement so you can't
measure temperature if your basement or

280
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,429
run a very long wire

281
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,459
but if you can just extend its so if you
see here does a radio model over there

282
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:26,390
read a model with an internal and on if
you have this QP put it in your living

283
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,610
room done is done just

284
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,580
talk to the to the Flex major and this
one can already

285
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,158
just connect its make these readings
available and

286
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:39,500
and if you go to the Internet that's a
whole chain

287
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,179
is there a

288
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,380
plan for other sensabaugh it's like if
you want to

289
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,870
connect external sensors like to put
them in of Richardson

290
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,969
what you mean putting in your fridge

291
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,179
if you want the internal

292
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,289
temperature and I'm sure if you want to
really stick the whole cuban

293
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,919
fridge would be a nice experiments

294
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,649
would be a solution to my tits tampering
with the

295
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:15,500
with the setup but term weights a so
this is sexual juiciest version 1

296
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,000
a.m. version the or newest revision 1

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,809
revision tool already have some holes
your for extending the

298
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,889
the ice for Tebow's so for a for a

299
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,020
having a better act abilities you can
leave it open the means that it will

300
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,539
have some

301
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,169
open holes for the temperature sensor
but you can also closed and have an

302
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:33,780
external

303
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,260
as gritty something so the rain should
be limits

304
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,919
so it's up to me to two meters perhaps
the bestest and if you perhaps lower to

305
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,659
the portraits LDDS Chrissy bus but its

306
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,159
that's when we were you could use the
extents the the Jupiter a.m.

307
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,559
if you want lets even different sensors
a.m. there's always supports array2

308
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,418
open dissent wish and put put in a
report in between and and you can

309
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,929
extended to even more it's a pic
yesterday but the basic idea is to Kate

310
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,080
deepest you pay already have the 556
answers for free

311
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,340
you don't have to start extending the
Wharton you have a small

312
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,600
small world some some notes but if you
want all the sensors and you get a boat

313
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,100
like this and then you have to think

314
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,149
d how I'm going to put this in an
enclosure a you don't know and look at

315
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,010
them then it's just

316
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,260
over der Goldring dust so this would be
done

317
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,309
well be perhaps not

318
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:32,070
to this have a question about

319
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,450
to distance because what we talkin its

320
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,580
inside home apartment soho

321
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,908
for you can please such sensors and you
also mention

322
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,280
from Europe di stories it's Pete and
reliability

323
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:53,280
of so

324
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,120
judges regional will be enough low for

325
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,620
doing did a few for a

326
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,750
so it's reliable and speed is enough to
do it fast

327
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,960
not they come for the sodium

328
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,230
the arm chip is a

329
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,809
limited on mistaking 216 kilobytes for
for firmer

330
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,049
so even if you lose a user pretty slow

331
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,658
a connection like a the BCG note one is
so it's about fifty

332
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,740
be per second a at full rates

333
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,370
but I you have to earth packet
processing it's a true story never going

334
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,270
to it that's rated

335
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,840
a.m. the rain she's one of the reasons
to be

336
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,428
we opt for the its exit and we still
have the 2.4 because that's a

337
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:46,130
that's terrible for your attenuation and
so the its exit cities in trouble a

338
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,580
couple

339
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,289
triple false and still still have
reasonable range everything depends of

340
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,289
course on your radio

341
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:55,450
so what you're a which are lean budget
is so how powerful can you transmit

342
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,889
and what's your your your your noise
floor a

343
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,719
but is new or chips they can go up to
13d be a month transmit power

344
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,630
and there to receive a death threat even
not mistaking is

345
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,860
minus one of life's rough you have a
bottling budget the 415 DBM

346
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,289
which should be ok give for at least
going to the full house

347
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,780
will depends on your house of course if
you have a council that's different

348
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,139
for my house it would be okay since the

349
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:27,379
so you're full would defer defer amor a
bit since 3am

350
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,399
a.m. what we're building is so

351
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:33,530
and something robust

352
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,110
so basically a.m. the Jeep the

353
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,049
the coupon asks the Flex me to do after
a great during boot

354
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,070
and it says yes number to this firmer
its its ok to cuba to collect all the

355
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,820
packets

356
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,370
just packets get lost it will just read
right until it gets a little firmer

357
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,418
if it's if it's Phils to try it again so
that's in the bootloader dance that

358
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:56,919
Oscar the bootloader

359
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,260
to get it working in a.m.

360
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,030
the it will try or it will go that
feeling

361
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,280
so if you go from the Brits and you
borrow the Flex me there for the next yr

362
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,350
for next of the area but we will be
there too because to try

363
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,860
its job better with the new firmer does
an exponential backoff in there but

364
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,240
them its side one or the other so it

365
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,780
arm is it open the purity ring on the
brew grew bored

366
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,610
but you should

367
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,168
yet this this one is can you can you
specify with

368
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,919
system-on-chip you use and how do you
interface the

369
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,049
your report was a pupil is it you aren't
or something else

370
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,899
so this is new to open the BRT every
fortunate has been

371
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,600
reproduction also version and production
has always been open to the RT

372
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,870
from I I determine the migration to

373
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,610
attitude adjustments in the second half
of last year's that that's for rent

374
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,199
opened in October

375
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,280
a.m. the connection with the with the
sensible to suffice by

376
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,480
so it's Bibi East a.m. that is big bank
this PI

377
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,929
but that's enough because you don't have
that much communication between the two

378
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:12,490
so

379
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,559
love processing has been going on since
reports for a glance it over samplings

380
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,600
at six under torture something per and
risks on that the 626

381
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,059
the brutal a.m. and then if you go to
trees is to kill hurts

382
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,120
but that sold locally only if you are
and what you get back every second is a

383
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,789
reading

384
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:33,299
a real time consumption and a counter

385
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,799
so that sits by communication between
the since Burton meanwhile and its open

386
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,710
wrt

387
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,710
nagy and on on the board

388
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,320
okay two quick questions is there any
sort to encryption

389
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,730
between the cube device and flex meter

390
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,059
and second is there live is there a way
to send the common

391
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:03,059
to the books always lose your it is just
know that sends

392
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,949
so for the encryption part by default
right now we will def

393
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,200
encryption butter in the bootloader will
already be the facilities to

394
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,700
downloads 16 bytes a key

395
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,899
them so they left like it limits back
Victor if

396
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,809
it's in in Lynn and well in plain

397
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:26,250
you create your own you put your arm
comment your keys sent over to over the

398
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,059
over the air

399
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,389
so that's a limited X Factor but once
it's in there it'll calculates

400
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,629
a.m. a CRC or or hash

401
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:37,309
of the thing and wanted to connect again
to see a key I have this hash

402
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,379
of the key so it won't retransmit the
key back to the pipe to the Flex meter

403
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,340
to check it

404
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,780
so that's only one suggest to go there
and then it's already the facilities

405
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,070
already in the bootloader

406
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,240
but its the the chip itself ordered a
review

407
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,559
a.m. will by default right now not be
improved

408
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,149
and and in the seconds rituals I have
read duration:

409
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:02,010
I'm so the thing about the tradition is
that if you have to

410
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,379
the if you want to have it very reactive
you have to keep on your review

411
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:11,340
which is of course a a drain on the
battery a.m. there are some

412
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,580
the some intelligent ways of handling
this

413
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,490
does by using a between your your radio
to sleep in on listening every

414
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,010
every couple of seconds for every minute
but then you for that yes def

415
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,000
with synchronization but this is
something that that can be done

416
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,139
let's refer to start to just start with
the sensor nodes a thats

417
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,379
well senses all kinds of things and and
publicity and

418
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:39,100
and especially just get this the the
lifetime

419
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,760
order the battery life I get as high as
possible

420
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,320
and in the second Face recon weekend
look for a

421
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,168
for actuation

422
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:57,169
thank you

423
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,799
so some I think adjusting for the

424
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,260
further a decision that TUF a 230

425
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,908
arm positioned 230 we do have like the

426
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:14,139
participant in discussions so I think if
they are

427
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,520
more people into interested into

428
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,200
through some either I think it to thirty
you

429
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,830
between 2:30 and 4:30
