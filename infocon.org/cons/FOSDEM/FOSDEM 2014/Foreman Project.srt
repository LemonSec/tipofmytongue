1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
but

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,760
K

3
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,390
hello everyone

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,390
lol

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,429
welcome alright

6
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,749
ok with us closer

7
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:48,749
okay

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,899
hours okay welcome everyone

9
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,179
I today like to talk

10
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,620
we view on that about about just about
forty minutes it's all about four min

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,289
and its relevance still infrastructure
and virtualization

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,110
I also just for me to know how many are
using or no

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,470
foreman here wonderful

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,570
I can go out now thing okay Corp

15
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,889
so its new set of lights are hopefully
it's not boring for for everyone

16
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,850
including myself

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,059
to do repeat and

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,409
on I meaning maybe I'll fail with the
new flight so bear

19
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,240
me alright so for so are we talking
about in terms of nominal do a very

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,750
quick introduction up

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,799
what form is about so we on the same
page a

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,990
no money we're talking about life cycle
observers a

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,458
where based ever start somewhere well

24
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,590
when they're initially positioned set up
all the way to whatever needs to happen

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,530
to make them

26
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,549
production-ready up to the point where
they

27
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,070
eventually stop could be very short
could be very long period depends on

28
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,419
your

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,420
use cases I we specifically

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,259
talk about in very a focusing on
integration with configuration

31
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,109
management provisioning services

32
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,669
and monitoring the infrastructure we
actually supposed to be

33
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,828
is it suppose isn't running and
configure the way it's supposed to be

34
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:15,260
so when we talk about provisioning I
think paula has a

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,640
a the unique point of view in terms of
allowing you to go all the way from

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,500
bare-metal

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,070
I all the way to virtualization and
cloud

38
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,578
we pretty much the same process so if we
think about

39
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:32,650
large organization usually sadly there's
not not only a single system

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,940
this may be very mental and beer or
maybe cloud and or hybrid cloud multiple

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,459
data centers will triple combination of
things and when the complexity goes

42
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,690
a higher and higher at the end of the
day the people who actually launch those

43
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,220
stuff

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,630
could be API but could also be operators

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,100
and we want to simplify the process for
them so it's pretty much the same

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,680
process

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,170
whether you deploy on bare metal or
employees OpenStack and so on

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,518
I'm in terms of configuration

49
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,090
I am I I miss you most if you're well
aware that

50
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,940
about today mostly most configuration on
American thing

51
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,739
career configuration is done with some
sort of a framework whether it's proper

52
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,220
chat fanciful Sol

53
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,440
see if engine and brother and so on so
the idea is

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,980
a not simply to try and gap does I

55
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,159
bridge those gaps re: between the
provisioning process

56
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,298
the setup process and the reporting
process

57
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,390
all into unified framework and when we
talk about

58
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,220
a my toe ring is basically making sure
it's not a nag yes typical type

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,000
monitoring

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,830
but actually making sure that the policy
that you've set your configuration

61
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,849
management policy that you've said
actually I

62
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,899
is done correcting are not correctly and
then you could get

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,909
all kind of information about what's
going on also inventory for systems and

64
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,349
and and ability to use

65
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,939
scan in search and get information a

66
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,950
in a nutshell former and architecture a

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,950
has basically four major components

68
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,958
we are forming itself which is a Ruby on
Rails application

69
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,150
we have smart proxies we have their
consideration

70
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,320
integration management the compute
resources and obviously the UI APIC line

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,358
all those elements so when we talk about
smart proxy is basically a

72
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,070
a mechanism allow for men to reach out
if we've think about

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,969
large-scale organization that problem
has lots of data centers lots of

74
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:29,680
networks

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,020
lots of different network types network
segments

76
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,270
proxies kinda a gateway that

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,370
woman can reach out and manage remote
services running on remote data centers

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,099
are isolated networks

79
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:47,690
whether it's things like I maybe I know
your DNS or maybe just BMC and manage or

80
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,700
IIPM I bare metal servers

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,020
this mark Fox itself because we're
trying to

82
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,950
can imagine that makes a match a lot of
things a smart box itself can actually

83
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,140
run on Windows for example obviously run
Linux and talks to

84
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,909
standard DNS services but can also run
on Windows if you're an enterprise and

85
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:08,349
you have

86
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,279
some you know Active Directory things
like that so we went we try to integrate

87
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,250
and expose the REST API across all of
those services so it's kind of a

88
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,370
one REST API for example to add DNS and
the name

89
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,680
many providers a in the back and whether
it's Active Directory bind

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,979
and so on I the configuration management

91
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,839
so we have a very deep integration the
moment with puppet when it comes to

92
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,800
things and and shift now starting as
well but things like

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,700
knowing what's going on known weeks
reports what actually happened on your

94
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,339
system

95
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,039
which inventory do you have and
obviously what is the role and

96
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,649
what which what the system is doing it's
not enough just to

97
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,490
just enough to last the Jews we want to
know exactly what's

98
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,729
a is install on that system what its
purpose maybe

99
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,089
me even more important there's multiple
environment support staging production

100
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,580
other multiple versions of a production
and so on

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,930
and integration ball that making it
kinda seem less

102
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,930
as much as possible to the user

103
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,180
um when we talk about compute resources
this is the way for men

104
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,210
basically reach out to remote systems
whether it's the

105
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,750
over there OpenStack being where

106
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,780
ec2 Leeper directly and so on

107
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,250
mobile computers on Rackspace a and
allow

108
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,870
basically obstruct the process of what
is involved what

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,450
what's required to actually make a
change in obstructed into single

110
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,539
I'll process regardless of the provider

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,900
I'm so we use

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,870
alive recall fog I am wouldn't

113
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,840
in Ruby based very popular library which
we

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,049
happily contribute in use then we have
another abstraction

115
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,130
which we call computer profiles which
allows us to let's say define our own

116
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,230
sets up the fall for example we could
think about the traditional small medium

117
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,650
large

118
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,239
and then define what is small medium
large and every different provider

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,900
a and also for different a set of
customers

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,810
so we can use we don't identify for
example OpenStack is

121
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,760
OpenStack obviously its attendant in
OpenStack that's a given user in

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,469
OpenStack

123
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,780
thing goes for ec2 and so on and we can
define different sets different people

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,859
which one of them so later on we we'll
be talking about the high-level object

125
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,200
for example I want to deploy

126
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,539
a small webster and and that the
position of

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,770
I'll a web server or your Apple whatever
it is

128
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,979
is something we call host code which is
basically the system defined that

129
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,770
definition

130
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,219
of your system a so it's

131
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,570
it's a it's a way to say this is the
default operating system i want for my

132
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,159
web services the fall

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,490
a puppet relationship marcia

134
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,250
recipes and obviously associated with
the computer profiles

135
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,830
now why I'm telling you that because the
idea is that you can define a high level

136
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,140
of dicks such as a

137
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,659
web server and have the ability for for
men to spin up a VM create an image for

138
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,980
it

139
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,170
on every different provider
automatically so

140
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,420
I have all the information I need up
Braun to define the system regardless

141
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,040
of where it's gonna run I can define to
the web server

142
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,360
I have all the recipes all the
ingredients to make it happen on

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
different flowers and then I don't need

144
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,280
I can easily transform revealed the same
system

145
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,740
on a different cloud if I would like we
can also do

146
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,890
interesting more interesting things for
example detected

147
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,530
some sort of a drift if there was an a
package update

148
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,030
that we can detect from let's say a
public report and that claims that it

149
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,459
took

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,390
a make more than a minute maybe it makes
sense for us to spin a VM making it

151
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,400
snapshot that make an image outta that
and automatically

152
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,470
next time system puts up it will consume
the latest image so there's a lot of a

153
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,610
a nice things we can do abstract that
and I don't know how if you ever use the

154
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,130
traditional image building tools

155
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,730
but this approach actually I uses the
store the storage

156
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,320
out of the you know and provide I'm not
building a

157
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,300
image on my laptop and uploading it to
ec2 for example

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm actually building it NEC to in the
first place I

159
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,609
when we talk about provisioning we talk
about basically everything we can to

160
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,110
support

161
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,050
so we go all the way up from traditional
PC based

162
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,880
to image-based we can do the traditional
use be

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,170
or I so all I txt manipulations we can
if we doing image

164
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,240
obviously use the data or SSH to reach
out to Damon

165
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,380
to the system involved and as a

166
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,689
complimentary when you create a new
system for me all

167
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,180
automatically creates the DNS records if
its peak see the TP reservations

168
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,530
required for the PC

169
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,199
and TFTP and Certificate Signing all
kind of things that are required in the

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
process

171
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,330
I'm we have also pick sea-based
discovery

172
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,840
this is more for the use cases up I have
a rack of servers

173
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,480
I turn them on I want the automatically
show up and start managed I don't want

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,870
to

175
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,830
inside and mac address for every you
bare metal system I got

176
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,790
the stability just two discover all the
system that basically

177
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,280
launch into a many fide a cent OS

178
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,040
a operating system that is like a live
CD

179
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,329
reports all the inventory and then you
can make decisions based on that you

180
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,170
wanna automatically provisioned

181
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,860
or select this system belongs to this
organization

182
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,870
or the stand and so on um

183
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,180
we're also the yet sorry operating
system agnostic so

184
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,280
will happily install for you any of
these

185
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,420
a operating systems a and others if you

186
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,510
willing to send the patches along the
way

187
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,900
a so Esparta I mention it earlier but
it's part of the creation of a system a

188
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,209
lot of things are happening so it's not
just enough to create a VM

189
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,960
and maybe its storage I also want to
create that the NS I want to sign a

190
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,050
certificates

191
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,339
I wanna make sure if expressed
specifically for

192
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,430
for bare metal and Vera I want to
control the IP address

193
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,189
so we have like the address management
and I that we offer automatically and on

194
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,430
use IP address

195
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,609
and and a lot of things that happens
when you create a new system

196
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,420
that's completely expendable for plugin
system there's a

197
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,469
hope plugin hoaxes that allow you to at

198
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,570
your own hooks and we try to

199
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,230
when something fails we actually make a
lot of effort to ensure that we don't

200
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,660
leave

201
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,100
stuff tackling so if I create a VM I
failed to create the storage or factory

202
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,130
something else I'm not gonna leave
something in the air

203
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,900
that you IP address will be used and no
one can use it anymore

204
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,959
for example now

205
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,310
now we've we've been around and we know
that most of these features are mostly

206
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,910
for enterprise users people who have a
very complicated and large environments

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,880
and that regards we obviously integrate
with either held up Active Directory

208
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,500
Kerber of

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,930
and whatever here SSO approach if you
know how to

210
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,969
configure remote user: in about you for
example

211
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,670
we had our Barack we have detailed audit
logs

212
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,949
and we also have multi tenancy
multi-location so

213
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,330
you can go up to the the final location
as

214
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,650
I don't know resso or you can define
wreck 5 in

215
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,740
bristles Data Center West whatever
someone so

216
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,830
there's a hierarchy I that you can go
down in the final patience is so

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,850
we try really to make a

218
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,440
traditional sysadmins lives a bit easier

219
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,589
obviously when we have this kind of
system we would know

220
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,640
which resources or the administrator
will define which resources are

221
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,339
available for example for

222
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,720
which location are organization so we
would know that this

223
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,860
network for example is accessible in
this building or this network

224
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,740
or you know something in your
infrastructure is mapped basically

225
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,450
to a a given context a given context

226
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,589
the q/a team willing main be allocated
to different resources than

227
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,550
engineering team and location A or B and
so on

228
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,240
I'll no foreigners really really
pluggable

229
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,320
the lot there are a lot of plugins this
is really just the

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,500
finalist of logins plugins could be as

231
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,920
a simple as sending a u-boat you

232
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,930
sorry a you put notification or

233
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,859
as comp complete that or feature full
features like as

234
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,230
Patel over content management and this
really a lot of

235
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,220
everyone can extend this is tradition of
your Ruby on Rails developers

236
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,420
this is a just rails engine with some
API around it so

237
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,180
it's really easy to extend and and at as
required

238
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,370
I'll obviously it comes with a REST API

239
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,089
I'm we have multiple versions of API

240
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,530
that we we know that you know API's one
of the

241
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,760
most important thing we try not never to
break so we have

242
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,439
we went through the exercise adding
multiple versions

243
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,610
and out of the API the res 3ds

244
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,920
I think one of the things really useful
is the powerful search in PI

245
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,120
that means we have a release reach a

246
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,459
search language which allows you to

247
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,430
figure out and find the exact resources
that you're actually looking for

248
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,339
regardless the in the specific context
so you can easily

249
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,360
automate over the API we've specific
search query

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,430
a and you can fully automated a very
natural example is

251
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,109
I want to monitor or something which
what do I need to monitor or so you can

252
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,630
simply define a search query

253
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,920
I want to monitor all of my web service
in location

254
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,579
bristle so you define it as a search
query you feat that back into your

255
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,939
configuration management

256
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,510
and your consideration and systems
conceivably that

257
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,660
managed or I'll start monitoring it
automatically

258
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,390
you don't need to start writing all your
customized a

259
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,310
scripts that whenever a new system comes
up I need to add it to my monitoring and

260
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:09,569
all

261
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,829
all kinda I things like that

262
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,310
I'll try to show if there's enough time
will try to show some demo around that

263
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,949
we also have a full-featured a Celi call
hammer

264
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,979
I'm similar we took the approach of the
get submodules

265
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,250
so to hammer and similar commands it
uses the

266
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,360
be too API and it's actually built from
day one

267
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,709
to support forman plugins that means
that if you write your own

268
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,770
a plug into forming you can actually
extend to see a live with plugins

269
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,060
that automatically a dynamically learn
from the API

270
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,969
are in various options that you can
thank you

271
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,189
now I wanted to put some me so call you
know try to put a bit of

272
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:54,699
all over real use case that the actually
use for men

273
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:58,030
that may be more bit more relevant room
and

274
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,380
I think deploying OpenStack is something
that a

275
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,490
pretty large topics been discussed
heavily and

276
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,800
as you saw earlier this triple 0 this
quite a lot of different tools

277
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,280
every configuration management to has
its own set up

278
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,560
recipes to deploy it and we try to make
this

279
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,650
problem a bit smaller a possible

280
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,250
I'll and using a customized woman plugin

281
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,110
and I'm so I'm just gonna show you a few
a screenshot so

282
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,050
this is based on our geo for those who
don't know are to:

283
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,400
is a distribution of OpenStack

284
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,240
for cent OS and rail base operating
systems

285
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,069
which is pretty easily too pretty easy
to install and total package then

286
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:50,060
and and all of that I'm and Rd own phone
actually comes together bundle together

287
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,619
see if you using are the only an
accidental format

288
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,220
their configured when you configure the
audio repositories

289
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,250
and this case is just yum install and

290
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,020
for men form in OpenStack I'll

291
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:08,270
the installer and basically we get back
to form in with a set of slot you know

292
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,050
screens

293
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,829
that allows great a given that open star
cluster

294
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,490
so obviously you can create multiple
clusters of OpenStack

295
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,660
you know staging testing small meaning
latest whatever

296
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,030
a and you can just be fined tries to the

297
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,550
guide you through I'll for

298
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,120
for the various you know what is the a
bit about the networking

299
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,510
a bit about various

300
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,020
farm it is a few I don't know if you
have a che off-roading IP's

301
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,760
I'm and allow you to override any

302
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,270
a different values it also automatically
generate passwords and we try

303
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,790
it's not perfect will be tried to
simplify the process of deploying

304
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,060
OpenStack

305
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,500
still someone with Alan knowledge can
actually even

306
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,210
deploy OpenStack in relatively
straightforward manner

307
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,990
two to three screens click Next and
Rowntree OpenStack

308
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,650
there's a lot of options for OpenStack
and I think the diversity here is what

309
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,059
makes it so challenging because there's
a lot of

310
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,090
I'll overlapping combinations in
OpenStack

311
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,629
and this is a real problem for
configuration management in general

312
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,240
and we're working hard now in coming up
with a new approach

313
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,430
in in the configuration management area

314
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,430
to try and and solve that but I guess
this is another

315
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,240
topic for another room I'll generally
about four months community

316
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,520
the the project is about four year old a

317
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,450
roughly 200 fifty-plus users on the
mailing

318
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,680
on Darcy and some pictures here you can
see

319
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,510
a we're trying we're growing as we go at
me as much as we can

320
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,700
these are roughly the numbers the

321
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,120
most of our users or I would assume all
our users are enterprise users or

322
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,889
users with infrastructure otherwise
doesn't make sense to use

323
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,920
this kind of a product I'll

324
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,050
and I hope hi

325
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,220
convince you bits to get started I'll
try to do a demo but in between will

326
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,890
pause for a second for questions I mean

327
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,580
the get started you can obviously see it
on the website if you go there some

328
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,620
tutorial videos how to get started

329
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,649
we have a really active IRC channel and

330
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,720
decent user group so

331
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,830
if you have any questions before I try
to do a live demo

332
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,309
go at now's the time

333
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,910
yep how to deploy Windows that with the
question

334
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,170
can ask you a question back why no
getting

335
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,340
I

336
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,570
alright Windows Deployment at the moment
it's possible for image-based

337
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,750
provisioning only

338
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,060
I'm so if you have a a template in over

339
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,379
or an image in OpenStack and so on it's
possible just like any other

340
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,190
I'll you know if its user data

341
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,260
driven or SSH weekend ok into that

342
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,030
and yep your

343
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,490
sorry your provisioning method sounds a
lot like

344
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,900
would razor does you guys in today with
razor are so

345
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,410
so we don't agree razor directly there
are some overlap

346
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,640
ball I'll try to give background to your
question right

347
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,530
not sure i won understand raisers the is
a great provisioning tool

348
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,690
on started by overlap

349
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,820
they're here I'll which has

350
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,490
started from day one with the discovery
principles in mind that means to you

351
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,960
turn on servers and they can
automatically assign themselves

352
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,570
roles be functionality based on
predefined roles

353
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,669
arm for an excessive before

354
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,860
and we added the discovery functionality
similar to raise or somewhere around

355
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,469
after raising started we did consider
using

356
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,810
razor is a compute providing informant

357
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,220
a and but that never happened from

358
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,360
one reason or another it's not a you
know we had a lot of that logic already

359
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,330
didn't make it didn't necessarily feel
right to rewrite that point drop all

360
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,610
those stable lines of coke

361
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,439
for for out are at that point in time
you know

362
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,470
a bit our alpha product I

363
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,340
I think today razors a great product if
it solves the problem that you

364
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,800
if you're facing it's great and you
should use it I think we're trying

365
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,020
aim the overall use cases

366
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,220
razor is a service in that regard that
it can

367
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,930
create bare metal systems that you can
consume very mild my bare metal systems

368
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,400
this case we're trying to add another a
few more they mentioned the management

369
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,140
of

370
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,790
the whole I'll problem but they

371
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,610
okay like more questions there any

372
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,649
get I'd

373
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,200
like to see the future for me let you
see the future forming where they see

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,280
the future for men

375
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,120
I'll so there is a short short their
future in the long term future

376
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,419
I'll short term

377
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,560
wanna the involved

378
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,700
one of the completely new two main

379
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,450
functionalities we're adding to forming
besides a

380
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,600
enhancing the confidence we have is

381
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,639
personal everything around content
management that mean

382
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,010
the ability to classify your content
management life cycle so what is

383
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,050
production which packages of production

384
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,750
what do they mean how do we do testing
and staging and and how do we

385
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,370
promote content from one point in time
or one

386
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,889
said a function out to another so when I
deploy a system

387
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,470
I'm not just randomly getting a set of
rpm

388
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,620
for example repository and configuration
data

389
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,149
from a seven point in time where I
installed it but actually

390
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,270
as a way that you can say this is
production

391
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,280
I can I can be pulling my production of
this production I can take the

392
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,490
production that was five years ago in
the point now

393
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,720
again to really try to look at the whole
continent problem

394
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,890
something which is kinda a snapshot of
content

395
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,920
that is consumable as you go forward
this is important with you if you have

396
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,450
to have

397
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,540
multiples I'll versions

398
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,639
of your production maybe you have two
sites and once I can

399
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,710
perform a change in the given time the
others I can perform a change in another

400
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,120
time

401
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,600
argue orchestrate all that that's one
thing

402
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,790
the other thing we're working on we're
working on extending their

403
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,230
remote execution framework in this and
more for complicated workflows

404
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,150
so if you need to dynamically
orchestrate change across multiple

405
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,040
systems

406
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,420
you know I'll take a and I'll take an
example from

407
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,650
from over for example when you want to
upgrade

408
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,790
a hypervisor you need what you need to
do

409
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,668
you basically need to go the chai
provide put it in maintenance mode so

410
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,520
all the PM's running on it will

411
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,129
live migrate to another VM then you
wanna upgraded packages may be for karen

412
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,179
was upgraded you want to reboot the
system

413
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,500
then you don't you wanna go to the next
one you know put

414
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,060
take it out on maintenance to go to the
next one a into the south

415
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,159
cycle again this is just one example of
often orchestration framework that

416
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,150
as a problem that we're trying to Sol we
want to build a framework that is easy

417
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,750
to use

418
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,919
that can automate this kind of work plus
and there's probably a lot of things

419
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,500
that

420
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,990
happen you know is an open source I
project

421
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,410
where amazingly surprised the pull
request that we get

422
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,620
so the site that I have no

423
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,360
you know where we'll well will be in two
years

424
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,360
we'll see alright

425
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,620
or questions only this guy

426
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,860
were okay alright

427
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,860
so I'll try do given we have enough time
right

428
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,189
david is a nap time enough time

429
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,650
okay cool so I'll try to jump into a
demo

430
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,330
if the gods Wireless will allow me a

431
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,750
see alright so this is foreman's

432
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,050
a dashboard I'm

433
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,870
in here we can see a better and a pie
chart

434
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,270
showing us what r which state are
systems are

435
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,160
so I could see that forty percent on my
systems are in OK state they

436
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,280
that means that they've Ron
configuration agent on them

437
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,330
but a puppet and up and executed

438
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,790
and there were no changes that means the
policy that the predefined is applied

439
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,178
everything's working great move on they
are think basically means

440
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,860
a nothing happened so that the agent did
not run and we don't know whether to

441
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,330
what is the actual state of the system
at the moment and no reports

442
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:59,050
the I no report means never send the
report

443
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,220
not so interesting there's also other
states this is a life system or

444
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,750
my laps set up so there's there are more
rare earth but obviously something

445
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,060
failed to execute

446
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,350
or things like that we could see I am

447
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,030
we have a Nazi

448
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,440
we have all obviously I it's too slow

449
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,669
try to see if I can I have a local copy
of the database

450
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,470
maybe

451
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,570
no okay will

452
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,418
go back to VPN but this takes a while

453
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:39,040
I so while you look at that the

454
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,310
I guess on my a so

455
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,409
basically I am this is to stop

456
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,800
I would encourage in the meanwhile olive
you to come we have a booth outside that

457
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,370
the

458
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,860
k building and also if you happen to be
in there in Gantt

459
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,550
on Monday and use they there's a
configuration management camps we can

460
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,928
ask more questions

461
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:02,020
is also couple more talks about are
continues in

462
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,860
integration infrastructure and
integration with Chef happening

463
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,750
a today and tomorrow and

464
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,850
on unless the now this is too slow

465
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,219
sorry I

466
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,080
the sites that I think I covered the
basics there's more question to say

467
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:28,000
save me so go ahead

468
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,400
the question was what is the relation
between former then heat

469
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,520
or is there a every nation ship between
former nanny

470
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,639
at the moment there is no the
integration between foreman and heat

471
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,020
I would love to see one I would love to
see heat

472
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,970
be able to consume resources from
forming that would love to see forman

473
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,090
the manage he templates I think these
are two things we would love to see

474
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm and yeah with

475
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,190
that much in a bit too small I'll

476
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,179
but I generally this is at the moment is
no such

477
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,570
such them yes

478
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:16,570
question back yep

479
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,740
okay so the question was if there's a
plan to

480
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,960
fix host group by okay the

481
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,080
so this is only for those you actually
using it and

482
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,740
and know the problem a so host group I
have a nature or can it be able to

483
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,310
inherit

484
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,169
so you could define a top-level pace

485
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,250
for my app and I love that you can say
the my database and my web

486
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,190
server or my whatever functionality and
you could go nests

487
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,670
very much unlimited level of a

488
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,010
down in the tree and you can ship
armistice between those

489
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,580
you can share those benefits you could
be fine things that are common thread

490
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,699
to and share information between those
using search or

491
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,840
other mechanism I and one of the things
and I

492
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,470
correct me if I'm wrong if I translated
correctly but what you mean

493
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,170
basically that ability I not to redefine
public office or

494
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:23,170
what what is the exact problem okay

495
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,070
so so at the moment informing it's
possible to

496
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,310
so we started with the term host group
and later on its actually going to

497
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,810
something

498
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,840
we now look at the system definition and
if we look at this

499
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,949
look at it from Asus as a system
definition going to view

500
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,410
it doesn't make sense persistent have
multiple definitions

501
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,220
and but to solve that specific problem

502
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,150
we we are now will be working in the
probably in the near future to

503
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,750
handle a classes

504
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,370
and classes group that can be reassigned
so take what you look maybe as host open

505
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,219
try to

506
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,610
expected to another object that could be
applied multiple

507
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,280
then you could apply multiple but they
puppet group a puppet

508
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,389
classes recipes whatever it will be
called and you could try to solve it

509
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:19,390
and out approach but this still be only
one post for persistent yes but will

510
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,659
will try to handle that specific use
case which i think what this what you're

511
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,090
paying

512
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,990
we can take it offline and maybe you can
enlighten me why we're doing it wrong

513
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,060
I'll be more than happy to learn how to
do it right

514
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,490
right anything else

515
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,400
okay arm let me quickly try

516
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,440
open some tab so they're bits not as
slow

517
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,520
so when we talk about and last

518
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,879
okay open the fuse you slide that see

519
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,360
okay alright

520
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,709
a this concludes the live demo a

521
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:07,710
the

522
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,360
more than happy to show later on we'll
make sure that we have a working life

523
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,830
then later on down the road

524
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,080
so you feel feel free to play
