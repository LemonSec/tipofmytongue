1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,990
to talk just to give you a rough idea
what we've been talking will begin

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,330
working on for the last

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,920
one-year maybe 18-month on if you're
following GC much development on a daily

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,610
basis

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,910
done there's probably not much news i'm
for you in here

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,070
but on most people aren't so you know
would just like to repeat what we've

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,760
been working on

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,800
I'm just quick introduction who are we
arm

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,050
I'm to Milan I'm one of two to my core
developers

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,720
aunt on researchers on the possum

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,660
well basically the same idea for last
year which is summer releases and

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,889
are probably also touched every piece of
code until now

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,070
right and we for we work with a trickle
a

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,620
arm into issue a consulting I am

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,959
bright voters a quick introduction and

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,539
case I'm you don't know was tissue a
especially a bunch of libraries

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,780
I to do multimedia processing its
pipeline based

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,180
comments but like the leg or you can
just take you know different types of

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,330
elements on decon hook them together

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,340
and you know your media flows through it
I've got lots of different components

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,150
pads elements as we call them

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,210
um we provide plugins a which you can
wrap other libraries around eighty can

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,130
provide all kinds of different
functionalities

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,679
and these plugins are basically you can
LEGO pieces that can combine

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,299
together and we provide a unified APRI

26
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,740
round although us 'em that you can use
to

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,100
to do a lot um right on we rap
everything we don't

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,548
im into everything from scratch but
their loss of you know lots of good

29
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,590
development stuff

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,200
worker that's being done you know codex
up in Britain

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,420
you baby have an impact et cetera et
cetera all these live in Sweden remained

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,299
we just knew them make them available by
our abstract

33
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,659
John we've got very high-level API v2 on
the play button or

34
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,280
your camera Photoshop for photo booth
have

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,170
application we have a high-level API for
God if you have a low level stuff you

36
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,799
want to do

37
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,860
very dynamic pipelines you can't there
some high-level API

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,560
missing I get there one day but you know
um

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,910
we integrate with other frameworks 'em

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,629
both in terms of being used by the
frameworks

41
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,790
on using other frameworks so you know we
can

42
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,950
we can be used and work in Firefox Class
A

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,220
you all that be integrate with words you
can use a

44
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,230
Windows on you know thought our goal is
basically to

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,760
to be a doctor work everywhere alright
what are you going to talk about

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,109
arm just what happens in the last year
or so extrema

47
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,910
arm because you haven't heard

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,720
released just 1.0 while back and

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,120
just 1.2 this the next stable release
version

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,400
on that come out last October in futures

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,129
arm the binary

52
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,209
platform support for Windows et cetera

53
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,480
and was excellent I'll us Android and
after that in the future we have to

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,510
throw 1.4

55
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,099
I just 0.6 dawn you stable future
releases we kind of adopted

56
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,310
hehe versioning scheme until the next
slide

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,569
right so

58
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,839
I'm just in case have not understood
mentioning because people are confused

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,799
by the friendly

60
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,810
so do 10 a co-ordination version not
develop anymore not maintained

61
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,239
don't use it funny stuff a.m. we realize
some people have to continue with it but

62
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,640
United forget about it 1.0

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,268
is the new stately I if we have a break

64
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,390
I can hopefully not for a long time it
will be 2.0

65
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,548
everything that the starts at one point
something

66
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,250
is backwards compatible it's very much
like norm what you love

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,760
basically a.m. we have taken

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,260
what we thought it doing regular we
started separating

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,349
future releases from bug fix release is
so we have

70
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,140
you know the cheaper drinks you know 1.0
and 1.1 1.2

71
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,458
bug fix release us on yours the big
computer version

72
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,459
a call from Portugal sixth right

73
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,960
so we've got a call issue a bugfix
release is we've done

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,198
crimp stable reform point2 1.4

75
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,280
arm hopefully is going to come out

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,440
from march/april um it took us a very
very long time to get from 1.0 to 1.2

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,759
bought a year and I think it's much
longer than we wanted to take

78
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,199
ritually we had planned to do and new
feature release every three months or so

79
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,400
that didn't work out so um

80
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,900
hopefully we can I think gold currently
is to stabilize

81
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,349
on the six months ago recycle so we can
roughly

82
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,810
to release on March April and September

83
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,410
total

84
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,729
by in general I think all the major
application world

85
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,810
on Porter to 1.0

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,830
'em

87
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,020
is ages with border Firefox now which is
being worked on

88
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:23,500
on and enlightenment us was 1.03

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,860
just a quick review arm what does bomb

90
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,380
10 actually mean what have we changed
you know internals just an API cleanup

91
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,600
a.m. stuff we want to get rid of stuff
wanted to fix

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
a in general from application point a
few the changes are

93
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,520
more than evolution revolution you know
if you have an application

94
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,770
most stuff same you will have summit

95
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,650
my changeup on most of the changes
affect plugins

96
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,659
low level stuff conceptually it

97
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,479
pretty much the same from a risk
perspective

98
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,979
young bugs with from risk perspective is
well understood how it works

99
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,400
health fighting work into action works

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,229
and we haven't changed that

101
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,479
but we did fix some of the big problems
on that we hadn't

102
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,590
10 memory handling et cetera

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,770
and hopefully well the one point i'd

104
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,198
from bindings are not provided by GOP
confection we could win

105
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,919
past because are custom me objects of

106
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,318
which were ma

107
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,139
special so G I couldn't handle

108
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,580
us but now we've changed

109
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,620
alright binary system in up on releases
for

110
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,699
will also thanks Android I'll

111
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,590
we can tackle these platforms with the
stream of and buy stuff using

112
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,630
open for much your friend works I know
includes

113
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,860
all plugins well almost all plugins if

114
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,259
any plugins missing on you with showers
and

115
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,289
at them it's usually oversight attention

116
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,349
unless they have in the port

117
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:14,409
but few shop

118
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,550
rights oh yes sorry development 1.4

119
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,169
hopefully come thou tomato market for
'em

120
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,389
with work on it then since September
never

121
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,410
communities by soon features

122
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,410
up tell you bottle that's way

123
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,949
saw one of the very big changes with its
for 110 and

124
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,370
the following releases Assam for Martin
integration

125
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,580
she wants to use all kinds of special
haha especially on

126
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,639
embedded devices stop like %ah
accordance

127
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,740
arm its wasn't when it was possible to
do that and sort and but it was

128
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,240
quite awful and technicians you really
didn't want to do that

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,430
so what we now have had some interfaces
to show all kinds of

130
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,169
arm well hard work on texts between
devices so for example you can share arm

131
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,039
a display and between all the elements
automatic he

132
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,690
we now have stuff to end the all kinds
of different

133
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,650
arm memory representations so for
example and $0.10

134
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,948
was only possible to arm have something
like system memory something that you

135
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:27,310
can

136
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,220
a look at what may look nothing else was
just the heck

137
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,919
and what we now can do is so we can wrap
stuff like him a bath for a gel images

138
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,019
art stuff like NBA's but this office of
papi I'm

139
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,529
Ben what's what's I edit quite recently
is some

140
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,790
we have Papa negotiation between the
elements of to

141
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,949
arm make it possible that's arm the hot
temperatures on

142
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,630
one the best possible solution of the
best possible combination of elements a

143
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,510
selected

144
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,689
that i've landed on your computer so for
example

145
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,709
while on most of the latest into lot

146
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,829
in a box with an Intel chipsets you will
automatically use that the EPI

147
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,870
elements from recording if it's possible

148
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,360
even without to the application having
to know about that

149
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,230
and then well over the last month for
you automated lots of

150
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,640
are for the improvements there over lots
of bucks

151
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,199
still and I think nowadays

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,339
it can just work out of the box

153
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,550
song what does this mean basically im

154
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,800
you're using stuff like what appeared to
adjust your home

155
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,620
the arm now did you play on your desktop
it will just use

156
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,149
the hot accordance that are available
without the applications knowing about

157
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,230
that

158
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,380
if they are improperly arm

159
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,600
also on on embedded systems like well

160
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,240
on Android on the rust free pie stuff
just

161
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,630
works and because of all these new
interfaces we added

162
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,939
now much less work arounds and you
actually have clean code

163
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,940
and you don't have to cry if you read
the court later on

164
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,850
really it was awful before

165
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,649
so especially in the Raspberry Pi I'm
what we are not at all is

166
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,230
proper integration of open exile

167
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,880
what is not possible for examples that's
just on this 25 dolla minicomputer you

168
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,310
can if

169
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,829
HD video decoding going 0 copy to the
displayed

170
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,109
it's just happening extremely fast
without using any CPU

171
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,329
and Sharpie by using this now nowadays
for well im just

172
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,449
media playback but also a complex stuff
like having a

173
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,430
my tits green display wall of produce in
some kind of streaming server

174
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,729
so for example on the Raspberry Pi also
some kind of camera you can use and

175
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,500
well its can automatically use the our
drink orders on the device

176
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,790
to produced HD BTUs

177
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,930
issue 64 and then you can send it over
the network and all this works

178
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,430
interest among our with odds I'll

179
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,430
anything special to know for the
application

180
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,360
then other stuff has happened G Steve
news TV

181
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,130
API was improved a lot fired into guys

182
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,180
again as I mentioned before lights just
working on

183
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,459
that wasn't the case before it was on
the promise farther last few years

184
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,880
that's just working

185
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,450
and now we're finally there now then
recently are

186
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,190
what was started to the is

187
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,209
decode elemental that is using the the
defendants to

188
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,199
decode API saw many of the arm

189
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,370
how to code it manufactures people like
companies like

190
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,019
well some some law I missed ya know
providing

191
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,050
arm you for the next rivals for the
harbour

192
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,529
cortex and we now have a proper plugin
for that

193
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:01,579
and again it's just working

194
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,670
far other companies well the other
industries

195
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,649
a bit slow Jim sometimes but to stop
this

196
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,760
coming out stuff is going to is some

197
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,170
well we see our thats they're working on
stuff and Tom

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,180
I think a in the near future we were
have proper hard for integration for all

199
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,439
the different search upset salt and
yeast RNA

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
be in then some other things

201
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,260
that have happened to someone now the
OpenGL tuck ins we have

202
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,930
open jails bit special your country can
really use all kinds of different

203
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,489
threats

204
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,279
in OpenGL you have to do everything from
a single threat

205
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,700
well changes to my with the problem we
are completely modest I did

206
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,000
everything's happening in a different
fat and does it this was

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,870
ok why it's difficult to implement but
Sir nowadays it's possible to have

208
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,829
all kinds of arm jail based elements in
your pipeline

209
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,160
that can interact with our problems with
us off the base and a man's

210
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,180
that can interact with problems both
other Harper

211
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,609
related and a man's so you can just for
example if your

212
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,839
a.m. appeared are some when your part
and it's just us

213
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,970
arm some kinds of the facts are
deinterlacing or whatever

214
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,269
joga dust and son well it's a county
runs on all kinds of platforms

215
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,930
works on all insects that works on
Android it works on Linux of course

216
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,930
arm works now on the russ berry pie

217
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,910
then we arm integrate lots of smaller
things

218
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,910
so for example on blues elements

219
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,019
were integrated so we know I've arm

220
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,389
well support farm directly using say

221
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,440
Bluetooth headsets from the three-month
then

222
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,769
arm not some work has been done on the
HTTP adaptive streaming protocol stuff

223
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,440
like it's a last dash

224
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,850
Microsoft Smooth Streaming so that's
basically what

225
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,670
everybody nowadays is to using for stuff
like video-on-demand

226
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,110
and also some work that has been done on
well

227
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,410
unfortunately doin stuff because content
providers want that

228
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,769
and even that stuff is not working just
a meh

229
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,889
than arm lot of work has been done on
and picked yes: apart and DVB support

230
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,000
so for example arm

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,720
well if you're up for some kind of ID BB
device and want to plug it into your

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,149
laptop

233
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,709
its probably going to work now if that
supported by the next TV BAPI

234
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,819
then OMW integrated issue 6 I've

235
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,850
of HTPC support

236
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,410
with no passes for that its integrated
in all kinds of elements

237
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,670
for decoding your company using our
really great decoder that this insight

238
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,839
early baby then with support while

239
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,130
for the next generation recorded from
are Google

240
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,490
59 codec which is also I think this

241
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,490
recently started to use it on YouTube

242
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,880
than we also have initial da la support
which is

243
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,920
whether next next generation good at
that this country did being developed by

244
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,870
axis and Mozilla

245
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,930
its not stable yet we're buds you can
experiment a bit with it

246
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,560
want the doing much useful stuff but if
you want to

247
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,479
arms help on development there with just
my you have

248
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,649
very easy ways to test all kinds of
video inputs that as to how the decoders

249
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,820
working and I think it's a a good story
books

250
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,620
from if you want to work on them good
because you can have all kinds of inputs

251
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,480
dark and the pages from and then put it
into the new encoder

252
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,750
then many changes were done on the RTP
RTSP

253
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,350
stuff both client-side and server-side

254
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,380
so what we now have to say and this
other for example I'm authentication

255
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,259
it's a part for encryption by our SRTP

256
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,279
with support for stuff like
retransmission so for example

257
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,839
I to be useless using you 2 p.m. packets
can get lost

258
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,029
especially on wireless networks and

259
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,860
some does not own arm support for web
requesting packets

260
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,579
that were lost lost this can happen
completely automatically

261
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,899
then we improve to the net kak support
injured small

262
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,310
so what does that mean way for generic
arm

263
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,599
object in just a month that allows you
to share o'clock of a single device

264
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,089
over the network with all other devices
so what you can have for example is

265
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,029
all kinds of displays shown exactly the
same video and audio completely

266
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,680
synchronized between devices

267
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,790
this worked quite good before already as

268
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,880
except for well on wireless networks
were sometimes it can happen that's

269
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,269
your lots very long delays because well

270
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:58,699
for example your country walking with
feel more by device

271
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,959
from your living room to your kitchen
and then you lose

272
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,030
what the wifi connection for some time
and then

273
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,530
it can happen that sometimes the pic it
is going to take multiple seconds under

274
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,020
its

275
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,199
arrives on the on computer and this arm

276
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,380
made the estimation of while the

277
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,309
use it mothers in transition to arm the
master clock inside the network quite

278
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,740
unreliable

279
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,429
but some some improvements were down
there too well

280
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,910
it can all these complete halt lyle so
that our

281
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,770
comp taking much much longer than on the
average

282
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,200
back its answer I think it's working
very reliable now

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,410
then we also have of course well in
support the greatest new

284
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,640
thing that is that people are already
starting to use now

285
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,470
especially in the GL talkin some the
women supporters really great know this

286
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,880
it's even supporting the new subs other
stuff so you can

287
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,559
I'll integrates Joe arm

288
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,470
you video via the arm reducing into
ballot applications

289
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,010
arm then the gym on then and GF GC a
distance of a societal ivers

290
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,250
were also border to 1.0 not some
improvements were made and

291
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,030
finally will now offer new PTV release

292
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,539
it to be is a video data are based on
just remind world they didn't have her

293
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,970
released since

294
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,500
I don't know three years four years or
something

295
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,840
and I think know when them making the
new sevareid

296
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,699
least you will have a good free video
editor based in just a month

297
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,929
they can actually be used and that's
does not crash all the time

298
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,240
like before really in the past it wasn't

299
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,390
in my opinion wasn't reusable but now it
is

300
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,600
and then of course with fixed lots of
lots of box

301
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,439
with budget under control again in the
past and that number to know we were

302
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,080
under

303
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,110
top 10 products with the most box now we
all love them

304
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,030
I don't know it would position we are
now the costs were it's not listed there

305
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,168
arm in and I think in the end

306
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,539
last yarn last one-and-a-half year we
fix the BART

307
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:13,679
one thousand 1600's box

308
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,110
sandbags along so lots of stuff has
happened them

309
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:25,110
of course some of them also feature
requests

310
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,120
them

311
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,580
right sorry for the audio North am quick
look into the future

312
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,710
I think about 10 minutes left I am

313
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,289
1.4 coming up in March April after that

314
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,160
1.6 hopefully armor on Sept

315
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,870
arm of course lots of new features a.m.

316
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,059
one thing we we really have no roadmap
is arm

317
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,210
documentation and tutorials I think we
need more focused

318
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,370
better documentation a.m.

319
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,250
just a minute com which has nothing to
do with Israel Project has quit quit:

320
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,950
Orioles

321
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,179
people complained about in confused so
cause a further 10% off for

322
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,799
and so we really is work on that
something

323
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,799
house planned I am in general there's
lots of stuff around where

324
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,320
a.m. with piece of the action of 5

325
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,610
cetera what kato et cetera that the
father

326
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,760
media fourth order for them to Gration
then you kind of special API to the cost

327
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,158
of

328
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,350
which we don't have interestingly it
scuttle something but the others pending

329
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,370
need to export additional information to
make all that work for you

330
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,908
and WebKit you picture in picture
different or do you type

331
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,559
supplied streams on

332
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,418
new boyfriend modes and Claiborne

333
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,049
be beat BT is that so subtitle stuff

334
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,418
with RTC of course you probably have
heard

335
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,480
just work being done to 3 videos one of
the group

336
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,710
biggest things we haven't really done
yet what's been done

337
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,179
you attend another a.m. some have called
for track

338
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,190
but it was sort of very separate from
the normal stuff you can integrate it

339
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,630
because

340
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,929
of the caps exploding stuff we we had so

341
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,280
but anyway in 140 we can do that we have
some very very minimal

342
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,549
if you live with that but this more FBI
that needs rushing out

343
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,299
so you know we caught a fish put our
heads together look at all the

344
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,330
requirements and figure out a way to
signal that probably

345
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,549
I miss as a bit messy just to someone
has to do it

346
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:35,150
it's on the road map office saying that
for years have an hour

347
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,260
a more hardware support this time for
real

348
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,600
a more hardware support well as with
most to but

349
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,139
when we're kind of making improvements
especially by the opened

350
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,409
a.m. Mac stuff the and the provided

351
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,059
with him since then those kind of are
narrowing down

352
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:58,149
before beautiful in its API for
providing because support

353
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,690
get author soon Blu ray of something up
for mentioning

354
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,780
only the truth is that the video long
people half

355
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,070
have actually doing all the hard work so
little I bring everything we just have

356
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,720
to look at in

357
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,659
shouldn't take much time I double there

358
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,880
I am alright from the south end already

359
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,179
do you have any questions comments

360
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:29,179
anything at all

361
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:39,929
are yes

362
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,250
so can you give us as in

363
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,559
but we're no discovery

364
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:02,559
yes sorry

365
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,240
we do have a plan for that

366
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,650
we have to figure that out a the idea
for the device discovery and

367
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,260
actually mention the first discovery
have a

368
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,450
but yeah um for its global

369
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,180
was cock blocking me currently but
written the idea behind that is it

370
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,130
supposed to be a very simple API

371
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm targeted at work we know what the
occasion

372
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,910
now want basically you have an
application says you know

373
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,050
give me the camera devices will capture
devices will give me a list of Duty

374
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,810
drive

375
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,520
them or sound output for something

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,580
I mean it's supposed to be very very
high level very basic

377
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,030
it's not supposed to be you know you can
discovered by

378
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,730
everything that's we're not gonna it's
gonna be simple

379
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,010
and we probably I mean it well possible
that were gonna say

380
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,930
which is loud so but I mean I don't

381
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,570
any other questions for

382
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,570
I don't know have you been looking for
transcoding application to stream

383
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,440
first chance my get on for example a.m.
have to try that

384
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,950
well as its list I think very simple a
supposed to work quite well

385
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,450
a North if you have a million options to
do stuff

386
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,600
there's a 44 project called

387
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,199
Chen Tron 'em which is more like a

388
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,220
command line thing was different

389
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,950
specialized support for transcoding we

390
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,860
we've just the thought of in but they're
still think he could do better

391
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,969
I think applications accessed I'm we
don't have dedicated transcoding a PR

392
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,390
yet

393
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,490
something the Transco them

394
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:02,490
something on the list the question

395
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,129
in who

396
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,860
where am yes we have your tests for
fourth in the

397
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,229
in order for 4G LTE second one you make
chechans Austria

398
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,240
kind of tests all kinda stuff you can
run make

399
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,399
Czech Dutch Shell grind runs will be a
test for the grind

400
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,110
'em that we have there with

401
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,990
on the thought of test REITs which you
can run over

402
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,409
media files this work going on

403
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,059
to integrate all that into dinkins'
cetera

404
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,668
so it's you know it's not perfect yet

405
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:48,799
this quite I can imagine of the stuff
fuzzing

406
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,059
we don't actually do it but the truth

407
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:55,279
there are other people who do it and
they start fighting bugs signs

408
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,619
but also well their commercial vendors
which

409
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:03,279
which is all stuff in the products and
usually on that internally

410
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,929
touches I mean who in the look at a
South

411
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,710
stuff applied for the first time wasn't
someone just spent

412
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,610
working fixing hopefully we haven't
progressed

413
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,809
I it's not something we actively to but

414
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:23,678
I think in general it works well

415
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,249
I mean you can run just to discover a
territory first filed

416
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:32,720
on

417
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,619
of course also there are lots of company
for used instrument only for the system

418
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:40,789
they have actually quite good test
suites which

419
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:44,570
public but you can tell because
basically you to change in

420
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,820
they come back later were you know you
change has course

421
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,369
following problem if you run the earth
you know five days non-stop

422
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,459
God okay good

423
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,039
great thanks so or sometimes they funded
they have stuff that

424
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,100
runs the same test oval again

425
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,459
like health you know the failed to book
one

426
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,629
every two million times the race
condition mean that they exist

427
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:16,230
them not and there are some effort of
going on to push them

428
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,179
that stuff public some you API that
people have developed

429
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,590
and assess sorry we r

430
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,539
at the end of but also thank you very
very much for coming Iraq
