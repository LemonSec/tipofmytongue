derive

94
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,609
speed appears mandatory and I haven't
seen anyone using

the special specifications spiceland

185
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,640
to pitch squandered better be some truth

186
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,040
just not working for a full when it just
makes you want to

187
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
grew but by just

188
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,780
repression IP network you can simplify
the implementation and we're just

189
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,720
were even answer over social welfare
what I don't want

190

channel but the form of a dipper and

193
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,280
temp is usually used for streaming so
when you want

194
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,310
a truth to front bumper replace the
stream

195
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,680
thanks but I'm a problem at both
gumption

196
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,180
foresight the 52 inch producers but it
%uh

197
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,760
from on which the mission of the
connection wanted to

198
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,490
IP setup you have to wait for the think

when reproduced guide to the sink

201
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,060

web to times but his penis is the
problem show

203
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,620
the forced to fuck streaming if the them
both but more than they did

204
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,650
good message was which for

205
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,140
forced ruthlessly try p and I said no to
the special

206
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,290
think nothing of I much prefer

207
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,329
to bring them and stuff going for

208
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,390
speechless because

yeah them

211
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,219
good green pretty if if

212
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,600
HTTP basically just with different
command

213
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,709
and you can just hop into bed and it
works

214
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,739
don't that's prime something new to you

215
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,900
from maturation thing for us which

216
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,240
mode so supported the source that's one
of these modes

217
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,959
and you can select them a a profile

218
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,540
intensely provides Smith

219
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,050
you start streaming in the news out to
pee attributes in used

220
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,430

the trust vote stream of data from well

222
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,770
guess it's known just better from there
but I'm

223
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,600
for the sink a cheapy streams much you
say more

224
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,579
you can request remote agreement
negotiation

225
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,359
or other stuff but I haven't seen anyone
who spots the

226
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,470
arm to I'm

227
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,360
a bit confused asap premiere which you
can also

228
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,900
action went wrong birds a transmitted

229
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm 33 I AC

230
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,209
and from assume anything you want
basically

231
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,489
gotta remember to transport stream so
you guys

232
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,620
both reliable transmission for Robert
reliable transmission

233
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,230
me with you you need but i'm french teen
fuck you needn't

234
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,320
a good for encoder in

235
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,339
from hopper um

236
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,760
the Internet should be used to that but
it works

237
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,420
but with everything older than I'm
approach take smoke

238
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,029
that Olympics take the the books

I am my about working with the best

243
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,100
good action features you can use white
bitch you can abuse used to synchronize

244
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,210
the crops

245
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,050
so health good for bill of

246
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,020
these features which is spread thinks
but think mean

247
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,710
uniform from guys and one beauty wise

248
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,900
and the same me too me too divisive know
you

249
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,770
to the only device and connected to each
other you obviously need

250
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,199
to food because between 2003 but
numbered

251
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,770
production up and but the agency people
even bridges for

252
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,060
now I'm protection

253
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,339
one diplomat perhaps by goes

254
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,319
think to transmit a good day job
actually force

255
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,280
for you can have to touch screen and
achieving are you transmit me do that

256
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,199
only

257
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,220
budgetary and actually can interact

258
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,630
man scheme shut down I am

group a condom use Android

260
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,490
such at working

261
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,830
when I'm Christian

262
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,668
and then I pressman for fun no its not
working anymore

263
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:49,669
on try

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,500
when I think sperm just any decision not
to do during March 5

265
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,270
p2p so that which means truth
preparation

266
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,790
um from and

267
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,240
before specification a member this

268
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,320
being in force has to be the troop
operator

269
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,870
but if they're chief negotiation

270
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,379
s and this happens with Australian just
makes my

271
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,950
um me the same shit the

272
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,030
the probability kinda to anything

273
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:34,030
so %um I'm just runs

274
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,440
always to suppose

275
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
for

276
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,139
you can actually I'm one-sided

277
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:49,269
supposed to be really have a mortgage
you can see content

278
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,779
which means when dwight doesn't want to
be improved operator

279
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,799
miss smiles at you consent

280
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,820
just doesn't work doesn't do anything
anything Spain and

281
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,830
into 15 problem bud I kinda

282
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,830
I can say

283
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:21,149
cool

284
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,140
yeah

285
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:30,140
so I am

286
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,169
growth

287
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,860
and I think she wanted to show it on the
screen

288
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,590
well basement going to work because my

289
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,168
extra pressure when I used which you

290
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:57,150
on good I'm just putting it

291
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:04,150
and from so you concede up

292
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,159
I'm 00 p.m. going to you that but snow

293
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,129
some spectrum for display the data I'm

294
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,630
smaller connector and

295
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,980
can show you how the connection which
but that always takes like tension

296
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:36,000
scripts to booking from man move from
fancy features that ensure pass this

297
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,679
good throbbing cunt

298
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,240
doesn't transmit any better but once not
been

299
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,610
well norm frink you can but

300
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,149
into the bedroom a

301
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:53,178
from Texas okay

302
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,690
doesn't moment miles

303
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,289
like if you're movement

304
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:05,100
in the menu Batman a the touch screen
rotation and actresses stream

305
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,168
resolutions come Mb a

306
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,330
to spread it's not something but

307
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,860
from interesting thing obviously is like

308
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,120
something for bed through purge I'm so
I'm and from student section

309
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,100
good I'll works but nice regarding from

310
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,830
not continue obviously as he might see
this

311
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,330
want guess

312
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,580
me 100 milliseconds yep

313
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm had no chance again 30 for

314
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,729
but you can blame onto gets boned

315
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,580
the but should show that Layton's is not
s

316
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,129
but as you might think but maybe try
again was just

317
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:01,130
turn so you can but you see that um

318
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:11,258
was more attendance mission I'm up

319
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:15,080
look you miss you know obviously I'm and
articulate

320
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:22,080
hey a

321
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:29,220
communism with it you I

322
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,100
okay I could do that all day long but I
want some

323
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,289
good be feeling screen artifacts you
look closely and you notice

324
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,889
lacks which are in the from me decoder

325
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:49,889
which I haven't figured out why and get
these its

326
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,780
%ah to fly in trouble when the flag for
think

327
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,450
richest quite handy because he can use a
referee prime

328
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,040
a.m. smart and the technology curve and
pick for you can just bring it to you

329
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,700
too we

330
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,610
goods I'm over USB by many to choose
from

331
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,939
for dispersing budgetary sprint

332
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,050
you need to sit down spawn the show's
scripts Android

333
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,629
for and press your thoughts

334
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,290
that smoking as a much more interesting
thing

335
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,780
um and the this to grab

336
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,379
there are many for force a problem with
the presence that

337
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,560
good notes that you can use I'm

338
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,240
to potential danger for Jan

339
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,060
it was just a fire which is a contains a
reader

340
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,070
you on the street quite easy

341
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,210
but that's not what most people want to
do with it I'm

342
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,220
mistrust going to stop

343
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,220
got some extensions the youth actually a
second monitor

344
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,530
I have a problem with that said you have
to you we had a knack for travel

345
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,220
arresting or I'm a

346
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,160
driver and because that's what my mind
about the problem

347
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,200
some for the computer has to do song

348
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,360
but I'm may have to run its own tribe
about

349
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,520
because I cannot rely on the actual
based driver

350
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,110
some together with Brian and found I'm

351
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,179
don't know how to read explosive
occurred some point

352
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,780
but you have to from

353
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,410
gonna miss the country I'm which just
provides the second 2 p.m.

354
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,530
which is just an infant

355
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,700
myspace I'm lining up

356
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,790
so live from a few to introduce a new
card

357
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:04,420
but probably demand deposit I'm such a
perfect you can do with no

358
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,620
well French Immersion Irish just broke a
tooth

359
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,979
from some temper a 2003 to see anything
in connector

360
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,880
which is a space contrive I'm to
complete this constitutionally

361
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,140
to the magic up to use I'm to disclaim
won't use it s

362
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,460
separate monitor whatever it for months

363
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,000
Smith but you have to go through that
RIM

364
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,690
I'm just contrast to we are
characterized and personal growth

365
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,900
happened to a

366
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,250
go to the extent to spur on

367
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,440
was here

368
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,990
the but the chance when it comes to use
on the notes to

369
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,070
good some

370
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,428
I am

371
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:08,429
but think question doesn't make sense
because veteran best club team confident

372
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,990
we can do

373
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,670
and children who number what you are
doing missus

374
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,950
good computing a into account or
whatever

375
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,520
sprint card I V good manners for the
fake ID can use the other cops just fine

376
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,510
without running out

377
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,679
so it can run financial just for the
data

378
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,760
to the well but you can only do that

379
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,190
so im bunch

380
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,940
not good obviously use runners in this
scenario to

381
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,810
that I just ran to them

382
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,860
protests at this time or bud

383
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,800
might be

384
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,800
but friendship

385
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,490
occurred

386
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:38,490
mind take a while

387
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,269
got my mind not be working from

388
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,899
to sleuth mmm

389
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:11,590
would have been nice to see you bud
going to

390
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,529
sperm you can use the flurry of
corporate income

391
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:18,629
and you can news come to FB map to point
your

392
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:24,439
Linux both

393
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,929
nothing for you but

394
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,269
mmm some

395
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,720
gonna think I'm

396
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,759
term limits come so from one PC to
another one

397
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,029
and if you go back to working bomb often
succumb to and from working

398
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,769
but those you if you

399
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:51,059
record profits rose you know those
platoon

400
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,710
with an index component someone with
Matt but with anything

401
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,859
good I'm but

402
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,519
to the driveway gum fundamentalists in
the repository and

403
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,909
a Feb but took me four months to get
this transports of working

404
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:11,119
which is actually not really part of the
wofford as per specification because it

405
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,799
should be just 4:42 p.m.

406
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,470
I'm it should be implemented newspaper
claimed that was

407
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,730
including implemented for long spread to
bring the demos

408
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,119
this week and so it's pretty ugly from
gunmen

409
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,699
I am running again then brought in but
both people know about it

410
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,980
um small to interpret it into
distribution

411
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,820
or chrome or other stuff I'm missus

412
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,840
when we first need met with manager
commando other programs

413
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,389
to provide a pic to pre agree on before
they don't do the best we can to do

414
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,158
anything about it because you don't want

415
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,789
nor from to display

416
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:54,899
program %uh to control your temper

417
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:58,600
WPA supplicant because me finish each
month

418
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,859
over that but you sure you want to use
you know moon AP

419
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,039
I'm and dip internet access

420
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,539
know in the tropics my broker were

421
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,908
network implementation spawn provide
that slim

422
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:16,220
I'm that would be awesome credits
include of two

423
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,049
programs which you can run mom this is
think you

424
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:24,559
repair just excerpts pager I'm from the

425
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,859
the French mom just created this fake
cum loving wife

426
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,340
actually it would be got notification ch

427
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,580
interested friends just spawning in
command connect

428
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,158
do that easily from me a the school
system

429
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,179
yeah I'm appeared bugaboo trying to get
the smoking again

430
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:53,179
but if anyone has questions hello

431
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:05,960
care that um going to come from I think
you said about blogging issues but

432
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,019
you craze 22 decoding part does come
from and what do you want

433
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:14,159
rule out networking and but wifi

434
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,049
yet I'm the still feel new fees for
better for 15

435
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,070
but the shark but

436
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,309
hanging thanks to see if there's been
overdue local

437
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,668
a pic for decoding okay but to

438
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,059
both one more thing go away

439
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:35,070
before other progressed government
agency

440
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,779
um grandpa's

441
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,950
um from actually have one second delay

442
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,879
so and this is intentional on the
protocol

443
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:48,998
from Sohal I'm

444
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:52,590
don't think that but I don't really
useful form the same stuff

445
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,230
South for both source

446
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,249
so I'm not couldn't write to you too

447
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:04,039
implement them for 30 minutes a proof of
concept for a Comcast

448
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:08,359
cost I think bulbs I'm use to prevent

449
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,069
them were

450
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:19,069
course probably

451
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,500
up there's something similar in the sow
some theories I think or LG

452
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,730
I try these Nexus 4 Beach he supposed to
subgroup

453
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,799
mid-august but he didn't look at all I
just don't collect the three

454
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:35,980
but nothing happened you connected to
what to

455
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,449
some some theory I I think or LG I i do
not go to

456
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:43,589
K this from afternoon

457
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:46,710
somewhat better WPA supplicant problems
and so on

458
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,940
and I'm not the only one having them so
if you preserve the

459
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,750
except some problems and you really need
me to be lucky to get it working

460
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,770
good progress in the negotiations are

461
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,960
that's actually why I try to to

462
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,990
third tutor for a life this one part
which does

463
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,299
transport set up and the other part
which is the office but thing

464
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:13,890
became crazy any connection between two
new y sus you can use a soft AP which

465
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,930
has worked for years which looks
important BC y sus

466
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,368
just connect I'm fairly sure what this
poor

467
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,910
about IP network um both

468
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,109
notification but no bass was on the one
implemented

469
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,140
but something just for you

470
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,359
them if you can intend to buy products

471
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,970
with America support often do that

472
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,868
so i was just curious but the

473
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,319
the but for sure to put a smile XO the
source a few if you had a vision for

474
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,660
that so that we avoided copies as much
as possible when trick taking the

475
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,598
record buffer going over to the network
so to um

476
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,589
by somebody memory mapped out going to
the

477
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:02,750
I'm I'm militia

478
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,069
with the independent of the limitation
of the

479
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,970
trauma which one to the image so want to
do this

480
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,828
um support the german porn

481
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,380
and get the jam I'm the demand

482
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,549
handle from the retry must have no cap
computing important to try one

483
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:25,799
and BAM

484
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:29,059
I want to copy them because I

485
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:34,250
like to just Mamat buspar and to use the
spy from MySpace can do whatever it

486
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,279
wants but then

487
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,690
because the north and the south the
framebuffer well we're not allowed to do

488
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,599
that and a member of

489
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,770
can only do that in the coming because
you have to call soup you expect to gain

490
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,690
access and I

491
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,520
and access from for brother going to
Justin

492
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,680
damage on the new house handle damage

493
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,490
you just copied which stuff but changed
if anything that you do. dust

494
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,209
interim Scandinavian

495
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,630
can get access to the except the general

496
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,190
I'm and you can pass it to the PGA I
don't know whether it supports

497
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,230
them and you couldn't even do after
encoding from the from iphone without

498
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,980
do you think of it because otherwise you
cooking to the framebuffer

499
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,980
utopian can to the gym to you to get it
and could

500
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,399
a a how do you handle

501
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,290
a color space conversion when necessary

502
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,730
and a 30

503
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,850
over frames if necessary again and

504
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,118
what color space conversion become and

505
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,530
scaling okay spam

506
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,000
accident riches turn okay

507
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,170
for now

508
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,940
from to get a lot of emails from people

509
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,250

creating repository and some point

510
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,510
I've got like four emails from companies
which we're working on them

my questions just could you clarify what
airplane procon stop by implementation

531
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,540

sorry somebody made a report for the
Raspberry pfeiffer airplane

541
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,960
consideration but it works hmm

542
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,350

think back to before prop the but
couldn't get him

546
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,230
let's just use ipv6 are

547
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,530
which just might be nice perhaps

548
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,550
should come tell you much about

549

sorry growth a.m. I'm

550
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,420
look different to implement a different
political it's not the same

551
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,359
not compatible but a close to

552
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,730
close-ups it okay I'm

553
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,830
the US from truck so I need to get the

554
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,029
miracle support on HDCP year the ice on
knee

555
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,270
because some other wing miracast but on
E

556
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,690
with encryption and this is a beautiful
place from you

557
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,020
can implement HDCP um those

558
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,660
because of what you need a up by keeping
him

559
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,980
the I'm

560
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,170
I think you come got extra suitcase I'm

561
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,320
from babe should be about how to
implement

562
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,369
IP implementations already and

563
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:31,290
this is my question you minutes should
be very easy to use but you do it by

564
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,560
three different create the ultimate
spinning should do the HDCP

565
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,720
firm handshake on that already and

566
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,649
would be just looking into the serpent
moshe script mean im

567
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,290
but River bubble

568
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,609
the I don't have energy for the contest

569
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:57,609
from want use them hi

570
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:07,310

571
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:44,740
I just wanted to try but then one on the
top

572
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,400
I

573
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,799
and you mentioned a rest but if I
earlier and I'm yeah I think it's a

574
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:02,690
great device

575
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,249
these would make things a lot are not
paid by so I was wondering if you

576
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,578
actually tested those beings and I was
paid by

577
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,690
or on any other on device I run in Linux
for that matter

578
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,450
from the thing with very produce them

579
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,899
doesn't have fun um the

580
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,160
PCIe me show you import

581
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,598
sorry good news things account and all
the other cause a problem with Angela

582
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,880
bad just use nesha

583
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,690
the usual on for mmm simple fix IP

584
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,339
owned a.m. I'm actually working

585
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:42,420
and you can just not too light on any
other machine so it's not special at all

586
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,609
chief humor question you don't wear
including I'm

587
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:50,009
the decoding and just remind her from
what you've told

588
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:53,950
WiMAX a pink force something about

589
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,218
which tooth Prince Andrew plans
parliamentary picked up

590
00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:04,219
some sleep

591
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:21,460
but

592
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,690
and curious about the work that you did
with Dad with the

593
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:30,580
scream erring to be able to use it
exists or I had to be able to use Linux

594
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,410
is a source

595
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,640
and I know that you know when it's right
now there's a really bad problem

596
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,310
science up around mike candys life
screen sharing your screencasts

597
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,240
you think that's something that someone
who would be able to carry out of there

598
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,470
and use it for that purpose

599
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,180
for screen sharing means like it

600
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,430
alive screencast so
