1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,129
so next big markets think I'm

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,740
talking about us I O p yes room

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,870
expected yeah follows three which is the
the next

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,160
release of RO anthem before

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,770
I move show you what actually 403 what
we did

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,710
and wanted me be in general about it so
you have already seen enough are already

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,109
here

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,380
in the first talk because already I was
reading post

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,979
the resistor very soon and so he decided
to use the the latest no

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,040
so what is far as the language in an
environment

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,170
where the and mining means a

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,739
for programming language programming in
Burma and buy 'em

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,968
with who headed toward Obama and every
it's a simple English

14
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,590
small talk right now although very much
compatible to the rich a small talk

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,460
I N it's all taken away and its dynamic
and especially is extremely have

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,739
reflected so that means

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,410
it's implemented and says and you can
change inspect everything

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,930
of the language every

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,630
so the idea actually is dead we want to
be used the word ima programming

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,689
environment so of course

21
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,389
loss to go to everyone see how it turns
out but that's the end.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,720
and call so far as I might be nice

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,880
all amazed but also makes hills and
minerals %uh

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,420
looking at the more weather up more
space but that's a bit difficult because

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,030
they don't

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,229
logic compilation be done it so that
means it's personal

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,119
we have a growing a really nice
community

28
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,450
up very long as far as improving
steadily

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,960
so actually there s almost no de año

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,298
way I there was not something in
improved

31
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,780
open its ok of course very simple but
sometimes it's big and a half ago

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,799
I reason text on a project that use

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,430
are all like we saw in the first of what
some believe this baby mama project so

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,200
far most other than to donate

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
about hello really is already over

36
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,140
relatively late in 2009 and October and
since then though we had all in all five

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,920
relievers

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,539
we shove it up your isn't stable which
was released

39
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,660
last March so last year's talk here at

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,750
post and was actually a modem what we've
had done for Farrah to

41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,890
and that he would release it soon and
the interesting thing is

42
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,569
that he managed to do almost everything

43
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,670
almost all the things that we were
actually planning for forestry that he

44
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,839
is that we want to do

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,180
one released for you for the next twenty
years or something like that

46
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,129
so some that means dead

47
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,518
a we yeah War II who they'd always
follow

48
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,450
and the file photo i William discussing
what that means from a time

49
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,950
skating so we started in March 2013

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,290
we I am if you look at the bike trail
guide you through the whole

51
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,379
he should have every state forestry then
you re then you see that is 2021 that

52
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,170
book lost

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,018
since March this is quite a lot so that
means the sum

54
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,550
this is not even 300

55
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,239
days and the easy though he was things
happening every day

56
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,510
so when he bill submit and

57
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,268
and he should check up fix then the six
is automatically verified

58
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,700
a by running more tests and then we
combine three

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,238
fall those in who are they obviously
have

60
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,599
around 123 per day and made

61
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,970
since March 18th last year we had
certain %uh the other

62
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,549
policy I'm

63
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,200
so that means a lot of things happened
and we still have a bit to use before

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,510
teenager fully just take the pin to six
until we can release

65
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,810
but we hope that we will do that until
much not so

66
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,640
lots of activities Yahoo this guy made
in December so it's already validated

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,279
I'm there this is the release date of
harlem

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,920
and his political prisoners and as you
can see the

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,420
open issues stainless constantly have
always constant

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,720
all the usual wrong hi i'm looking for
to 50 50 50 shows

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,870
it is really difficult to be get that
down so I always

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,790
try and be all this that have strained
so we try to get these numbers for you

73
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,610
but there's a few things constantly be
sold people open another

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,970
should record entries a.m. it's a

75
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,919
they get close can easily managed to
close to those issues like a entries

76
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,639
a within the development of forestry

77
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,919
anthem one of the reasons why we were
able to move

78
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,180
well so much faster than the house is
that the now have a booking

79
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,740
continues integration infrastructure
this is a few provided by

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,020
in the eye which is a French a a
government researcher

81
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,000
natural does I'm and they have a sense
for them

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,900
continues integration into such a bill
on Jenkins

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,229
and we can use that to build a hoe
infrastructure I V use that extremely

84
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,150
lot so that means every fixed that
someone submits

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,270
is made a ton of domestically for

86
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,270
the latest version of our own that is
developing which means that runs

87
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,580
in this case only on the nose although I
am

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,630
16,000 test and only if these tests are

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,090
green this issue will you get tech to
you

90
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,198
both of you in with you everyone using a

91
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,310
kind of lead in style the at

92
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,900
checks to seize offer some tips on
forgets to put a comment arsov

93
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,419
the house threatens more DLC their
children who

94
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,740
let you for every face and then went up
they have tons of how it says this

95
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,080
update is very David on

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,500
on all three architectural automatically
so that it runs all those 50,000 test

97
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,199
three times

98
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm and of course after that there was a
new home

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,139
but so far and that means that all to
issues that have been already checked

100
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:00,550
will be

101
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,300
a review they would be retested so that
means we have a lot of

102
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,780
activity going on on this integration
infrastructure

103
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,090
a one up they put off our own trick us a
lot of jobs

104
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,929
once to really know that s on the
proposed up proposed fixes and you know

105
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,479
the years we have known her

106
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,789
using a CI so over speaks

107
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,860
aideed extra projects that a validated

108
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,020
often on on both sorrow are with us a
virgin and unstable

109
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,250
let me say one bush of another issue

110
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,310
303 VAT boots on the contribution so

111
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,460
and the contributions over looks like
this so it's so

112
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,729
homogeneous Leighton Buzzard eighty
projects

113
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,020
'em cites the continuous integration
here with me

114
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,448
and a lot of other infrastructure over
the years most of it really got stable

115
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:55,410
last year

116
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,060
which is very interesting but everything
comes together and whose you follow

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,199
so we now have a high so high so far
already have every other sorrow image

118
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,130
that have almost

119
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,630
but so the for release of every
intermediate update is available they

120
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,289
are so if you want to check

121
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,419
you from the learned that you use two
weeks ago

122
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,818
if this part really happened there and
not now when people

123
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,940
don't have this reason or you can go
back there was the whole

124
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,650
308 over there I'm we have guests over
all ages

125
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,198
you may always like everything is okay
so it's a

126
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,900
that site was a description they are you
sir w. guessed correctly installed a

127
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,479
computer Farrell

128
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,609
a systems if you go there with you you
probably can see

129
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,940
always looks like another one is a small
talk up

130
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,620
which is a this issue

131
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,090
you know he had like system was more of
a bitch instead of using you

132
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,359
use multi channel which is to
traditional I'm

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,800
revision control system that it was the
inventor for was quick

134
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,030
a long time ago all 'em

135
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,840
yeah and this one starts against white
use a lot to be a whole lotta thousand

136
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,520
users

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,568
and you to all wonderful visit us up to
get around 15 million

138
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,620
down doze off of virgins every day

139
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,080
so what did he do with all these two
thousand to update the issues and

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,500
lot of things so we had a lot of smoky
notes of course

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,270
so when at the philosophy in forrest et
nothing is too tribute to be done

142
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,150
so if someone why did reading holes
finds a tight hole

143
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,568
of course that is not really relevant
for anyone I mean

144
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,260
a typable missing I and the comment yes

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,809
but people actually when they read that
they actually is

146
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,819
stamina they have someone to fix that
and if they didn't

147
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,180
with a book to fix it we will integrate
so there is no

148
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,489
well but this is trivial we will ignore
it they're not so

149
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,730
a horse called face cuny's

150
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,149
I performance improvements memory you
know

151
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,850
consumption improvements especially
because he managed to get it

152
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,860
love memory leaks a and some

153
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,430
these their own another who was a policy

154
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,630
and well or not so small improvements on
the code base we have now

155
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,220
a a licence to a check-in the system

156
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,540
that provides a couple of I guess

157
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,449
wrong a he also checks of things that
should never do you wrong

158
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,570
so for example if there was an instance
level that nobody uses

159
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,149
why is it there just makes people think
of when you

160
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,440
do you need this kind of thing in this
class and then people

161
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,680
not understand any more than their
search around in the finals in houston

162
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,649
they lost in Minnesota life so we are
trying to improve all the small things

163
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,709
a lot of things but on them some

164
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,449
but of course they got a large
improvements to and to

165
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,790
not a lot of them I can go immediately
that it was not possible

166
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,130
so far as to who go we r at the

167
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,240
the close-up shots of that used to be in
in Seaside

168
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,310
created that into the system you know
you have a close-up a

169
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,229
that you intimidation you can use
directly without building C so

170
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,390
we have no use for them it was on their
own

171
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,959
from good news very nice you know who it
is

172
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,859
so by it we have a st. intro in trouble
now in the system

173
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,480
that a lawsuit to very nicely experiment
a small talk like systems by

174
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
changing it to visit all over that sucks
industry very

175
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,029
simple but Hokies we can actually run
the home

176
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,959
tests successfully I'm we had also if
you really think that there's no there's

177
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,750
a CVS

178
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,990
the Asian Tour although so that you
don't know him

179
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,250
in the Koch brothers 18 it also viewed
on me too goal

180
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,839
carrier to carrier about you can say
okay or go to the next

181
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,110
a ACU a obstruction

182
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,950
with a statement we had a nice for me to
move the

183
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,890
outlets a small speedos and things like
that

184
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,629
yes him

185
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,900
I'm moving

186
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,379
me holiday which one football

187
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,430
well

188
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,498
them to live

189
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:08,449
let closure yeah election congressional

190
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:12,738
I conjugation yeah you're right
continuation class

191
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,859
blocks are close but if you want to

192
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,889
programs continuations you all that's
needed to do to seventies

193
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,879
some people so one of the bigger
improvements that I actually visible to

194
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,149
the

195
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,659
to the user who don't look tomorrow is
the new inspector and actually want to

196
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,729
assure you that

197
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:33,059
quickly if I have the time so with this
little thing yes

198
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,689
%um witnesses okay so let's quickly
heard take

199
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,488
the latest row and started up

200
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:46,239
done so if you

201
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:52,849
if your sorrow that there is to it
Brandon Moss again general audience are

202
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:53,789
you have this

203
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:58,479
before %uh the world models the Scream
is actually an object that is

204
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,099
phone took over a very good point for us
and you can of course inspect that very

205
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:02,369
much

206
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,829
and so you getting inspector and did you
see that the suspect looks a little bit

207
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:07,549
different than the

208
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:12,228
voice you know so or more to see the
people it s

209
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:16,509
a select a at the at the top which
allows you to switch which kind of

210
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,839
Inspector you want to use

211
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,099
saw the smoke already since I think
smaller even so he said that months ago

212
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:26,419
moved to the kind of inspectors but it
was always to be hidden so

213
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,929
nominated to the parameters even didn't
understand that

214
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,858
when they look at the jury that this was
a special inspector that was not showing

215
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,919
the Europa

216
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,179
how it would look like that looks
dictionary like and we made it is no

217
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,098
the way less so that you see that they
are going to the kinds of inspectors

218
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:45,689
for certain objects and for these more
hot checks you know have

219
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,719
always four different inspectors
available one that is the standard

220
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,749
respectable

221
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,109
one is a tree inspector which is what
used to be the Explorer

222
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:57,970
which shows you every or the state of
this object nice unitary

223
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,409
then we have to hire a key Explorer
which officials to the mall

224
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:04,889
checked in the hierarchy that there a
graphic to things have one screen so you

225
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:05,879
can see okay

226
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,179
this is suspect we know and it has a
grip more fatalities

227
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,799
distinct and then we have

228
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,999
the just as at the mall something really
fun

229
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:21,119
which just shows the this graphic im
also and renders it

230
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:25,359
inside the the pros and ask this of
course around us what you see on screen

231
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:29,169
you get a really nice effect also an end
to this

232
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:34,589
inspect all of the of the main spineta
if you if you open now here a menu then

233
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,259
this bill

234
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,899
you a Colby step by step into the into
this

235
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,059
so it's kinda fun will dismantling

236
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,569
no because it just reno's the

237
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:51,039
the his boss at some point

238
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,869
think it has a Michael depp's so

239
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,279
kind of nice p.m. enter this this new
inspector actually has already been

240
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,589
proving to be a very a interesting so is

241
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,459
use a lot in our vision machine
experiments to arm

242
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,498
give us Special Inspector Morse formal

243
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:16,559
a past reuse intermediate
representations

244
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,969
and bill showing so that's what's going
on on

245
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,869
about this optimization which will be
very interesting

246
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:27,659
and we hope that we will see something
and I'll love and love the European

247
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,439
I which the benchmarks you saw that just
one show

248
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,589
which will hopefully be improved to do
before for

249
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,970
cock together is this a optimizer and
they are so useful to have this

250
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,509
inspector because you can inspect

251
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:45,099
all these things these Issa drastic and
optimize again and

252
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,279
introspect very nice so that's very nice

253
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,959
another thing that we are working on but
which the is a big project

254
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,478
is a a vector graphics pack and that
should replace the seventies

255
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,889
70s style that matter graphics that
drive so the system right now

256
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,409
so it's a new API for vector graphics
mode on FB i ways

257
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:10,079
ended a always I will %uh there was a
movie but actually buying my tits be

258
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,858
because polls he's not compete

259
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:15,289
in the senate complete have a boyfriend
but its movie spoon

260
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,019
goes on so been as usual like to very
few

261
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,049
janeane to stop him rendering but for
now it's Cairo

262
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:26,899
and we actually have this working in in
the current three dots here there's a

263
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:27,559
preview

264
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,049
its not get used to render the desktop
because that is a lot of more work to

265
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:32,439
the

266
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,899
to be done but it works already like
this

267
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,009
kind of nice soho host discordant

268
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:43,769
tigar meet I get the more

269
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:48,539
or on game or yes

270
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,899
so you can see here this is a a

271
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,639
both chase falls for the back to the top
and this is rendered

272
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,799
force book to

273
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,189
make this relatively smooth animation
all the time completely

274
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:05,829
white being copied around as a bitmap
quite a lot so to get this into the most

275
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:06,388
extreme

276
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,739
gets copied again and as a lot of coping

277
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:13,659
going on what and that's why so that
really that fast but the bus

278
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:17,549
and like something to use that as a
specialist can-bus inside

279
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,089
Mar 03 I'm but the future baby to
actually

280
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:24,949
replace the canvas that renders that
would sooo which do so

281
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,758
graphics framework and then you would
have a

282
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,999
a big bet on based system completely
very good

283
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,100
easy implement 'em

284
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,909
sumo for of this so so that when you
have high resolution that those graphics

285
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,589
from above small I know these things

286
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,169
and of course it would speed up the
horses in quite a lot to do that

287
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:50,329
so it's quite nice

288
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,649
but for all three have a ok and possible
that you can use a program about the

289
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,829
system itself doesn't get used to campus
to do

290
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:01,919
the rendering of this so then

291
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,319
we actually did a lot of be changed or
3.2 MP

292
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,759
invisible salah is a food place to small
to compile data compiled other takes

293
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,439
text

294
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,519
and makes Michael that was completely
replaced by early implementation

295
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,519
which uses to assess and that's the
problem

296
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,059
oil plumes which is very high heavens
which has a lot of

297
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,928
sings farm so it was i thinkin for
effects aren't we

298
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,100
another you the higher which is quite an
interesting to see a lot of flexibility

299
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,949
and that is the back end which is have
like a high level 74

300
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,539
a buy whole which is very much the
usability send along if you want to do

301
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:39,279
experiments

302
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,600
and you can actually be called higher
the whole system into

303
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,619
I'll this is a beautiful recitation many
related and then be image

304
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,269
by court and that is extremely fast so
because hiding the whole system takes

305
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,809
less than second using the

306
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,590
IRS and Asian but it's very nice you
want to buy equipment violation

307
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,830
but putting all the highlights much
easier to change because his

308
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,189
my visit was one of the other a

309
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,299
and if you use the base is one of the
nice things that using powerful

310
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:11,240
which PC maker a bit on the same level
is so if you place the hospital

311
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,289
because it s a a system that is the only
when you

312
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,369
want to make a fuss because making does
not that's simple

313
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,119
because if they already instances you
need to migrate the instances

314
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,279
that different kinds of classes so

315
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,139
is quite quite a lot of work to be done
at the hospital as we hope you cancel

316
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:33,869
actually I don't think that anyone
understood no

317
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:37,269
and no we replace it with a hospital
that this

318
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:41,889
'em much easier to understand and much
more flexible because it makes a lot of

319
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:42,949
things

320
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,599
into all checks that Moreno check before
and one of them is

321
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,289
so was lost now we have what every
instance revel in the system

322
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,460
we have an object that describes that
incident about

323
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,539
right now it's purely for though the
same that

324
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:00,299
business model is an instance rubber but
you have an object for it

325
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,730
but it's kind of nice of you should look
for example in the current for three and

326
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,599
you say

327
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:10,639
slot or instance a science

328
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:13,639
then you see that we have right now in
the system seven fold clothes and

329
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:18,219
differences so for every is that we have
normal

330
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,659
and so in in the second step this will
allow us to do a lot of really crazy

331
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,139
stuff

332
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,830
which we would see a dividend of sorrow
for presentation

333
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,039
on sale earlier leading European by the
regionals address the view from the

334
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,169
modern India even using them and it's
all

335
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,779
you can prove that its independent
mourners group is the

336
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,149
and he's good at using small so is
understandable as we can to help get

337
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:44,570
and then there's another nice feature
going on in Switzerland and Belgium

338
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,428
on this and they have really fancy by
the soviets that they want to provide

339
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:49,480
you to hit

340
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,029
so that you can providing only buyer for
your home

341
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,080
cases so at so kind of pro lol
implements

342
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,689
the only by Gods to the button very nice

343
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,080
another thing that we did is command
line interface

344
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,639
so because again so I think was because
I don't use all alone

345
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:12,059
and it really was I think it needs to
talk better mister

346
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,570
all 10 photos and one of the things that
this really nice to hear

347
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,339
is the 1 I'm interface that make sense

348
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:23,428
home I'm soul

349
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,940
if you will might make use of the whole
I and love and you can be mentioned

350
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,429
just look at it takes two minutes into
and you can implement %um

351
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:34,700
going to handle I did one of three or in

352
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,919
because if you know a

353
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,500
has really nice because this 100 can be
used in the this o.o

354
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,679
quite a quite nicely so you can just say
up

355
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,789
far of a and then it goes up because of
his brief moments of the Virgin

356
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,210
and Jason said what's up weekend

357
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,250
run the tests from home online which is
used in a bit so vocal

358
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,869
Yoshino voyagers evaluate public
expression

359
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,070
very nice 'em

360
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,689
so that was already the boat the small
talk system it says

361
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,500
and be on the infrastructure level but
not technical infrastructure but more

362
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,869
human infrastructure

363
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,039
we are starting to do a lot of things to
someone idea that we

364
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,589
made to you last year losers on a policy

365
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,799
is the purpose of issuing debt ideas to
ya companies using for all

366
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,510
forever and I'm there should be in for

367
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,760
in infrastructure setup so that they can
actually in invest into their own future

368
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,139
because if our old II 3u sorrows with
our

369
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,709
day-to-day vote men there should be
interest that basket fixed

370
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,760
that things get improved and their

371
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,010
we move forward in general and is your

372
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,559
a company that you always need to do the
things they need to do to get

373
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,839
you first must be so you don't you don't
have the time to do that at all

374
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,029
sometimes you have but also not and so
that you use the

375
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,139
companies initially a his money

376
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,029
one organization to organization should
be able to at some points to hire

377
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,190
someone full time

378
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,940
to think spots and and tomorrow so that
they don't have to do that

379
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,589
right now we have him members to unseat
the

380
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:20,760
are we have been yes he's a up

381
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,019
and response also sponsorship is still
kinda

382
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,539
you're not a member but your but you're
contributing

383
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,200
and to it's not get enough to pay
someone a full-time

384
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,349
but is already quite on a good
directions we hope that this will

385
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:35,529
continue

386
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:40,460
%uh in 2014 and he other companies that
are right now a member

387
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,129
a save your sponsors a couple within
handle on the website

388
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:48,649
to see them harm

389
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,168
yeah very nice this is really going in a
good direction

390
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,500
so or she wanted to have course
companies and individuals

391
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,789
being haha so it's number the problem is
that it was awesome is managed by any

392
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:00,480
idea

393
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,210
government entity was unable to attend
the

394
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,169
individual contributions and so we
decided

395
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,320
10 these 260 vehicles also for companies

396
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,879
and institutions and we have an
associate measures which I looked over

397
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,629
all 60 members

398
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,849
and ideas that at some point the
consortium in associate me to merge into

399
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,918
one entity

400
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,079
we will see in a couple of years another
thing that he is

401
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,839
I'm we %um reasonable

402
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,250
which has more so we have already the
are like some people

403
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,279
his be updating home are all 11

404
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,859
yes example I now have

405
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,609
more advanced topics in the second book
so it's not really

406
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:47,049
YM introductory things but it's more
Singson

407
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,510
top of our old like extremely my priest
that despite that were also the

408
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,679
visualization engine play that already
deep topics

409
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,539
like think there's something about
exceptions and

410
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,950
all day implement holdover I am yeah I'm

411
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,409
there is a viable in preparation someone
is interested to write something

412
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:09,679
it's always interesting in the third
book will be a vote following the

413
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,260
enterprise or more like

414
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,440
once a what do you need to know if you
want to deploy sorrow

415
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,089
profession no one and my greasy have
taken medium

416
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,609
covert 'em

417
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:28,269
before I he's stop one interesting thing
you're trying to do is to his

418
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,510
Prince regularly and Sprint other baby
me dress

419
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,320
10 to 20 people with the goal until six
boring bus

420
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,539
so as we look at the check-in checks all
the things that nobody ever wanted to do

421
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,240
because it just sounded boring

422
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,500
complicated and not the important thing
for and designed to get me

423
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,039
efficient so the last spring he managed
to fix 30 bus

424
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,500
up I'm before Christmas as well as

425
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,690
stuff together really nice to be to try
to do it

426
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,450
in many cases so if you want to organize
one you available both individual

427
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,059
we try to do one every months poem

428
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,440
not all of them are really publicly
announced bother around every two or

429
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,470
three months you want to make a really
big one

430
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,049
external parties participation I just a
lot of folks some other conferences

431
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,579
dante tried to set something up but
everyone can do that

432
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:19,730
if you're interested so

433
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,010
thats my presentations for following

and if you're interested help is always
welcome

435
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,099
I the percent what he will do asta ahora
sry

436
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,139
until next post and then after

437
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:42,139
to bring any questions

438
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,320
this you

439
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,340
yes was already done profile to

440
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,500
I and

441
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,509
preview you know but unlike

442
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,110
own

443
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,020
another packaging boats in the system

444
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,629
was very connected everything she a as

445
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,450
this being his old life with parents who
are here so we started to work on that

446
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,870
and %uh so that it was you very
interesting two-pronged approach

447
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,250
but this one is about one study for all
homes are closer to talk a little bit

448
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,130
and powerful

449
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,370
and the other one is about training
overall and

450
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,979
both projects as people who think that
they submitted improvements

451
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,049
so I think the improved a little bit the
situation but the problem is you're

452
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:28,168
looking for such a place to make sure
that doesn't

453
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,559
generating more and so they have a so

454
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,960
men men he then said okay no love for
all three is nearly finished some people

455
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,059
to actually looking at these things and
then

456
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,990
the eight but this is getting not bet
out but you can vote that use Cookies or

457
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,030
for what we need to really be the first
time to test

458
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:48,330
that there are no because it's so easy
you you think something and the

459
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,360
two weeks there's a lesson to give up
you're using

460
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,000
knowing that under this package and this
is a problem and then using

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,700
yeah but I didn't know yeah so it's
really important convo

462
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,500
although I love them from getting both
but there will be I think a lot of

463
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,150
progress and for all he was known

464
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,549
where people actually data we need to do
something that so

465
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:12,000
should be based on the thank you Jesus
the

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,160
already there from the beginning that
you always

467
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,940
%uh yes so I'll so far

468
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,760
for the real 'em yeah he needed someone
to your packages miss important all

469
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,790
these things but

470
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,350
this is a bit difficult to get right so
it's very easy to get it bro

471
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,360
and there's always the danger that the
open reluctant to say okay this is the

472
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,409
solution and then

473
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,429
is wrong the musical at some point is
becoming meet with parents

474
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,160
the first thing I think people who is to
put Lewis into place to check the state

475
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,770
so that

476
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,150
we the find is about to enter if they're
going to do something does not apply to

477
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,850
them

478
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,149
yesterday but so that means we need to
add nothing really powerful

479
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,090
spectrum

480
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,689
any other questions

481
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,410
six shots

482
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,520
now half an hour
