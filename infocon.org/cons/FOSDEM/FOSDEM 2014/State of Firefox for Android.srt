angina saying you I'm sorry

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,580
I don't know the world but well he is
very famous

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,369
in chess coating the other guy is Chris
Latta

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,519
so Chris was already here last year but
we are more than happy he has accepted

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,278
to come to gain and chris is a Firefox
top 100 programmer

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,820
um video game retailer in his spare time

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,430
he's famous in the London office folk
and kill eighteen is a way to

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,430
in stones Lake who beats so

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,649
I'm together to provide an overview of
what happened was 50 so underrated the

12
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,390
bus your

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,050
what features did we are not what
performance improvements did we are

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,620
chillin

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,980
what usability improvements we made and
what

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,690
entertaining stories we can tell from
that experience

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,920
also where did we say your whale because
sometimes we fail

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,549
well are we still aiming to improve so
please

19
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,150
welcome Chris and John Cale

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,860
them

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,570
below you're hearing

22
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,539
fineman ago

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,430
so hello everyone I'm I was just
introduce I'm Jakarta pasqua to

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,310
this is Chris Lord her boat by Fox
platform engineers

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,700
working mostly on Firefox for Android I

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,130
wanna find a sweep ports Twitter very
regularly

27
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,310
and we hang out in a while channel on
was a lot higher see

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,360
so

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,509
when I was preparing to stalk I took
last year slights cuz I wanna

30
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,080
have some idea what to talk about and i
notice that's actually lost year we

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,039
already gave

32
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,520
quite an extensive presentation what we
would do in the future

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,610
so I didn't have so much to talk about
this year any government last year

34
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,470
but I was a bit lazy and I just will be
based at the slides from last year

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,390
an hour and I went to demand I source
correct that's what happened and

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,268
what didn't happen so

37
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,489
first thing at the start page missus
when you start up Firefox the first

38
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,690
thing you see it's important and report

39
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,810
for defecation so it's important to get
it right last year

40
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,980
we were planning to resign its website
few nice Firefox logo

41
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,690
and some ability to added stuff on there
or like lock top sites in place

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,510
so what we

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,030
and that the developing actually at some
point it looks pretty much like

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,320
the thing you see on the right but he
already iterative once because as I said

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,120
it's important

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,700
most important part of the application
so really want to get it right

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,910
so we we did something that's a bit more
closer to the

48
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,250
hollow design guidelines from Android
you get rid of the Firefox logo because

49
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,000
even though it looks pretty if actually
doing anything and there's

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,840
not all that much screen real estate on
the phone and

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,950
aside from the top sites few we also
have after several

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,290
amateur out to column perhaps but use
for you can swipe in between and go

53
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,819
between your

54
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,238
topside sure bookmark your history or
your reading list

55
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,290
ok

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,269
so that's a contamination can at the end
in sight like before solve it

57
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,269
you also wanna people to like open taps
and open stuff in new private that

58
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:40,250
biven grossing I we planned this last
year we more or less implemented it

59
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,900
exactly as designed to the screenshot us
to actual

60
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,459
in in Firefox for Android the private
but miss burke perfect app multi conduct

61
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,269
operates I'm really separate window

62
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,480
in terms of of usability on the phone at
this

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,738
this works a bit better where some
desktop having a private when I was a

64
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:57,650
bit more clear

65
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,470
new types you I

66
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,870
so we we change the way you never get
ripped abs

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,239
this is a screenshot of a 7-inch tablet
actually really have a

68
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,879
horizontal strip with the the male
sexual the current

69
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,899
sites there a looter one thing which are
still working on issue you can see the

70
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,179
icons in the bar on the top with the
selection

71
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,840
left once the regular perhaps the middle
once the the private abt and write one

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,219
armed attacks that are seeing from your
other devices

73
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,919
we're still not entirely clear on this
one we

74
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,359
at some point actually try putting
extender to make it clearer what does

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,460
different things are

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,489
with that turns out to be a real
nightmare when you try to

77
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,940
internationalize it gives

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,260
so languages have like really long works
and then that doesn't fit on the screen

79
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,979
anymore

80
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,550
so we went back to arkansas although I'm
not saying this is

81
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,380
to but finished swimming or keep going
so

82
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,219
that's what we were planning to do
that's what we ended up doing as you can

83
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,789
see that's a pretty close match

84
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,890
on the phone a.m. it's a bit different

85
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,849
or again you too limitations of the 0
you mostly use opponent forces for

86
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:06,479
example

87
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,820
it's a generally smaller resolution to
me actually use more room to

88
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,960
to show you two different app senator
vertical few

89
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,750
on a tablet

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,210
some we actually postponed doing a lot
of work for the tablet

91
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,940
you why last year we we just me that the
tablet to I S one of the latest thing so

92
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,070
we didn't think it was asked needed for

93
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,080
fairly happy what we have on their I
think only like to suffer for private

94
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,169
absence was added and tweaked a little
bit

95
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,919
but it still generally more or less the
same what thing we did was to make the

96
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,440
tabs over slide open and close by
automatically

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,159
but that turns out that not everyone
likes that we so we still have to act

98
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,279
like some way to lock that in place for
two to make that

99
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,360
customizable faults

100
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,690
so on a mobile device well most happy
just like specify oh I don't have a

101
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,110
separate folder salsa reformed some

102
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,250
specifically say that they won't
specific fault

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,450
not all of them do and if a fault has a

104
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,649
just to generate request to use a
reformed third are some

105
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:17,330
opportunities there we be found at some
mobile devices have fun

106
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,919
are modified by the vendor to have a bit
more unicode support because a

107
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,680
selling more countries or I wanna better
support some countries

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,140
and in some cases those phones half-life
broken for metrics

109
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,830
was also bit of movement on the web to
like

110
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,890
start including your own faults in your
web page and we decided last year

111
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,740
already that

112
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,020
we wanted to but also made some good
more all swift Firefox run right

113
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,089
there are really work well on a mobile
device on the small

114
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:48,229
high DPI screen and your originally
planning to use open Psalms

115
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,529
which is was made by Google for more or
less that purpose

116
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,300
but actually during the year a Intel
came out with their own fault which was

117
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,580
clear songs

118
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,080
and we evaluated them them carefully
and/or conclusion was that clear souls

119
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,140
is actually better than open songs so we
didn't end up burning open songs between

120
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,810
ship

121
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,640
clear Songz on it's probably not gonna
be very clear

122
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,700
on this projection because it's it's a
very big fewer risks for to reopen my

123
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,270
for small screens

124
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,469
I'm still not sure if my slice will come
out that well but you can

125
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,940
probably already see a bit here I'm that

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,260
for example the open songs tera in
increasing boldness

127
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I like the only difference is he really
is that loss on this very bold and the

128
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,399
other two have almost no differences

129
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,539
worsened clear Songz arm it's that
slightly better also

130
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,830
I have to say on the projector it
doesn't really come out as well i tre

131
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,649
and another a since say reform tax
credit for Shari

132
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,950
ICL we also found that was a really good
formed which have a license I was usable

133
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,950
for us

134
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,440
so for example to the Google homepage
left is the

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,870
default view right as the view with a.m.

136
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,080
lapierre Songz I am again that

137
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,690
doesn't really come out that problem a
projector bit reality if you would try

138
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,279
this on your phone you would see at

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,620
the right page it's way more readable
and in my opinion the form also slightly

140
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,789
more playful

141
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,180
to desist read a remote from again you
can see the difference

142
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,240
a little bit better I'm I hear it's even
better I think

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,570
yeah so the right she was a the new
reader motor where you can actually now

144
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,599
switch between the

145
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,669
survey for the Sun surf on we shouldn't
allow before

146
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:34,819
left this whole the you sleep before

147
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,370
so again on the phone you should find
that this a slightly more readable and

148
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:38,820
looks

149
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,330
by the better open web app so I think
the loft talk

150
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,660
sort of island to do this so we want it
integrates the

151
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,860
Firefox marketplace into Firefox for
Android here's

152
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,700
how it looks right now I'm so you can
just click on their

153
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,399
the application or less it is a free app
so good just click on message me install

154
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,170
it

155
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,300
and then you get a real nice icon on
your desktop so you just click on your

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:11,229
I'm your phone home page and you
launched a web app seamlessly

157
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,620
but work EC I'm you might wonder why
this is coming back

158
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,649
lost year full-time somebody already
them out

159
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,060
Robert she call from the phone to the
browser

160
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,390
but almost leaders some difference
between a demo where you have like a

161
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,790
you know exactly which phone you're
using your you know the

162
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,680
application you're working with and

163
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,160
and where is in reality we made robert
is he so people could build

164
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,260
everything and have it work on every
possible phone source quite a bit of

165
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,640
work to do to stabilize everything

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,510
it supports robert is he on every phone
worry support Firefox which mean going

167
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,300
back to Android 2.2

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,390
an reality is that

169
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,380
Android didn't get all there right if
the ice to make this work perfectly

170
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,689
until Android 4.2 I'm it's probably
going to work quite well starting from

171
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,160
Ice Cream Sandwich bit

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,370
a.m. your experience may vary depending
on the exact device you have

173
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,920
that it's another slight I am

174
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,529
so ever dishes also still a bit of an
evolving standards in this picture was

175
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,470
taken when I was in Boston

176
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,950
for remembered she meeting at I think
the worst possible time because they got

177
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,880
like a battle

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,339
where snow storm in 50 years and I got
stuck there

179
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:29,350
an you might be wondering what's wrong
with this picture

180
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,339
well as it turns out that you can
actually captured are all

181
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,820
image data from an Android phone but all
those phones or

182
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,320
AC almost all phones have the have a
camera dated sideways

183
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,029
an as it turns out there's no way from
within and words to rate rotate the

184
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,050
image the right way

185
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,219
what every Android application bus is

186
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,290
actually just swap it back on display
but if you're

187
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,410
you wanna send the video image
preferrably without converting it

188
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,060
twenty times to remote client which may
be running Chrome that's not really an

189
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,839
option

190
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,580
so we had to fix to settle i'll and what
happened here is that

191
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,830
with her apparently didn't do this and
then this happens but maybe I so

192
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,560
we have big plans to implement a lot of
stuff I'm that some worry

193
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,319
I wouldn't say completely fail but it
didn't really go as planned

194
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,420
want to implement the gamepad API hasn't
happened

195
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,209
I don't really find any good reason why
that didn't happen so my conclusion is

196
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,270
that nobody it was a lot like schemes or

197
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,449
doesn't play games or anything telephony

198
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,839
we could have done that but the Android
permissions mobile right now is that we

199
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:35,610
must request

200
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,760
every permission that we could possibly
need

201
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,260
at the moment you install your phone and
that really conflicts with mazzola being

202
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,750
a privacy conscious

203
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,579
company because if you wouldn't want to
implement a lot from you guys

204
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,390
than Firefox the moment you would have
to install could have to refresh like

205
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,990
basically every permission imaginable
including quite a few that are

206
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,110
but our user base would go up notes over
I think

207
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,760
it's rainy bath with separate issue that
P also progression to like take pictures

208
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,520
and people were like why does Firefox
have to take pictures

209
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,060
push notifications as it turns out
that's that's like more useful for

210
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,579
affecting Firefox OS

211
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,410
I from

212
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,370
than it is on Android and I think the
specification also didn't finish in time

213
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:26,150
alright Chris your turn that

214
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,030
and again from so this is something I
think I presented last the end said

215
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,829
it was coming soon anything im one short
year later and have 70 80 bucks and be

216
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,630
happy in

217
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,260
pictures a bit I I was a fun time this
the

218
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,230
the feature as you can see I know the UI
guess that you always meant to be a

219
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,000
distraction for you I say

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,560
lets you concentrate more on the the
content of the page

221
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,280
and we're now working on the feature to
return of is also a

222
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,459
that becoming saying might be a bit
sooner than it take to implement the

223
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,210
first place

224
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,250
bomb so

225
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,650
we now I I think we present in this last
year as well we have we were doing

226
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,730
nightly builds for

227
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,160
x86 devices we now that's trickle down
into the Google Play Store now so you

228
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,770
can run Firefox release

229
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,650
on kinda wanna that two or three x86
Android devices are available so if

230
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,459
you've kinda

231
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,540
mistakenly bought one of those then
we've got your back

232
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,969
its as over

233
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,000
the camber sick we kind of did a lot of
we wanted to make it work well for game

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,540
so we did a lot of optimization work say
one other big changes that we made last

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,620
year was a

236
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,530
he switched from the back and render
using Cairo teasing skier

237
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,880
which alan was quite a speedup but on
top of that

238
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,300
I we now have hardware section so in

239
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,920
kinda selected cases mice in the kind of
cases that games use

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,099
your have J Alexander to campus as a
poster softer and canvas and thats

241
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,920
and it brings us closer at least a
parity with say chrome and other WebKit

242
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,459
based Android browsers

243
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,480
and meals inmates them

244
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,570
improvements with the way with Joe gets
to the screen

245
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,390
as and this given its choir or API does
not prohibit Rican

246
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,120
due to optimize it but I am I think now
we should be should kinda be

247
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,350
pretty much top of class when it comes
to web J lapsed in

248
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,120
performance saying you basically at that
point like we have the minimal

249
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
kind of get to screen reads and then
Minister kinda down to JS performance

250
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,800
where

251
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,089
but pretty good so

252
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,370
low precision rendering was a feature
mainly for low-end Android phones

253
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,410
I am say gives us the option where
basically if we fall behind on rendering

254
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,209
say

255
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,410
you have a sleigh phone or there's a
site that takes particularly slow path

256
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,839
through our code or something

257
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,070
am we can temporarily sacrifice
rendering resolution

258
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,240
and then get better rendering speed so
the idea is that you never

259
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,450
going to see nothing when you scroll
down the page this kind of

260
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,440
you might see a lower resolution
rendering for a short period and we

261
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,930
quickly catch up in rendering
high-resolution

262
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,849
as but as many for low-end devices
ideally you'll never see this feature

263
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,950
but you probably will this is a

264
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,740
I N maybe addition the palestine slight
kinda thing but have the render

265
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,420
now in high color by the Fort Payne the
Android

266
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,990
ecosystem or the device ecosystem rather
changed quite dramatically over the last

267
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,420
year so whereas

268
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,560
last year's pretty common for Android
sign it can admit to low-end devices to

269
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
have not so much RAM

270
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,689
maybe not such a great screen say you
might not even have a screen that can

271
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,130
display 24-bit color

272
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,650
nevermind having a around actually
render a page but I am

273
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,459
that's completely different now most
finds even the lowest and defines now

274
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,310
you have certainly you've got a high
color screen got a pretty reasonable

275
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,270
screen as well and you've got enough RAM

276
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,270
the commander and Michaela by default so
when

277
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,280
when harder allows us to be D and if you
don't like that you can switch it back

278
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,530
in about conflict as well

279
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,329
exited difference

280
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,200
can well you can barely see the
difference there but take if you're on

281
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,860
the screen is pretty dramatic like it
can be quite dramatic in certain cases

282
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,940
usually but as color gradients back to
jim Kerr

283
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,010
back on

284
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,689
123 alright so

285
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,829
yeah I don't arm 21 problem we have a
limo by Alice I we don't support

286
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,359
tool to like traditional Facebook
add-ons which is cool to having you I

287
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,600
won't work on Firefox friendly because
when you stop up for

288
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,250
and rejoice and we have a possibility
now already

289
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,860
to include a of our class file with your

290
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,510
add-on unfortunately we didn't really
get to like defining

291
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,900
if the ice to hook into are you I which
means if you try to use this you would

292
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,089
have to use reflection and probably
everything will break

293
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,640
a as soon as we change something in our
you eye so this

294
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,929
I would say largely unfinished you can
use your offer some things but

295
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:12,860
I think we really have some work to do
there and it's really usable

296
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,188
and songs minor and less minor features
you had it

297
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,390
I'm it's a 6-4 decoding using your

298
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,160
devices decoder if you're in fortune of
to use but on that stuff

299
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,240
a application not responding reporter
what well

300
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,850
if Firefox crash us we will know about
it if Firefox hangs

301
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,600
me didn't know about it so we built
something that allows us to track

302
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,668
if the process just got stuck instead of
really crashing

303
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:40,810
Firefox health report I'm basically I
did you do it

304
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,928
idea there is stuff we track some
performance stuff and I'm

305
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,520
if we see something that's a problem for
user stand we can respond to it or even

306
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,929
like

307
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,360
or pop into our user Sat day to have a
problem and that they can get a better

308
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,449
performance by fixing it

309
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,679
be finished all the back and parts of
that but you I of particles health

310
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,000
report and finished

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,320
this is actually really burning us right
now because Adblock Plus

312
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,649
is sorta broken on mobile and takes like
10 seconds to start up

313
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,360
everybody started to complain likewise
Firefox for Android so slow but that's

314
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
actually have block

315
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,149
and if this would have been finished we
we've been able to tell those people

316
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,360
bit it isn't so you have a bit of a
problem there

317
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,620
reader mode improvements I talk a little
bit about touch up some more options you

318
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,969
can change the forms

319
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,040
search in you I you can change the
default search engine and stuff like

320
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,659
that

321
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,160
picture else show a picture of that upon
your support as ingest support on ARM

322
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,810
content warnings law

323
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,070
picture so if you will quickly wanna
share a web page

324
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,389
a or actually some text with someone
else there's the

325
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,240
right button which allows you to select
everything on your device up a share

326
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,950
intent

327
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,570
and it remembers the lost funds in my
case I sent something to Dropbox

328
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,530
and I gotta drop box I candor

329
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,160
just browsing so you have a tablet and
but you cover you have a friend that

330
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,380
your home and he quickly long

331
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,679
wants look something up so you can go
into menu go to

332
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,160
new guest session and hand it to them
and then they can browse all they want

333
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,210
they don't have access to your history
doctor and the moment

334
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,620
the relief guess to mode and also their
stuff disappears

335
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,709
okay coming soon so what's planned for
next year or what this

336
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,919
sort of now arriving and a stable
versions of Firefox

337
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,950
the great fabric on rewrite I'm

338
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,600
so for new contributors the we can to
keep books apart which she called with

339
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,439
first box or mentor box

340
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,490
which are we think our real reasonably
easy to tackle without

341
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,850
in-depth understanding of how all
Firefox works

342
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,379
we also indicate liked this is a person
that was a lot we can actively help you

343
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,050
with this book

344
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,490
and you need to know this and this
language to work on it

345
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,770
I'm in this what's one of those books
whose star like that I think

346
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,210
and we had in turn over the summer route
took this as his first assignment

347
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,000
so the problem we had was that we
noticed that sometimes she would get

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,440
no fabric on or really crappy looking
traffic on

349
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,910
when grossing and will use particles a
lot and they're by prominent in you I

350
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,740
that's a problem so this in turn started
looking at that and after a while he

351
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,560
came back

352
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,389
am it turns out technically the problem
lost abt

353
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,500
although Android an officially supports
adult ICO file the coding

354
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,610
which is a majority of Africans out
there it's only supports

355
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,469
home sub for much there and get only to
coach the first one

356
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,740
so thats explanation why we would get
the wrong target on sometimes

357
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,640
so this in turn as part of this
internship private ended up writing and

358
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,100
IC recorder in Java

359
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,520
which i think is a very nice thing you
can do without

360
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,770
having to know too much about Firefox me

361
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,158
then when he was finished he came back
to sunset you guys suck

362
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm I looked at all the fabric on code
and and Firefox runner dancer parable

363
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,100
math

364
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,639
like everything's converting from one
format to the other

365
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,470
I'll I mean everybody just gets

366
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,480
ad hoc things while working on it and he
wrote all the public on coat

367
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,190
so that which would work a lot better
lot foster got nine high resolution

368
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,760
icons

369
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,600
if there's not a high-resolution item
like exponents by determining

370
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,189
the dominant colour oh I've been looking
at the slight likewise

371
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,940
Google having a small icon so me might
still have some boxer

372
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,850
over scroll we use to if you like a
swipe for a cookie while scrolling would

373
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,439
like bounce along back

374
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,020
and well at some point realize that sir
a diesel engine make which is annoying

375
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,149
after a while

376
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,570
so we got rid of it and I'll just just a
small blue gradient

377
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,780
that this place a few at the beach

378
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,168
tax election day however we cleanup you
I a bit

379
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,070
summer options also share and some small
tweaks like issue with breasts in the

380
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,939
white space at the bottom of the page

381
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,210
or person to Firefox would just like
randomly select some

382
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,130
text on a different part of the page
worse now we don't do anything

383
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,960
that's all small tweaks which made
application easier to use

384
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,830
pipe collar yeah song to meet some of my
support for we display some you are now

385
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,300
we didn't do before gecko view

386
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,000
that's actually and fairly important
from the muzzle a perspective

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,710
so at some point during Firefox
development 3 if upon making

388
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,870
echoed rendering engine compatible to be
able to it falls faster

389
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,158
but this member was really really
difficult for anyone but miss a lot to

390
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,350
use gecko in their project

391
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,760
and WebKit gain and gobbled up that
entire market and also

392
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,760
nobody read but does this really able to
make a Firefox you I

393
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,860
right now and this is a problem on

394
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,270
on Android so we're doing a lot of
effort to make a

395
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,510
growing battle against your ad that's
all this weird calls are you I is

396
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,310
completely separate from

397
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,649
from the engine parts and we hope that
this

398
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:55,850
first makes it easy for people to him
that the modern HM 05

399
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,050
engine even on a book and applications
even after running over

400
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,389
Android phones but also to like
experiment with some new UI stuff

401
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,899
even breathing a bit on like making a
Firefox that's more usable for

402
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:10,860
for children and the Reno to support the
community I would be interested

403
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,120
Firefox that's like really privacy
focused include store by default

404
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,389
I'm I'm not saying you're going to do
this but the hope is that gecko view

405
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,970
makes this more people for someone to
actually do

406
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,570
a other features a BK centers are so I
showed you that well perhaps

407
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,310
at this I can ping but if you would go
into applications on your Android device

408
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,580
you wouldn't see the web app because
it's not a real Android application

409
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,610
be made it so that Firefox actually
generate maybe K install sack

410
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,610
and it's a completely seamless
experience compared to an aid to fap

411
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,620
partial to construct the new sink stuff
from

412
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,239
risk and change them somewhat
complicated for most people

413
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,149
from think accounts with her regular
using the impulse working system

414
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:56,199
back streaming that celebrity she
feature basically

415
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,970
and self using your camera you can also
use a top as if it is short

416
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,620
source and I'm show someone what you're
looking at on your phone

417
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,620
and Bigg ass because we currently don't
have it on Firefox for Android

418
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,570
so something the graphics team a working
on at the moment

419
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,610
is kind of consolidating the rendering
code so

420
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,600
some the code that we introduced make
and program the faster like

421
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,070
tiled rendering and my position and ring
and so on

422
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,129
we're trying to say get that used in
other platforms a Firefox OS and Windows

423
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,730
and part of that work is not just making
the code werken as other platforms but I

424
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,169
ding

425
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:38,880
up in optimizing its a under its going
to benefit from a

426
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
wheels a handsome Android specific work
in the pipeline as well say

427
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,020
in Android kick out there are some new
API's let us

428
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,980
let us render to texture faster say
we're going to be using those in

429
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,120
idea hopefully in the not too far future
you'll see some rendering speed ups

430
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,668
impulse a reason the Mason page loads
speedups

431
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,550
mainly from a.m. we had a quite
inefficient

432
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,690
I S loading spinner render a and the for
placing

433
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,659
per replace at the loading bar which is
in some cases especially for older

434
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,490
devices quite dramatically

435
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,370
improved page late speech which is kinda
surprising

436
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,250
and birmingham police other features
that were here we've done as well

437
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,610
more gestures update download match a
better form fitting and so on

438
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,250
and that's it and I think about times
Albert

439
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,020
make we got time for a question

440
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,610
one questions if anyone has a fantastic
question

441
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:41,610
now's the time I get as much as a
fantastic question over there

442
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,760
well we'll be done with it last year so
I'm

443
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,908
rather not do this again also the
question is can we don't know about EC

444
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:53,919
in Avignon threes

445
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,850
not really right now

446
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,908
on maybe normal one more

447
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:06,020
loss on

448
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:12,389
the question was how much Java credibly
writing for a for the whole browser

449
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:16,810
to how Android dependent is like

450
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,879
than Nevis I am new graphics features

451
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,570
on it's a line is: in terms of how it
works is we have gecko

452
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,060
which is all native code pretty much and
