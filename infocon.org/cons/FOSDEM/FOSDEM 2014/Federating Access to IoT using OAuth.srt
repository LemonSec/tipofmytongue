1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:07,340
if you yes and I to present my my old
friend Paul Fremantle is going to talk

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,489
about security

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,340
on into things meeting PhD currently in
this in this issue of

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,240
W wso2 so Paul

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,119
thanks very much

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,140
me too much time working

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,250
and just

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,690
my have to try and go so arm

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,010
hi I'm and Paul and I'm I'm a keen
supporter

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,269
the concept to federated identity so
who've you use

11
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,370
a war or I was too excellent rights so
that would make my life a lot easier

12
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,940
today so arm what I'm gonna do is
firstly just talk a little bit about

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,820
federated identity access management

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,610
that's me very quick because love you
know about that arm

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,039
and and a little bit about I was too I'm
gonna talk a very

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,309
briefly about MQT team to the protocol
have been using it's a lightweight

17
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,518
messaging protocol

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,890
this designed around I O T Scott other
kinda devices

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,240
and then I'm gonna put the two together
hopefully with this out we know

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,990
arm its the demo is broken three times
this morning already

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,939
so if it actually works I will be very
happy indeed buy me a beer afterwards

22
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,179
and then I'll talk about lessons learned
next steps

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,439
so Federation

24
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,559
is is important and and it's very
important for security

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,909
calls the the big problem we've had with
security

26
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,229
on the Internet has been centralized
security

27
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,340
where firstly people have failures

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,060
and secondly it's not in your control
and

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,549
the um especially as the

30
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,659
number of users on the internet has
grown massively

31
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,890
basically people had to move to
federated models

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,820
and that's why I was too has been so
popular I see the same challenge with

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,380
I O two devices which is that they all

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,030
they're all billions have them already
their growing very rapidly

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,220
we can expect them to you centralized
traditional

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,370
user ID password type security models
the just don't go to work

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,200
scale sickly and federated identity
access management really important

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,708
because it allows you to retain control
of your

39
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,200
password a new side known for sure the
way most people use this is that they

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,609
give it to Facebook instead

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,629
ok Google and and they trust them

42
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,720
and of course that itself is a challenge
but the the point is that if you give it

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,230
to someone who you do trust

44
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,970
then they don't handed out to anyone
else

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,280
and this is this came about a I was came
about

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,550
specifically from problems like LinkedIn
saying give me your gmail user ID

47
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,330
password

48
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,390
I'll go and grab your your contact list
in a promise not to send any emails not

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,399
to do anything else

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,590
and actually that currently facing a
lawsuit in the US

51
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,260
saying that they did more than they said
they would so I was to basically says

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,159
it's up to me

53
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,329
to to give a token or to authorize a
token

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,010
for LinkedIn to say how much they can
access what what they can do

55
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,149
and how long that lasts and that's also
very important arm

56
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,860
and and oath to is is a very seems to be

57
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,989
the most-used federated protocol its use
by gephardt

58
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,209
its use by LinkedIn Gmail Facebook and
and many many others

59
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,819
so it seems to be a good good approach
at least

60
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,220
to start using and

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,080
really why federated in identity access
management

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,110
I O T well the the most important thing

63
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,970
from my perspective is your device it
ought to be your data

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,040
you know to be under your control

65
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,859
where you publish updates who can access
it how they can access

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,080
if my house is connected to the Internet

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,159
maybe I want to let my

68
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,239
you know my neighbors check on the
health

69
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,250
that while I'm away but only while I'm
away I don't want anybody else coming

70
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,569
along and saying hey the

71
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,730
lights have been on nobody's been living
there for week

72
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,570
got bud so it's very important that

73
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,430
that you can have control over your data
and I think that's been a big failure

74
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,320
in you know it. devices so far because a
lot of people hungry thought about it

75
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,479
been a big failure on the Internet
overall

76
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,770
something that was slowly fixing another

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,479
reason a very technical reasons the
tokens are much better model

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,969
for managing identity in a in a device

79
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,410
so most server to server communications
these days at the edges on properly

80
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,910
rely on tokens because the token is user
ID password is for personal

81
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,620
for device and another thing that that
depends on you of implementation but

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,720
you can potentially manage that the
tokens in the scopes quite well

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,270
so you can in in bed that token in a
device

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,698
and then manager overtime

85
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,740
so how'd it opens work while the basic
idea is

86
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,199
you you get a token and you then passed
just the token to the resource

87
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,250
so this to keep RTC RTP

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,560
identity provider and the resource
resolve server is what's trying to

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,919
are you're trying to access resources oh
no you was trying to get access to your

90
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:27,990
resources

91
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,160
and the IDPs the authentication 7 this
case or the authorizations

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,419
and so as I said

93
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,530
I was too is very widely implemented i
think is pretty good

94
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,809
there are people who to have criticisms
particularly over the concept to the

95
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,110
parrot ok

96
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,250
which is basically if you have this
token you all

97
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,979
you have full control so obviously the
stealing a ferret opens is an issue

98
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,380
that's a very big issue in IT devices
I'll talk about that at the end

99
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,990
um course there's never any certainty
with

100
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,410
with security protocols the only
certainty is that hasn't broken yet

101
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,520
there is some researchers who've done a
model a bit using a framework from MIT

102
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,979
alloy and they've done some formal
modeling for was to

103
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,620
so that gives you some more security it
isn't just used to the cheats be there

104
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,360
is a

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,880
a draft spec for using with fossil so
basically

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,050
lying to log on the sauce so is it's
getting some traction outside the GDP

107
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,080
this is a three legged delors I'm gonna

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,180
so talk through this in the demo more
arm but

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,340
but it up but the slides up on on the
web of twins and

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,979
a few more details you can grab those so
I'm also briefly gonna talk about mpg T

111
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,340
who's used MQT for a curfew

112
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,948
to the north singed same cutie in fact
probably

113
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,319
okay so the male citizens who's got
facebook Messenger on their

114
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,009
fun okay so more views than cutie

115
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,090
you just don't know um Inc ATT's
protocol

116
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,770
that came out of IBM but not

117
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,979
a I have one guy in IBM happens not to
be your typical IBM

118
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,370
arm so it's not your normal I been
standard it's very very lightweight very

119
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,729
simple

120
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,659
and doesn't you know and and just does
what what it needs to

121
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,050
and it was originally designed for a
pipeline in Alaska

122
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,120
this pipeline monitoring guys came to

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,690
IBM and they said got MQ Series in on
you know

124
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,949
system that we want to connect are
monitoring

125
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,280
think stations on the pipeline to our
Inc you serious system so we can

126
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,090
we can follow the flow of the oil and so
some IBM go sell a ticket with

127
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,960
MQ Series on the motion stations and and
they were like well

128
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,698
as a 1400 bites hedda with MQ Series

129
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,220
and each extra bite casa 78,000

130
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,879
dollars day because we're going to a
satellite

131
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,949
this is about 15 years ago very very
expensive

132
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,710
so they were like no I don't think we
can do that so basically designed

133
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,818
approach called the true but had a and

134
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,360
that the best thing that's happened to
MQT is its recently

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,120
really the a lot of it has moved to
eclipse so there's a number of projects

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
in the clips

137
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,940
in the m2m a group that around creating

138
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,120
open source brokers there's a a sea bass

139
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,360
to sea bass brokers 12 Larsen B one
mosquito

140
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,389
a new one from job was just about to be
donated

141
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,010
lots and lots of clients in different
languages and other clients another

142
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,429
things as well is also being
standardized by Oasis

143
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,189
some people have had defied expenses
about but basically that's just gone

144
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,690
through with some very minor
clarifications

145
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,140
updates I think pretty good process that

146
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,680
there's also a lightweight version for
ZigBee called MQT TSN

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,719
I'm not gonna go into that but that's a
actually very nice

148
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,510
practical as well is a sort of flow

149
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,589
this is a a full reliable flow which
basically counties each message gets to

150
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,149
each subscriber exactly once

151
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,750
which is why it's quite heavy this basis
320 she's a service you can say

152
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,209
no reliability this message may may not
get there

153
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,859
a it will definitely get there but it
may get them more than once

154
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,310
choice one and this is it will get there
exactly once

155
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,699
so that requires this or the country now
the Arduino and QTc lot

156
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,830
client can only do QS xerox has no
reliability

157
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,740
but you can bridge that into a broker
and then have broke up

158
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,480
to high levels district

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,930
so um in my demo

160
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,069
what I'm gonna do is ongoing embed and I
will Stoke on

161
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,760
on him now actually with tokens this two
different things this

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,860
the access token which knows the parrot
ok and there's a refreshed ok

163
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,990
next token typically times out and and
so you normally have to go and say well

164
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,810
let's find out

165
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,268
I'm gonna go with my refresh token back
to the server

166
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,300
the main I DP and gets

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,810
a new version ok now the problem is
that's an HTTP call now I don't have

168
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,199
enough Rome

169
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,040
on my Arduino for the HTTP and in Qt
libraries and the actual

170
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,949
job I want to do which is a which is %uh
gotta

171
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,329
little accelerometer on here and i won
publish information

172
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,699
so have an i2c library so

173
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,310
what I did was I basically said okay
we'll want one option basically to make

174
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,560
a

175
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,360
access to with a very very long lifetime
and in bed that onto the

176
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,519
but thats some firstly

177
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,410
is up to the awards provide you're
providing so that's not actually going

178
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,000
to work

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
if you want to make this generic and
work with any award

180
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,390
so what I did was I created a new
component called the refresher

181
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,760
which basically transferring HDP thing
into cutie

182
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,819
so I at the start I'm gonna I'm go

183
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,190
Tendulkar invalid there a token

184
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm gonna try its gonna fail so then I'm
publish

185
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,459
onto that on two different topic a
refresh token

186
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,479
and get back to Turkey need then the o2
is good disconnect

187
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,750
reconnect New York system so it's a
little bit

188
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,670
faked to demonstrate this process that
normally would happen you know once a

189
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,630
day

190
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,000
or something but I'm gonna make sure
happens every time

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,160
and then its gonna publish that

192
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,089
to the to the broker and the broker has
a plugin

193
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,079
a roach in Python which uses arm which
basically makes a call

194
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,899
just on the call the award Inspection
HPI which is a restful call into the ID

195
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:41,970
P to say what's

196
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,100
go does this token

197
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,060
the scope is basically the access
control so annoying coated the scope is

198
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,189
a bit Jason

199
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,529
saying you can read or write to this set
up to topics

200
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,189
so that's a that's how Inc scoping

201
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,529
so then that the old we know they city
tries to publish a particular topic

202
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,730
and the server saying does this user
have does this

203
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,220
this device have the credential in there
are also other subscriber

204
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,529
that's going to also use the same
mechanism

205
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,149
to get its subscription and and
basically pulled a tooth

206
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,860
all-clear any questions it will become a
little bit clearer with the dome

207
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,970
is not a beautiful graphic demo like the
first one

208
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,019
I was very impressed by but also

209
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,750
you know that will change my mind this
is all a buncha back moments

210
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm using all is open source this bit is
just a hack

211
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
basically the is a I will survey here
which is

212
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,010
which is from my company but it's open
pure Apache open source

213
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,769
arm a there is a a sort of a pseudo
standard

214
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,769
introspection API for getting the scope

215
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,380
from here but we don't implement yet
we're gonna had it so have a

216
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,060
just have something that's that's

217
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,130
that's just transferring I could make
the the soap calling here that this

218
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,870
offers but I really likes open it and
we'll have to do so

219
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,279
from mice and so I abridged out into the
standard

220
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,600
column is going to be in the next
release the south side

221
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
that's a sort of hack but apart from
that and this

222
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,630
API here is we're number one is coming
in is completely standard that specified

223
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,680
will speck really I think your spec
should

224
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,569
specify this one as well arm and for
some reason the standardization at this

225
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,420
in the IT office coastal

226
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,849
again because this is a useful

227
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,870
API to say give me toca now let me know

228
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,980
what lifetime that token is what the sky
but this insightful

229
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,370
which is what this needs for some reason
that sorta

230
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,060
seen as behind the scenes by the old
guys

231
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,010
so the a night because if the the way
this is

232
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,470
failed so many times today I'm gonna a I
see but most one stop spinning a show

233
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,470
you I'm just not gonna completed

234
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,810
so the first step would be basically
when you create your device

235
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,050
so you need to to talk push that refresh
token into here

236
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,510
so the first thing I do is a go to a

237
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,819
window here and I

238
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,829
have a little from a little

239
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:23,630
create tokens script

240
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,889
and this basically just

241
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,510
does a redirected to my ID

242
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,850
so this is a redirect to the ID P saying
this is where the resource services

243
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,100
on I'm not this is my job I'm gonna hand
you over to the

244
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,389
to the I will serve us this is like when
you go to Facebook and it says do you

245
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,410
want to give this up

246
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,959
permission to do this so

247
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,430
and and I don't have a SSL certificate
on here so it's basically saying it's

248
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,388
not just

249
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,570
so this is now you have to login and say
who you are

250
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,910
that's given permission to this so I put
in my credentials

251
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,620
and use seems

252
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,690
and bingo and then it says

253
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,820
a and then that scope should really be
some meaningful statement

254
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,240
do you want to publish John to allow
this device to publish to your topic

255
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,269
which should be what it say are I'm I've

256
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,959
gotta in a sort of II I've got to Jason
string and there was some

257
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,750
problems with the way Jason stored
because its space

258
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,920
to limited scopes you know of so i buy
64 encoded by jasons

259
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,040
it's not over useful but but it gives
you the idea so that

260
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,250
obscure strengths is gets his paw
permission to

261
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,529
to publish to this particular topic

262
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,519
and then I'm I'm gonna for businesses
need a break those

263
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,980
demo so then i get some token

264
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,550
refraction barreto consider the lifetime
they now have to be

265
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,339
sucked into my Arduino are I'm gonna
avoid that for the moment

266
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,250
and if it fails and tried again so I'm
hoping that the

267
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,040
the that's why use two different ID
because I'm hoping that I haven't

268
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,269
overwritten the tokens and

269
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,160
complained about the water so have some
tokens already written in here

270
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,730
and then I would and then basically

271
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,699
what's gonna happen now isn't it hola

272
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:28,250
one of my many windows which has got my
broken

273
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,350
so this is my mosquito broke a

274
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,120
with the extra bit of code in it next to
the code singles looking

275
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,829
and plugged in my Arduino and

276
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:45,829
it has means

277
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,870
it's not

278
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,870
instead

279
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:09,770
just

280
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,270
now

281
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,660
I was just somewhere else so what's
happening here

282
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,660
is that its basically the Arduino has
connected

283
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,659
and has tried to connect with

284
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,820
a to meet ok which is this zero one two
three four

285
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,659
that's my expired barreto and it's
failed

286
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,550
it go back a I'm you've got the wrong
credentials the Knights reconnected

287
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,560
are as with the with the deion really
this should be connected to different

288
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,379
broke at this point

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,530
this should be saying I'm gonna talk to
my DP

290
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,139
and connect and and get my

291
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,330
and refreshments hope I've kinda fudged
it by having it on the same brokerage

292
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,230
the resource

293
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,530
that's that's actually a big security
hole its easy fix

294
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,480
so then it's now

295
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,530
that there's a simple scripted called
refresher

296
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,000
which basically converts rain cutie
she's

297
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,130
takes that token and send it to the IDPA

298
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,680
and says here we go swat this refresh
token for real you access token

299
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,590
that republish it back on 10 cutie where
the client picks it up

300
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,720
disconnects and then it now reconnect to
that token

301
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,050
and as you can see I'm now getting

302
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,139
some data from my in

303
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,760
from my accelerometer here and the whole
thing

304
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,230
dies a little bit because a handgun in
cashing in here

305
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,020
so every single publishes doing it's
making it easy to be caught my eye was

306
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,550
server

307
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,669
arm and it's a

308
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,360
cruddy python script running in the
broker and I have a feeling it's

309
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,679
its not garbage collecting properly in
this a memory leak

310
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,480
and it's not working but because it's
literally doing you know thousands and

311
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,590
thousands in a shitty

312
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,760
requests against the South's other
searchlight that's easily fixed by

313
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,370
firstly

314
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,550
getting someone who I can actually write
code to do it and and secondly

315
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,659
arm putting some cashing in that which
is obvious because when you get back

316
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,820
that struck from the

317
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,210
introspection server such commitments
lights when it

318
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,900
gets this scope here it gets a lifetime
for that ok

319
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
so it can and so can I know that that
bowlers

320
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,830
that this holes Audrina is authorized to
publish for the next

321
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,100
sixty minutes so now I can cash that
year

322
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,149
so so

323
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,330
okay not not the most exciting demos but
I think would have demonstrated here

324
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,840
is firstly there are some tricky bits in
using a war

325
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,389
on such a small device it's not the
actual token that's easy that's just 24

326
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,980
1340 by character

327
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,140
but the Refresh little flow a is a paid

328
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,960
because you've got you've got whatever
your CEO apon QTc protocol

329
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,740
and then suddenly I meant to do an HTTP
request over somewhere else

330
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,620
the so by swapping it out using the same
protocol for both of those

331
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,820
I get rounds arm some interesting things
here so

332
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,960
lessons learnt well my MQT

333
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,480
an i2c Co took up ninety percent 7
percent to the memory on my

334
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,750
doing Miller so I really didn't have
room for the HTTP Live

335
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,000
as well arm in fact I had to cut out
some %uh the eye to seek out

336
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,420
to to actually get it all in arm

337
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,770
another big issue is that its

338
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,720
a huge security flaw sending this
refresh token access token

339
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
without some kind encryption so

340
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,280
and there's no TLS on on this Audrina so
I think that's something that we need to

341
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,560
solve is hard to do

342
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,210
encryption on the side that's a problem
for anything fun setting user ID and

343
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,140
password that's the Saints I don't feel

344
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,420
it's any worse with awards but it's
certainly a problem

345
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,450
is resolving in this scenario I would
assume that I've

346
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,230
gonna have to have some local security
to solve

347
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,740
or at least some WiFi security I'm using
a WiFi network

348
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,270
arm one other challenges here is that
the ole

349
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,350
implementations you know a role you know
they'll follow the spec for spec has

350
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,580
lotsa locations

351
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,189
and when you're in such a small device
those elections matter

352
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,110
so for example the refresh token can get
changed every time

353
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,729
it get every time you use it they can
get changed

354
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,100
now I think that's a problem in a device
like this because it's there's no

355
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,240
reliability

356
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,740
so it might send out a message saying
please change

357
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,850
my refresh token and then

358
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,780
a the network dies or goes for Tom or
something

359
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,540
and I never get the new refreshed ok now
the old ones dead

360
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,710
it's hard coat in the prom here have had
a chance updated how on earth do you get

361
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,440
the new refresh token

362
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,130
so there are some challenges with
different I will specs

363
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,640
and you need the right settings on those
implantations to

364
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,650
to suit so I want to make sure that I
have a very long lifetime I we first

365
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,840
token on this device which might not be
appropriate in a mobile phone was easy

366
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,560
to

367
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,210
get the person to login and reset it but
on a embedded devices heart

368
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,170
up I just that and its

369
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,630
arm so I think the other thing is that
some

370
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,250
hours its importations let you up take
the Speck

371
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,720
aside the scope foreign for token

372
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,550
but others don't a justice %um okay you
want a difference hope you're gonna

373
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,500
kill that token to do that login thing I
showed you again

374
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,940
course on an embedded devices network so

375
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,130
for those devices you need to build
update the scope without changing the

376
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,550
type

377
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,270
like so so I've got my devices in my
house and then suddenly

378
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,910
I have a software update me to do
something different published a

379
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,460
different topic or different

380
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,330
target I need to build update the scope
without changing the token

381
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,149
and I told you this was a bit of a
security flaw

382
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,900
the way that I have had it all going
through the resource over

383
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,710
which mind cutie brokering should've had
to brokers but that's not a big deal

384
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,050
one or the other challenges this is no
and kitties really appeal pops up

385
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,200
model says no well-defined way

386
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,150
say I just want to send this refresh
token back to just this device

387
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,410
so what I did was I basically created a
topic Araki such clients and the client

388
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,840
ID

389
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,679
and I a implanted a a custom security
role in my

390
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,960
in my security at on to say that only
this device can

391
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,050
can subscribe to that topic

392
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,760
sorry this device is gonna get that data
but I i feel that should at least be

393
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,530
a so there should be some kinda standard
model for that in maybe not in the spec

394
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,680
itself but

395
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,520
in the condo general way that people use
and QTc

396
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,960
so the next steps I want to do the same
thing for for the constrained

397
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,670
application protocol

398
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,720
or any other IT particles want arm

399
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,890
obviously I need to fix my
implementation it did work but

400
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,240
only just arm and I think this

401
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,410
that little flaw with MQT to deal with
COA p ought to be defined in the same

402
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,600
way that is for HTTP here's how you

403
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,129
to refresh on a different particle

404
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,390
are are if anyone's interested in this
or has any other ideas on on federated

405
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,070
things that should be used with it.
please contact me I'm

406
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,200
interested in collaborating orders
contact me

407
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,540
thank you very much any questions

408
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,480
actually have time for questions maybe
just one one question

409
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,480
gone my watched as we go two minutes

410
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,970
walk if your place they're doing a
letter to you you know there are some

411
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,150
device that actually can have memory and
CPU for

412
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,360
implement Inc US or proper
authentication is that the phone

413
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,899
so so I agree I mean I think that's
important but as far as I know there's

414
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,700
no TLS library

415
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,780
for any or do we know so I think that
needs to be written so if anyone wants

416
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,730
to do that

417
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,060
please please do that we really
important really useful

418
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,159
arm the other option would be something
like you know there are some

419
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,810
a ECCA elected crypto Griffey chips

420
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,360
very cheap they're like forty fifty
cents arm

421
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,129
which would also probably allow you to
do it on a on a really cheap device like

422
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,790
this with any

423
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,159
control so I i think

424
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,630
you know it's a balance isn't it do you
do in hardware with the shield

425
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,240
or and then and then it's sorta
overtaken by improving CP is but on the

426
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,270
other hand

427
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,570
those there's a pic controls get cheaper
cheaper and so

428
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,250
the ability of Taylor's on a really
really cheap device is also useful tips

429
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:13,810
on

430
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,030
your give you compliments bottle of
water or speakers get that

431
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,550
just ok thank you very much

432
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,580
we have a five minute break and then we
will talk

433
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,918
on the next
