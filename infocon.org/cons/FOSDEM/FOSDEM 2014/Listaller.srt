1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,630
1x the honesty terrorism dependable
reply res interest to meet up soon

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,870
package 22 developments and midsummer

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,338
contribution to our this tonight Jenna
did you know

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,070
number and today we speak about to
release 2.0

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,869
which is a way to run a distributer but
if it is shown serb as no not

6
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,948
buckets 22 Anaheim better closer

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,510
day but yes

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,320
Matt s on on

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,070
a case but the from what I can anyone
hear me bow

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,899
good

11
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,800
its have a better night yeah across I'm

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,699
the I it went into this year to heal the
Stoller which is a simple and secure way

13
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,629
to disappear third-party applications

14
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,070
after a sec before are in other words
this

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,650
another solution for two create cross
the solution packages

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,950
saw first of all you might all know this
one

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,420
so I am I creator with some others

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,520
a quest to seduce in packaging system at
the already how

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,000
packaging systems we have running these
steps to be a sudden

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,509
and they also have some I for aiming for
a similar goal so um

21
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,330
first of all I S inspector answer the
question why do we need

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,048
across this era insulation system at all
so

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,009
some first the main reason to stop
people what new software

24
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,439
which is not available and that
decisions they have a stable base

25
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,908
a decision and once the latest and
greatest up to be installed and

26
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,399
to try dollars now rolling release the
citizens but they don't fit

27
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,009
everyone's I use cases because there are
so many people who want

28
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,479
a stable of writing spoke rating system
which does not

29
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,909
exchange the counter or other components
Plaza some

30
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,290
um also but that could be back ports

31
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,530
about stuff the distributer resources I
usually limit at

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,669
and stress people are interested and I'm

33
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,319
in back parking stuff to a stable
distribution so there's a great lack of

34
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,980
manpower and it also has some

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,629
other issues when you try to back or
something um

36
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,780
now costs third party app I repositories

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,910
which are called in the 2012 Walt ke
paas personal packets ourselves

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,870
but those are in secure and they can
potentially break just system

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,950
for example after PBA packager
introduces new packages

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,750
whence a that and I get replaced by
either packages from the distributor was

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,860
just like a different

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,349
during an upgrade y'all upgrade will
fail added you will have a broken system

43
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,470
when Cisco very difficult to recover at
least four

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,650
for user Squires don't have a technical
background

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,450
also every year packaging so there's
some

46
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,170
has the option to I'm two-out two-run

47
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,879
um scripts isometric permission so if
you install an application from a

48
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,010
militia source

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,379
you know I'm you really don't know what
this thing is doing I miss you looked

50
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,040
into it

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,290
but usually use a stone to that before
then south of for

52
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,659
because they want to see the software
running and don't bother with the

53
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,849
installation process

54
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,649
and Richard F reviewing a packet's also

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,680
last but not least PBS our decision
specific that many pts furnace of

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,620
furniture only available for 812

57
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,680
but for Joe and Debbie and needs

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,330
different sources so let's are yeah
doesn't spend on

59
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,430
it for what's up to the case and the
open source a bill service also

60
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,510
party that is still have to ride lots of
different aspect files to pack

61
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,250
everything

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,110
um also if you have trouble she want to
ship to suppress a binary installer

63
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,879
you're getting up the problem that this
will execute code during installation

64
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,689
which often happens with your permission
so it's not something we've got strips

65
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:04,659
should be wanting to do you so I am why
is this dollar better in that regard

66
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,429
in for civil it was built a system
integration in mind that's means that

67
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,970
the user should never noticed that the
South as

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,680
used when the song applications some
applications

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,310
cert when they are installed integrates
the seamlessly with

70
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,199
every existing application the system so
they should not look like

71
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,600
foreign objects to to the system quest
to the user

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,729
um also saw for updates appear achieved

73
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,180
automatically using the same user
interface for spare us the system uses

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,860
itself

75
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,270
because a sometimes if you are
installing

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,460
after party stuff from the next you how
on

77
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,349
like another Updater application and
this is really not

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm not just a friendly to do that to
happen what might have a source us

79
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,380
to install suffer or to update your
system um

80
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,030
across its ok because test run cut
across that's a compatible

81
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,789
and it's a peace symbol which means that
the star it's not able to install

82
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,490
I basic system components like for
example in in that system

83
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,919
all I i'm a toolkit something which
house

84
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,380
reverse dependencies on itself because
the sour

85
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,210
Moscow solely for applications are cycle
if packages

86
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,198
and everything else which screen
requires integration by the distributer

87
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,250
should be handled by the distributor and
not by in the upstream project which is

88
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,070
creating the style the package it's

89
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,229
of Gaza should be secure this man
stopped every a sub packages usually

90
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,250
assigned

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,930
a signature size checked against
in-state have a test to see if

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,610
are if it doesn't look as a militia
signature of the signature

93
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,570
is known to be militias and every
application installs with the Sala

94
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,120
what this on Fox which space soon with
some be possible using the kidney bus

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
stock which I lost

96
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,180
pursing large chunks of data into a
sound box using portals

97
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,910
but that's a different technology which
is planning implementation

98
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,410
the seller also provides developer tools
which means dot

99
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,430
I'm happen developers get help first to
make the application running multiple

100
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,580
distributions

101
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,639
and I packaging bottle it's really
simple for them

102
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
which means they only in me to write a
small file usually

103
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,970
and then they can start again get
started with packaging

104
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,050
so um after telling you all about it you
can imagine that the solid consists of

105
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,449
multiple tools

106
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,389
which are can be divided into engines
are applications which are

107
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,020
of for example as an application to set
up the sound of that runs the

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,049
application

109
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,210
I'm an application to manage that a
database of trust the keys

110
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,590
lots of developer tools by which I mean
different things from

111
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,619
tracing dependencies 2 I'm to making the
application relocate abortion is that

112
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,360
they can place it anywhere on the file
system and they will still find

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,690
it's our depend on data files I'm

114
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,750
and also a of course and I'm generator
for the Stella packages

115
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,560
and one a tool to generate update
sources and repositories to

116
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,210
other decoration appearing of on the
hell up access

117
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,729
a star repositories with my aunts which
target the whole index market

118
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,199
to set up a repository with us our
packages and every Linux distribution

119
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
can embed it and can use it

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,930
so how does this work the solitaire
spider actually

121
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,530
a package could plug in which means that
it runs inside packets get

122
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,630
Pakistan it for those people who
actually we don't know what the deaths

123
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,990
is a tool where it's I'm it's a
disservice

124
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,180
which takes requests from clients via
suffer senators

125
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,680
a package managers our update viewers
and then performs

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,389
an accent on the native a distribution
interface

127
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,729
I'm wishing for Pakistan that spike in
sports get called by

128
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,919
that depressed and demand running as
root and

129
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,940
and then they get asked to perform the
actual

130
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,949
accent on the I'm on the net if
distribution packs management interface

131
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,280
so this Tyler now hotspot hooks into
this

132
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,559
by creating some kind of meta back and
between DNA test back and

133
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,960
and the packets kids a obstruction so

134
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,378
effects cats receive special requests in
stalin the stalin

135
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,190
packets I'm and the sour note as a stop
to incite extended will perform

136
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,710
I'm the installation of the new pockets
and send all information about this new

137
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,609
packets

138
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,270
I'll the packets get it package gets the
bus interface back to the clients

139
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,940
so for the clients it doesn't matter if
they install at the Stella packets are

140
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,590
native to sedition packets

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,698
because for they have for them it's just
just now

142
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,419
doesn't matter at all um if there is a
net effect of course the style I will

143
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,468
are led it through and some the outlet
that let the back and perform the

144
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,080
appropriate action

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,399
I'm but I can also credited the back and
then some Star Trek to you

146
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,060
which means that the seller has to have
the opportunity to talk directly to the

147
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,029
net distribution package manager

148
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,540
and some well resolve dependencies and
install a I'm

149
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,250
and start missing a dependency set
necessary

150
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,940
I speaking arm about the panacea scum

151
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,080
in order to make a follow up work on
multiple distributions

152
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,160
and to have dependencies which tests
something

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,910
we want at least our basic I basic
dependencies like to decay

154
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,949
um because if Cheryl think the whole

155
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,000
talkin statically and the distributor
putting I'm process and I

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,720
an update to its fixed the critical
security hole and you have an

157
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,870
application running on a system which
has for example to talk at statically

158
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,600
linked

159
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,350
you won't get that security fixin to
production because the

160
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,510
statically linked driver settling
defecation was still here scott told

161
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,589
rivalry

162
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:43,080
so I'm it is a good idea to have at
least some base level of the panel sees

163
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,160
and in order to know resolve
dependencies

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,350
using the native distribution package
manager I might have a detention

165
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,980
seles tower is I some so-called
components which defy and the interface

166
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,970
this an upstream

167
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,040
a project provides which binary search
libraries and its recurrence relations

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,890
the dust that

169
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,180
ideally it also ships assembles fires so
we can sack

170
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,810
I'm if they're abie compatibility is
given

171
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,209
um then the farmers use this component
riots have

172
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,760
actually find the right to privacy in
the decision database

173
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,329
so it's to some extent depends on Ashton
projects to rights component files

174
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,779
but there are some workarounds but
because this is a lie can talk I can't

175
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,560
go into detail

176
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,219
am so let's walk through the process and
packets ball past after reading the

177
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,070
government developer documentation

178
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,360
are you developer decides that is a good
idea to create a package for that

179
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,579
in order to do that we need to do from
to do a few things

180
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:44,180
first a whole write an app data file
Updater is part of the upstream efforts

181
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,800
to

182
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,189
create cost us additional suffer Sanders
and

183
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,230
57 app data file you know application
where the

184
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,959
be represented better than any suffer
Center because we will have more met

185
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,010
today to take into account

186
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,300
so um inch an update to follow its just
a small bit of XML

187
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,529
which defines spell the project summary
a description

188
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,399
I the name I deaths of file a home
paychecks

189
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,360
et cetera and some some other stuff
stallone take this file

190
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,880
onto and present the application to the
user and say yes to installing this

191
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,019
stuffing right now and I'm later

192
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,190
it will also inject that data into the
option database

193
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,540
so every passing away our sofa center is
able to display

194
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,449
the list all applications out just like
any other application was just installed

195
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,250
from a native distribution source

196
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,370
continue to rights a few routes I'm in

197
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,570
how to compile the application this can
be done using up compile

198
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,180
here because I has a small rupture which
were detectable system and both the

199
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,739
stuff

200
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,740
and works with a few well system so far
I

201
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,410
but yeah you can also abs I'm all
instructions on how to build

202
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,540
are applications manually there

203
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,219
then it's file listing a stellar does
not use and I

204
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,430
absolute 5 often said to Jesus ratify
the cost

205
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,170
when you can play as your application
and on the desk i'm not during

206
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,370
installation at the start with then
decides

207
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,870
a depending on the distributions policy
where to put

208
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,180
the application files and therefore the
distributor

209
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,319
in the and controls however everything
is installed

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,470
I also need to write a it's a copy chaos
since file

211
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,850
which testify and stuff how the up extra
a San

212
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,190
creation process will be done and worse
portion of the

213
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,709
packaging standards you might want to
use then

214
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,569
it just need to generate your packets
which will automatically run desk and

215
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,040
which is a small tool to detect

216
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,199
all dependencies application house and
that match them the two components using

217
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,420
the component interface definition nice

218
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,389
have some you before in this case i mean
for example detected a case 3G left

219
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:51,100
aksar ok

220
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,829
and i cant seem and sister my wish cost
this thing is called

221
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:58,138
Lakhpat and then it was just

222
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,180
generate the packet structure and sign
the packets and spread whether through

223
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,609
with a small tool to

224
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,779
holiday its on holiday its have

225
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,200
peace S of the upstream work in order to
get a high quality packets and to say

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,630
tell us your head you're doing this
wrong maybe fix it I

227
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,459
next time and the summit doing the hots
for you can address one of the concerns

228
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,930
of this interest at upstream projects
mites create crappy packages

229
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,069
because the Sala one tallow doing that
and

230
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,660
if there are some mind my no tricks
which can be done it well one

231
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,500
the option to help rid of that sunday
and Jaffa packets

232
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,440
this can then be installed but the user
using the native Pakistan

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,649
back sketch package management tools arm
or

234
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,290
using an tools which are dedicated for
installing the solid package just

235
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,550
I'm but I am the long-term plans are to

236
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,130
to get rid of the east there are is a
extension to Pakistan's which hole about

237
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,779
it done and I a few weeks which might
render

238
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,130
the additional interface completely
obsolete

239
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,449
some yeah so silent and search for
native packages switched clear that they

240
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:08,209
support

241
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,290
the missing components and install them

242
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,380
if they're first others unable to
satisfy the finances

243
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,949
it isn't that a fax mannequin packets
manager at can also fall back to

244
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:22,459
gets defenses some other sources if it
is configured

245
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,750
to be allowed to do that because a
systems administrator

246
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,029
might not want out just how r tries to
get satisfy the dependency from

247
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,370
I potentially and trusted source s like
about

248
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,910
after party repository is an artist who
I satisfied application dependencies

249
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,860
than in the anthony is a wants to run I
blocked Pat sorry excuse for a nap while

250
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,680
Petra set up the sound box

251
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,359
and to some some other crazy stuff so
the application is able to find

252
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,440
dependencies on yeah bands

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,600
that I and II this thing right now only
supports

254
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,779
older and I'm just surprised though that
the supply siders

255
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,209
so not at all support the new device
activated application switches

256
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,469
some the a new way to start up like a
sense and at least I'm

257
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,910
in future developers can also create
updates repository is switches

258
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,279
a also pretty simple and straightforward
I

259
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,810
in order to generate and out so like
future and

260
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,579
yeah are in our example our our User
decides to remain off the car removal

261
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,370
patsy just often Sapera

262
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,120
on KTVU the 20 the issues too work tear
just two years to work with packages

263
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,259
find small pet they are and tipsy on
dance all about and that's just gone

264
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,509
without but we have any problems yeah

265
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:44,509
and that sets %ah

266
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,930
when the time for a quick question maybe
even

267
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,109
i said im for

268
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,110
boo

269
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:05,399
so if I understand you correctly you
should but by Matisse

270
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,880
but how do you arm solve the problem of

271
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,949
installing an Arms Trade the next
because he said you don't specify time

272
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:15,229
is that accurate estimates all but then

273
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,449
you have known me libraries and they
don't know where to find lebanese and

274
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,479
things like that

275
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,579
I'm glad there are two approaches to the
hot sand in the sahara

276
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,859
wanna spat self which will its aim
should be out header of the

277
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,940
binary which is really actually is so
the preferred way right now is that the

278
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,560
right now publication sets

279
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,069
the library haha for the new libraries
and that's what makes

280
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,190
I the application find this library is
if they are

281
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:45,190
living in a different directory I've
been to talk to you about that

282
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,920
boo

283
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,380
a Hello wrangling question I don't love
you already said

284
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,700
but can you use and not this back its
management system like

285
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,029
ABT gets to install least other packages
and

286
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:03,910
at No you count the test than the on the
net effect us

287
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,129
management system would have to link
against that was tolerant in order to be

288
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,400
able to do the same

289
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,449
attack a sketch that's right now it is a
theory

290
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,480
it's possible but I don't think a

291
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,660
the of streams of net tax measures 1 to
do that right now I think

292
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,059
then ask questions

293
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,170
but its for Manchester given a doctor
and turn on this topic tomorrow morning

294
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,550
he December drink

295
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,280
this regard upstream in stone walls and
it's at ten o'clock

296
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,700
yeah %ah
