1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,620
like my fan club first %ah I am NOT
talking about the issue today but I will

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,730
be talking about you by

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,860
which is a brand new projects what we
call the

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,000
flexible days of a framework I

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,320
so what is it it's a framework that
allows you to build the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,420
pipelines I signs of data processing

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,180
I from data sources

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,539
on to better things so all one of
several sources to one of several things

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,360
1 I'm speaking out on dates of I mean
the essentially

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,519
pictures and sounds because we're in the
mood to medium business

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,629
but so if candy is a suitable for any
kind of data that does no sign of frames

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:43,449
of packets

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,870
I'll soho the pipeline is composed of

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,800
modules but we cool pipes I and you five

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,559
is a frame or the defined API's up
eleven first

16
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,570
to configure the park's so typical
configuration commands would be

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,979
I'll ascend you output to this all the
pipes also that is do you bike set the

18
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:05,900
output commands

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,119
all open this file for reading or
writing try

20
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,520
there is an A in a guy to find a time to
buy this is back at

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,970
process it I'll you but also defines an
API

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,030
to move a modules to throw up

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,290
in Venice what I college events is on
for instance of well

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,689
the for the end the fight is reached
what do we do our

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,658
there has been a fatal error what do we
do hurt will be done in a Division I

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,240
also love

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,740
the so that the kind of you and someone
really comes through and so we haven't

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,899
yet to come that's

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,030
I'll we also have an API that defines
what the

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,619
sure it is I in an efficient manner how
come back about later and the 2i was

31
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,250
also to

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,229
I to love to give attributes

33
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,380
28 about robert reich tributes to each
day's other

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,460
and the finally the Sony P I'll the
close to interact with a and %um so

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,548
are combat combat later as well you
fight is also distribution

36
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,630
of standards I basic bites

37
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,109
unless he leased to you know at the end
of the presentation

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,190
for what Commission be used for her

39
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,810
well when the mighty dub is nice I and
the company I work for open heavens

40
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,120
the need upset you by try I'll

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,780
is sewing up what both got equipments so
that would be typically

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,260
trench coat or a smoke detectors up
their systems

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,649
a mosaic systems where you can have
several the North a

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,730
sources haha inside one of I'll put a

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,079
and also we've worked on embedded
platforms how to make sure

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,980
embedded distribute demonstration
platform so I ended me up there's

47
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,220
the front is very lightweight so it's
quite adopted

48
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,540
quotable for that I love no question
probably asking her right now is what

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,489
yet another

50
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,920
I much and F remarks and now and 2014
-ism that would be something that exist

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,420
for that

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,450
whether yes there is I Israel see the
title pretty well how

53
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,179
others mister of course I know she from
March I and probably more although

54
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,930
there is out in the open source projects
however I'm not

55
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,519
most of these brothers are at least 15
just years old of

56
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,330
and their own me know what new trends
that emerged in that since the time

57
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,269
they've been designed

58
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,040
in particular I'll whether the
generalization of superscalar

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,030
architectures

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,690
no all this abuse of civil court I think
the cushion

61
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,609
even yourself on the house tool for
course I also the framework

62
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,409
has to provide ways for applications to
take advantage of so cause if needed

63
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm not also a new trend in the

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,290
what development industry in what we
call it even driven loops

65
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,700
or a synchronous programming that from
two been introduced with me and

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,849
eventually BV

67
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,349
a for what server is initially is
something i ndex

68
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,619
and they said technology that allows you
to register in advance

69
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,640
the like I want to be notified when
there's something to read on that site

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,040
gets

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,390
all I want to be notified when the timer
expires

72
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,790
and you will get a call back by the
framework and so this him

73
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,009
but kind of a new way of programming
applications

74
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,380
II sure it's been done allies for the in
the past 10 years

75
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,759
and the much about three months need to
take that into account

76
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,780
I also in existing within the frameworks
man has been more difficult

77
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,460
because the a lot of majority I and the
complexity of the modules

78
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,150
princeton's a transport stream deluxe in
most remote address one module

79
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,359
the so you up just 100 entry points that
you configure

80
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,030
in your pipe if you look at the source
code with about 10 models to implement

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,940
it just looks

82
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,979
14 area TV table and so on

83
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,740
and so you can arrange a and gotta find
shown %um

84
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,479
just came outside to large and also my
husband and more difficult because of

85
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,460
the confusion

86
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,349
in some of those how much between the
what we call data processing

87
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,530
and the season what I call decision is
I'm

88
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,460
deciding which elementary stream I want
to go to harlem trends or do I want to

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,620
but so is unlocked

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,780
I'll and weak spots which models running
some chance but for the time this is

91
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,669
done either by the models themselves

92
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,219
all the free market stuff and we think
it should be the task of the application

93
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,960
I'll so we've designed the API to allow
the application

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,060
to get the defense I from the modules
and

95
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,410
do the decision but itself also I'm

96
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,800
well I i mean the professional broadcast
world and the

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,449
problem we have is most notably
frameworks and thats up to be designed

98
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,560
for a while

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,570
kind of the biggest sandwiches a

100
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,550
please play this file I have and the
user name on the display output

101
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,560
until X whatever I'll and them sometimes
we don't want to access a lower level

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,860
APIs

103
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,449
like to just transcoding with my
fine-tuning

104
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,090
and generates more like to happen to the
framework

105
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,960
so you but they've been designed for all
that kind of of

106
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,400
use case I'll

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,630
so we started watching you by Connie two
years ago

108
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,050
a with new policies huh so we've decided

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,300
to specify its of Bahamut usually do

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,620
you to specify the object of down that
is so this is the ability to I want to

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,470
expose to the application and then I'll
go down I'm

112
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,850
try to find a the simplest data
structures

113
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,850
with the Hindu contrary we ask ourselves

114
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,310
what to the known simplest a structure

115
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,979
but could refer them to a moment you
look like but is a simplistic so that

116
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,409
could refer them to but sure

117
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,710
and then we built on top of that %uh
they're yours of API's

118
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,960
and so the front a level of API's a
possible

119
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,568
with new 5 look and talk to the lower
level API which we currently most to use

120
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,550
but you can imagine a higher level of
API have well

121
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,770
we try to keep models I symbol and a
list of possible but

122
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,080
unique still also think and that allows
us to

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,460
do very intensively unit tests including

124
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,729
I'll take the memory leaks with vibrant
all our code course without comment

125
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,430
I'll will seven faces some documentation

126
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,900
probably through them now so what I took
into with tutorials

127
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,469
I and not only in doxie done but also on
comprehensive documentation on the

128
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,789
frameworks

129
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,009
and the one last thing that is very
appreciated her

130
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,440
by professionals that we try to follow
standards as much as possible

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,259
we do not aim at playing every single
calling could try

132
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,699
a if if I these not is for I couldn't
stand up for the specs

133
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,009
but remain the plates and we happy with
that

134
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,629
I'll so for the licensing hah

135
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:56,440
we try the very aggressive approach the
court is under the MIT license

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,060
that so I triage unit as can be you can
use it even in the

137
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,919
in computer applications some Jews are
in the GPO iGPS

138
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,878
hah license

139
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,229
so how do we compare against the
existing frameworks

140
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,068
all other trademarks a at first glance
we are lower levels higher than most of

141
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,030
them

142
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,429
I because and education can really
decide how to design of I

143
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,020
the pipeline in the depiction decide
what to do trentadue

144
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,000
design with the but ring she was and so
on

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,089
we offer a unified API for all kind of
what does not have any titles will see

146
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,219
like that for things

147
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,820
negotiators with the same age I for
everybody

148
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,550
and that's so thanks to a compass on the
job done

149
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,760
%uh allows to a in fact that's a drop
for how long

150
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,290
but I do recall like lightning EV went
to the one we use consummate it could be

151
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,769
adopted

152
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:56,490
to Julie bought any other kind of event
so far as well

153
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,670
and the 11 it may sound funny I

154
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,760
first to hear that well there's nothing
you buy tombstone threats

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,860
ok to handle modest wedding but we know
we manage the her

156
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,360
super scholar hi use case by having

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
I look less awake this data structures
hollow structures

158
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
how the class what we've got a lot of
this the first full day in film

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,810
but because we have a look with people's
fortunes ISO the tray much as

160
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,000
optimized for super star chick said from
the start

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,550
I'll possibly make a I'm not a big use
of

162
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,939
I connection transex I'll

163
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,279
but those to do i delete reference
counting

164
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,220
almost all sectors are across counted so
you don't have to move to care about 12

165
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,310
really is a structure

166
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,869
it's not automatically when the rest
count goes down to zero

167
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,070
strict BBDO located and initialized

168
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,120
that also allows us to implement option
rights but for semantics

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,260
so you can have the same buffer that is
in different stages of the pipelines

170
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,800
different branches transom for the pie
class without having to copy the data

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,779
the data we gonna be copied if

172
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,510
it must be modified so that is so that
is something that from the beginning as

173
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,140
well

174
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,230
well so I does your cookie her semantics

175
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,029
that is you can build up but rose from
single from smaller pieces of butter

176
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,730
saying this picture is made of 100 just
packets

177
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,600
and API allows to to me been visible her
how to hop

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
one other just take it without cooking
anything until the end until you need to

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,880
add its

180
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,010
continued in the company continues but
for

181
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,569
so I talked about attributes of I what
Google attributes

182
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,810
is I Triplett name of

183
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,329
tight end of you so the name can be
totally arbitrary with a standard action

184
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,760
but I've swatch

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,250
dates I'm storms presentation time
stopped recording time stops

186
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,920
durations but you can define your own
attributes and

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,060
and attach them to tomb to buffer at any
time

188
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,060
and it would be propagated throw the
fight crime

189
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,910
so that's an interesting feature also
and lastly for

190
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,519
very interesting feature a high is that
you can die then we could build a

191
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,779
the pipeline when you catch events from

192
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,630
from modules for instance you can
capture an event that says I from now on

193
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,230
I have a new elementary stream live a
subtitle streams for instance

194
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,899
and the because you can catch that to
dance and I locate apocryphal

195
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,190
the pipeline between deal with this all
even modified

196
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,649
the another part of the time to to do
something else because the Rays

197
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:30,980
something that happens as long as you're
in the same thread

198
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,360
you can modify the content on wall so
it's a quite dynamic

199
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,420
pulls up for them the upside of the
product

200
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,899
on the downside is you must understand
that is a very young product

201
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,360
so that means that we are fewer models
from the existing for a prime most by

202
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,180
far

203
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,130
I'm but skill level support for Obama
decoding audio encoding

204
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,189
a and also I'm sure users so few people
to protest

205
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,709
I'll I have to be completely honest
without

206
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:05,260
so about the status I we've just really
is lol cool you fight review with his

207
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,510
number two

208
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,050
I went quite happy with the PI and with
no plans to Chancellor I to study

209
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,649
module level and application level APIs
for the moment

210
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,730
we may want to improve a via API by
adding new cool stuff to make

211
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,110
about to get some developers Elisha is
your

212
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,519
but's it's quite a good stopping point
you come to have a look at it

213
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,829
I and stopped looking for its ions are
already many models

214
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,120
but are available I'll from

215
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
home external libraries right support
for them thanks Ashley Davies

216
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,160
not support for x264 I and we are to
assure

217
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,779
native modules antarctica TS deluxe and
just smokes

218
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,110
this is all coal business I and
everything the family tree the fire

219
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,339
treat for streams from your GP or HDPE
and so on and we are

220
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,320
you to tomatoes stuffed duck which %uh
those YouTube to branch

221
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,670
in your pipelines a trip they wanted to
cheering

222
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,689
of data and she was of course

223
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,050
I relate to and the talk with a few
examples so

224
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,339
this one is an example of the

225
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,560
whether the GX place %uh

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,410
example a it s3 threats the main thread

227
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,410
that is running the GLX I know

228
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,180
a module and the dust settle on a source
website reads data from the Metro come

229
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,310
from the file

230
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,869
and one thread decoding thread I'll

231
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,040
that takes data from I the source and
decoded

232
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,290
up to on to have to put it Irish

233
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,099
so you can see the use of she was here
2012 after the source rather than 12

234
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,740
after the year eighty connects thread
I'll

235
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,529
again as I think the way you do that you
lost I

236
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,870
we have no problems with frameworks who
require you to

237
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,880
do all you outputs in one thread a
friend stunts the PAPI of chrome

238
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,449
requires you to have all you are putting
one thread a bunch of chronic an excuse

239
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:09,189
but we'd reached all the first one
single thread and I'll put them from the

240
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,230
stress

241
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,370
a you can really build about as you want

242
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,300
finally this is an example of what is a
bit more complicated of

243
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,439
that's a a real application that runs in
our products

244
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,550
but according to you we could harsh it's
a program

245
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,279
that does a 44 things at once but
received no you de streams

246
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,279
that's on top of it I and its

247
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,199
my first it relied a the first two
months just the first

248
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,550
the to the disk so that today to sing on
the on the left

249
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,469
at the same time it right to the
reception times of its buffer

250
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,579
to our index right off but the oxime on
the on the right

251
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,040
a the source file allows you to play
replay

252
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,910
this the screen exactly I'm using
sipgate protect shifting purposes or

253
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,319
debugging purposes or whether

254
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,139
and the big blob in the middle ascension
to just the notes and the decoder

255
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,430
a that allow us to do two things a first

256
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,459
a we have a date extinction so we %um
right thumb nails

257
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,609
other stream on the almost cried and the

258
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,940
also we'll hash think we tried to finger
prints

259
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,380
I got so hours to do it whether

260
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,959
quickly you know protection home on the
stream

261
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,229
so all of this runs in three threads on
the symbolize to hear

262
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,680
and a schematic but some

263
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,279
it's something that could have been very
difficult to do and many other products

264
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,389
on friday marks so um

265
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,190
to summarize a the phone we do with the
ex you to keep in touch with us when you

266
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,110
have more information on the web sites

267
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,339
we also 24/7 on IRC on Fri Nov

268
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:51,910
remain least and I just bought two
morrow I'm

269
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,290
go home I 2 o'clock show it to me tough
so you know

270
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,670
if you're interested you can ask a
question here I'm not sure we left

271
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,969
many time to question but if your
question you can go by tomorrow at two

272
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,660
o'clock

273
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,360
and we do around and we've been able to
answer a few questions tomorrow

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
yes you have the time right now for 102
West okay

275
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,570
there is more than one person Google I

276
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,529
re going from

277
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,490
I'm so this may be a true you quite
vague question and you might want to go

278
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,980
for more specific ones

279
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,410
though you mentioned unit s4 while the
multimedia framework

280
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,469
and I just would like to know more about
what approach did you take for this

281
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,930
I'm what basically every time we went to
new module

282
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,969
by would like it I F I talk with annual
Pride whether you need deficit in

283
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,820
without

284
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,370
that so with us and the couple commence
to intimately tied to find a time to its

285
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,070
think they sell and randomly generated a
soft

286
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,160
and the would take for if the output

287
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,439
is while the same as what is supposed to
be fine

288
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,470
I and if in 10 days it's considered to
be an era

289
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,049
or if there is a minority candidate but
by green is also supposed to be an era

290
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,520
so that still fights now we also I'm
lots of

291
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,150
the source file isn't that far in two
months while before management

292
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,819
all you perm and these for you but I'm
trying since it's tested by having a

293
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,250
unit test that

294
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,079
Fox several tried some and that tries to

295
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,480
well gonna send bacchus two different
shoes

296
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,440
but will be read by the from threats and
then we would text that we receive the

297
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,100
whole

298
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,678
but hers in the correct older I and that
we do not leak anything and so on

299
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,230
so I'm buddy and first by

300
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,220
the interests of I'll up for the free
much better everybody was very

301
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,510
autonomous

302
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,890
so you don't have to import thousands of
lines of

303
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,950
