1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,040
specifically in the little better shape
almost over and then and let you and you

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,590
can omit anuses but two years I haven't
given up on the chopping bridge

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,889
quite the yeah I'm not look for the
Intel zoetis say

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,859
sings all three years or so say

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,859
deign to graphics driver home I think
that was our claim to fame for the first

6
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,859
team 3d a sweet totally dominated

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,920
the regression wiest and that was for
the

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,380
very few people there actually the lucky
enough to have

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,710
working make setting driver with all the
shiny new

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,940
kill mode setting Staff and Gen ATTCEO

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,449
even if you've been looking all we make
them shoot up a mex care would be broken

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,300
for you

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,000
II know we say that's kinda knocked the
not the

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,010
thing you wanna have so

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,579
we also continue to like broke the same
things again we have like the same

16
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,670
box Paul Paul Paul again so I was like
tuna passes for Dane told driver

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,460
50 passes new features in the home to
fifty trying think stitched together

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,860
again all this thinking

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,750
so week we have to be better than that
on the

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,880
that's what I'm gonna talk back because
we can opt at the top

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,158
anymore all this number for I'm

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,170
defaced thing we still wanted wave was

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,350
all have some test cases at least

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,919
I'll a little bit if more I formal
testing more than

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,509
Compal shaped by it and my face
realisation wheels

26
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,530
all this literally no tests think that's
very stand known

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,420
tests ape-like there seems to be no
bought some to have bad it can be in

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,689
that still useful

29
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,320
or at least we didn't bottom act because
the first thing we had was a buncha

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,298
packed together

31
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,060
test applications used t like the sign
Jan

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,790
I'll nephew Mike shebang smaltz hacked
together they've out to makes test

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,070
running first rupture

34
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,090
and that was the face tests we we have
in the actual call

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,410
box say without the candy store yet

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,560
and did a lot about this thing stay

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,599
so when gonna talk about today I saw

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,349
faced accounted process changes mean
film

39
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,429
like thank ship it if it compiles

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,560
I the next move may I saw

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,280
on gonna talk a little bit have added
tests infrastructure to be reinvented

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,840
becas

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,080
every organ we'll kind o didn't lick to
pacing

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,010
I'm that the third topic is a

45
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,179
talking about specific test techniques

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,060
the fatass think anal drive act can
graphics drivers

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,590
becas there's an awful lot of stuff

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,590
all think I know traditionally you can
add me

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,409
to have eyes looking at the screen to
see whether it breaks correctly because

50
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:05,739
that kinda stuff or also say I

51
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,920
all the interactions can chip in
specific stuff like

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,700
they actually tend to hang a law say you
need to have a reliable reset

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,319
and how you can pass that say

54
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,450
pretty much what the faith things mean

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,659
da Mesa in-stadium rolling next branch

56
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,159
which a big by

57
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,150
essentially they for me there is no
match when they're

58
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,510
I just marriage passes all the time

59
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,590
and every two weeks attacked they

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,760
attack it of I send out of to evacuate
the poll

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
might actually wait for that test
results and then if they say it's not

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,500
totally broken

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,890
eiffel with Italian upstream today TT

64
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,458
to the agreement a I'm here to grace at
except for the match when they've been

65
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,620
it's a stall

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,019
what would have been nice things is we
actually used the QSP

67
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,420
back and it was not like we got the Q a
book report at the same time as late as

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,879
to what's was screaming at us

69
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,069
so that to get improved the other thing
was also based there is no patch

70
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,798
build-up say because the thing is just a
rolling

71
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,090
big the caught office out of my hands so

72
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,418
it manages com Iran and Tom you really
have to integrate that I can just say

73
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,340
also sorry its kinda gone already and
there's like 30

74
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,859
the one we got the way for the Qian the
marriage we know happened so

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,310
that allow me the put off a lot of
pressure

76
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,740
so that's that's kinda they the process
changes we've gone

77
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,930
the other day thing we saw

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,199
nowadays tests and testing is kinda
integral to the development process that

79
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,250
would

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,759
there was a lot of other fic playing
worse the past year

81
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,400
but essentially will I require your name
free

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,130
to passes to give ministers if you're
adding a new interface someone to fill

83
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,440
interface testing all the corner cases
although we're flows all the invalid

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,940
flax checking that

85
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,560
all that testing is kinda dumb which
which helps a lot for

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,030
this signing saying APIs so we

87
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,900
only stop being stupid things like not
checking for flax and then use the space

88
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,888
a submitting random Corbijn these
additional spare fails and so we can

89
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,270
actually use them

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,830
are its is also often known as part of
the review

91
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,080
now and i say like if someone writes a
passion

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,139
mechanic try it. are

93
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,380
teach someone else about this topic

94
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,180
in is not going to stay to review been
also rights in past cases

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,169
kind as as a late-inning spins at the
low thing is I'll

96
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,030
I mean this kinda testing for a date the
ridiculous box than the occasional I

97
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,989
hate

98
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm and they on this some people he

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,690
belief and test-driven development like

100
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,840
art write test cases first and then fix
it

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,179
that the problem with the cable is this
so such common in total exploration of

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,080
things that can go

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,330
wrong its it's an eternal toss I'm

104
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,620
also think it's a stupid idea because
some people just

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,069
try to make the test cases pass then
think about what that thing actually

106
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:20,889
anymore

107
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,250
so the approach we can the using is
kinda book driven testing

108
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,280
say we which i think the a base coverage

109
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,948
a exercise the dryer or a new features
somewhat

110
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,990
I mean if something actually blown stop
being private ice

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,819
case for that specific thing I'm I seems
to be

112
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,590
fairly gay that at kinda

113
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,900
directing the testing efforts into
useful their action

114
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,758
because yeah I've if if you just this
just two months things that can go wrong

115
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
so it's it's much better team tasked
with actually goes wrong in the real

116
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,419
world

117
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,900
say that was kinda day all

118
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,270
the the process changes all

119
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,440
we also have tea light Ste

120
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,599
trade it infrastructure stuff now a days
may use a pic to rate this a test run a

121
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,250
frame rate which is saw

122
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,389
something amazing guy started years ago
I'm

123
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,440
extremely useful for them I in his team
part speculate will miss the actual Open

124
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,330
GL

125
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,030
I know CL test Casey there wasn't don't
use that

126
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,690
but there's the pie tin tests running

127
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,710
on the the poor this I will be use

128
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,530
all woman reason for it

129
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,500
chasing Taylor the sites that though

130
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,560
everyone else and open-source graphics
will come to use this act and it's also

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,400
it also has like test wrong wrappers for
all kinds a bodice sayings that they are

132
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,060
radio X test suite has a wrap a nice
thanks Eric Anholt that their

133
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,360
Olympic dramas geo conform tests me can
be run through that thing so we can I

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
use that for everything

135
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,270
I'll well when I look at the rand

136
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,719
two years ago a stream for potential
tests we promise

137
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,389
they all kinda issue that you can a
bright mean task cases and you don't

138
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,780
have a pile ups

139
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,190
horrible seek ok but you want to reduce
just because we had adaran

140
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,949
so that was kinda problem the other
thing was

141
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,849
all the tests seats and ron is life and
very true

142
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,700
testing like software but you seem that
the few bright ass Casey

143
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,399
it it'll always be able to wrong but we
me retesting hall that platform so

144
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,670
a load of the features are only on way
below on some kernel versions on Sol

145
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,890
on some Hall bit platform so we Habsi

146
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,779
have Skype support because otherwise
have a test case certainly doesn't wrong

147
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:56,140
you

148
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,120
you wanna know about that as a
regression so you need to track

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,459
that the skip past as the Skip case

150
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,060
are separately say and pick the halls
has all that because it Italian

151
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,699
open she always a vision baby I am

152
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,940
massive amounts extension sorry mates
that

153
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,330
and piglet itself as a bunch of things
up

154
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,750
you can restart past rounds at the
machine by that a

155
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,980
it captures today Ms Cruz all used by
was a law

156
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,560
because me try really hard at everything
which

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,399
is actually American dish maze lock this
as Warner a ball of

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,740
in the mask and everything which is not
is is actually just

159
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,990
the doctor Aaron Paul level we are

160
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,620
we have a lot of patches action that
area T tune that an old

161
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,570
print casing the book leftovers from
development

162
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,180
there I'll couples can yeah

163
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,279
/span /p mass I it had

164
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,700
a timeout support to kill light
long-running test seats in case the

165
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,860
kernel happening or

166
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,529
I mean you're you have a massive span of
hardware so running

167
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,839
especially the stress tests on all
platforms or are some at bats low embed

168
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,480
SRC platforms just

169
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,019
takes too long so we have that but then
for sleeping a piping has like

170
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,579
or seems to have some conclusions the
box at at the fact that

171
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,300
me to restore it

172
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,399
the next port is a

173
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,060
Intel chief utils thats there are over
colonel test

174
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,060
cases actually reside a it started in
Imphal cheap you tools because we just

175
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,160
need to use the Site kinda

176
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,360
all test development me goals

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,519
the model programs and extended a

178
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,110
most have been destruction there are at
least in the beginning this desire

179
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,350
October actress

180
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,320
just basic boilerplate code pit

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,380
with the boss one of you sis we

182
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,050
reinvented a row now testing framework

183
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,599
mostly because if the reason is to set
that the

184
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,510
things that are bare brick time and I'll
to effecting

185
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,140
for use cases so

186
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,519
though what I've one of the big things
is that the test cases a pretty much

187
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,360
this that binary is that but are wrong
then

188
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,649
Mexico kinda tells us about his escape
for our

189
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,990
a success or a Warner

190
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,029
I'll tisch to make

191
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,370
code-sharing easier in reduce the
boilerplate

192
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,390
we have a sack if fairly nasty seem
Actros

193
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,600
that Canada give the entire task a
zamora

194
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,420
decorative appearance its example

195
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,880
normal test cases told you I i gt main
block

196
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,040
that contains katie kinder the option
poor saying

197
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,490
which integrates with with for example
the pic let us run a

198
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,779
the pic a test run only ever runs one
stop test the beach binary

199
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,170
so that the contract were sold
separately then you have a like and i gt

200
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,099
fiction tax book a

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,570
block which is only wrong if the test
cases actually wrong

202
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,269
we use that 0 our queue at the poor man
uses

203
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,720
mean stop teen be able to and in rates
trust

204
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,329
cases all

205
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,649
on the scenes which don't have into
graphic so we need to block out all that

206
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,529
that the whole tray set up a test case

207
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,680
I'll the things you they need that for
animation because me wrong

208
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,029
the binary generates up tests i the
reason for that is kinda the

209
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,079
the law thing we have a lot of
commitment or real sup tests

210
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,380
they maybe you have a print print their
flight for mint

211
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,060
thing which region used you can use to
it to stage together this

212
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,790
the self-test name from flax words some
other you

213
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,029
yet some array

214
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,660
and so we actually need to run the test
binary teen to get up to

215
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,490
les types of tests and there was kinda
what would be the yeah

216
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,100
developed over the past year we had also
have a law

217
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,370
a set of our magic macros like

218
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,100
ITT require at the bottom I should you
require

219
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,790
automatically chance at a the SOP test
then marxists of test result escaped

220
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,579
this then i gt aSIRT which are

221
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:25,589
I'll fails the test case if if the
condition fails

222
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:30,110
we also have like the interest warns and
because I'm too stupid to in grid

223
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,160
Boolean algebra so there's also a
escapar member

224
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,500
has success on yeah

225
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,889
II screen it out she met too many times
when financed

226
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,000
when reef acting all the test cases for
that

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,310
infrastructure

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,930
yes out that's kinda wanna talk about we
have these Mac matching macros which

229
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,769
John bat F

230
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,800
of these days special see

231
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,300
I'll blocks they also bird-like if you
like and i gt requiring the

232
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,479
in the picture in the pop while its gets
the entire is paying

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
if you have a and i gt requiring a sop
test it

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,579
just skips that's up past which is and
if you have like

235
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,949
and i gt require in between to sop test
it

236
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,800
it's kept everything the law which is
fairly useful the case

237
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,769
all their platforms all the sixth and
kinda new features for example we have a

238
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,910
command submission rings

239
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,290
I that now a days it's like four
different ratings

240
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,680
so we just have and i gt requiring each
one of them against

241
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,029
just skip all the new ones that's going
to have any

242
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,139
yeah having used the thing are we also
have our

243
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,250
up the main block we have simple test
case block if you can about how this up

244
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,199
past

245
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,800
it's just kills one I'll one

246
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,939
on chest level at the

247
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,040
the only kinda bad thing a sense late
its it I should you require a night

248
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,290
cityscape or

249
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,839
reply to exceptions and

250
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,839
exceptions and say he means you have to
use set jump and long jump so

251
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,110
all stack variables

252
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,639
in Maine function frames that contain on
shitty fix you right she tell ya

253
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,670
subtests blocks will get scrambled by

254
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,430
chases say so that's Canada ban said but
otherwise it

255
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,079
oxley the ex fairly nice

256
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,899
all the next face it kinda help
infrastructure is all

257
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,089
forking a test hole percent rats

258
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,709
I it's the kernel most of the box only
happen if two things are three things

259
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,060
are a lot of things happen in parallel

260
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,029
a me ft cases win this for four King I

261
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,209
test children

262
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:56,029
and if you forget ass children and the
test ruling has like and i gt acid

263
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,310
art that the main threat really throws
that I judy hassen forward say

264
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,790
that's that's kinda the point behind
those and then we have a

265
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,959
another set of helpers for for for King
backtracking

266
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,180
toss are for example a

267
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,370
if you want to be something nasty to the
system in general or to you test cases

268
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,990
in the background

269
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,490
all we use those and Bandai at the end
of the test case to scold them

270
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,839
and moved the reasons why we haz that s
that

271
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,889
are let's see I has a nice race between
the four

272
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,600
and this the signal handling Weerasinghe

273
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,540
because it caches that the paper of the
process so

274
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,529
thats kinda paper they were in these
helpers

275
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,889
all yet for example what that looked
like

276
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,519
what but what's that gonna look like in
a test case

277
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,220
the top there's a block where you have a
likeness like I said which

278
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,410
Houston the nasty things for example
just trash a little bit of memory

279
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,089
and then i gt focused the real fast
children thing

280
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,850
which comics like an open mp4 loop

281
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:12,000
so you give it the number of of of
processes to span in

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,510
gets it's like a a for loop from to all
the people seara

283
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,530
all on til less than a

284
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,359
and his exam 1 like i said i gt ass it
gets forwarded

285
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,740
I in the main thread you have to wait
for all the children and

286
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,500
at the and also killed a helper and

287
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,570
the next thing which integrative all
that is

288
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,580
ass exit handlers

289
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,360
as it the subducting

290
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,830
all I mean we've all these process help
raise me

291
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,939
we have a lot of debug FS interfaces in
the capital T

292
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,780
kinda changed assess them week me want
to in on the DEP damage for the next ice

293
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,149
case or if the test see

294
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,980
crashes or something so we have access
handler switch

295
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,600
which are wrong with that except Lipsy
infrastructure in that

296
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,100
when emina signal happen sir setbacks
the reason why me

297
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,770
still moved over to for Chris's race

298
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,690
race because our reduce the signal
Handerson

299
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,720
are yeah evers together with 24 calpers

300
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,679
so if you focus up threat that best
tried to clean up

301
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,090
the stuff from the main threat with it
will clean up all your help a process is

302
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,668
a few

303
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:34,330
forget to the data react: crash trying
to do that and it's meissner used

304
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,699
internally

305
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,789
waves with special purpose helpers what

306
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,150
some of the testing techniques that all
discuss later on

307
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,620
going to clean up internal state so that
the actual test case just say yes

308
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,399
the this special playing and then forget
so bad it

309
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,559
and at the end everything will get
magically cleanup

310
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,149
cleans up there the source code quite a
bit

311
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,669
all and finally this day Salado

312
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,910
boring boilerplate removal stuff sISTAR

313
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,460
dealing with kernel mode setting is
kinda boring you have like 5

314
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,660
IOC posting get a the state

315
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,760
even just like figure out what hot kinda
harvest a

316
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,070
I will we have helpers to trade the
frame of recording

317
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,960
T what you wish for you in the summit
all the size and all that kind of stuff

318
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,470
I'll will yeah also kinda help was
trying to you to figure out about a comp

319
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,780
aggression he say

320
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,940
I want this connector on this pipe
factory that somehow or

321
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,850
I want this pipe in day give me
something that works

322
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,889
Arts is a bass in the bag FS access
helpers because everyone lost him and

323
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,809
then some players

324
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,059
also are option parsing mostly for the
test suite so

325
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:56,090
that the picnic test run it can say
place wrong this soap

326
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,820
test and that are kinda magical happens

327
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,470
bunch of other things

328
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,260
all so that's kinda will be having an
userspace

329
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,419
up we also have at it

330
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:16,900
in over the past two years up below the
infrastructure to carry in all

331
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,049
for bed it testing and validation and

332
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:26,900
that saw the mod said states track i
think i think im present that few times

333
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,760
already

334
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,309
a a essentially what the this is double
check

335
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,700
the hall their state with what the
software beliefs but show

336
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,400
Bay and add two years ago we have to act
with writing state so

337
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,039
checking maybe the VGA connector is
actually connected to the right

338
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,720
pipe and ca2+ cyt over this %uh mix-up
happened a.m. which we don't plan is

339
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,559
saying

340
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,899
and since this year will subtract like
the entire pipe configuration states so

341
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,890
at more pixel bath new pipelines running
that is six bits per pixel rate and the

342
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,740
cast of

343
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,000
all the clocks all the special things
like I

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,860
for example is is is an idea channel
being racked

345
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,469
without pipeline freight CIF earth
things like that

346
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,000
all the internal clock set up is almost
at the internal clock set up

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,690
is track now a base so

348
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,640
yeah how did me can I get there

349
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,140
arming the Merritt said stay checker
essentially has a

350
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,330
take components dominate anyway we need
to be able to reunite at the pool hall

351
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,129
by a state that's left behind by the
phone their

352
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,679
by the BIOS I for false pizza oven can
seamlessly

353
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:49,440
take over the holiday are we need to pre
computes the entire base placed a

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,950
for atomic mates at because one of the
things oh the entire goal of atomic

355
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,539
nights at st.

356
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,460
figure out whether in New conflagration
as possible for torching to haul

357
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,090
which currently camping meet me getting
they

358
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,908
so with these two ingredients we can get
the entire hall their statement you can

359
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,650
pre compute the entire hall pass that

360
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,230
if we use the same data structures for
both things

361
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,520
we can just have a little bit of code to
compare based T

362
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,020
things I'm and that's as i the state
track a simple it says very little code

363
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,908
it's its bomb function with like a pile
of macros

364
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:28,299
that just compare I'll I'll

365
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:33,650
struck members essentially which song
with a few if conditions for special

366
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,970
cases

367
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,520
and its

368
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,158
it's pretty impressive how much crap
that think catches

369
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,570
like I think since me out at the apt AJS
it goes

370
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,460
me meet the it is a ball back tray so
that uses actually noticed that

371
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,720
something went wrong

372
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,260
report the book because most often the
screen can I still buy eggs the hall

373
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,919
mechanic gets along with me screwed
something up someday

374
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,309
and says he added that being are I think
that the top

375
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,480
back trace score point on Federer

376
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,760
at like just that

377
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,780
always so there's a lot of boxing Canon

378
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,440
canceling try to fix them and then in
the next release me out a little bit

379
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,770
more states tracking or level but more
complex in the end then began at the top

380
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,059
spot for

381
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,799
back traces bed that call the lot of

382
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,320
of came home ate setting calling cases
and box in little things big kiss

383
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,059
are be them and if the voters cities

384
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,490
it's just a sign showing at it kinda can
test that

385
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,940
at least not with the resources we have

386
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,289
so that's kinda in cable infrastructure

387
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:57,110
we have

388
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,510
which I

389
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:07,100
Mac comes to do very part kinda our
special testing techniques that

390
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,610
be reducing tee to based on the

391
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,658
on the graphics driver that the first
thing is our

392
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,039
freeway Jamie may mean in graphics code

393
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,270
eventual in the care will be made to
stall for the tape you did they do

394
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,389
something because you run out of space
in the

395
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,240
the it's all active offer objects and we
need to make something or so

396
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,140
and general you can I want to make these
block

397
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,419
at these rights interruptible say that
be if the tape you hang zoning

398
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:45,059
something else is breaking users can
actually I kill the process

399
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,440
which maynes you can actually use
signals to test all you ever

400
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,370
perhaps because many pretty much a
weeping of thing

401
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,770
every call chaining the cable

402
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,309
and eventually ends up blocking on the
tape you so with the yeas

403
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,750
extremely of from a czar just focus
second help with wrath which constantly

404
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,400
sense

405
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,700
signals to the face strong and so
constantly interrupts the colonel and

406
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,909
that's kinda how do you stay up

407
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:20,120
test error arafat at the beginning we
can add that that just live acts because

408
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,469
excuses signals

409
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,110
a law and Gavigan formalized adding that
test cases so nowadays

410
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,459
are pretty much all the test cases

411
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,690
which the something non-trivial have
like to stop tastes once normal one and

412
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,559
the other one this

413
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,658
the one before the signal help pretty to
be

414
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,320
on the kernel a bit more badly

415
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,340
another thing that be made it to take
the

416
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,289
see to can exercise at the kernel fully

417
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,779
I saw have been to divest know all teen

418
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:02,190
today so painful thing because jam
supposed to be faster laced Inc

419
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,279
to come and submission parts so we have
an entire Cascada

420
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,760
think three-fourths sometimes fall back
spaus

421
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,010
with a false path which can it seems
that everything is they are already

422
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,820
nothing needs to be faulted then

423
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,889
and bennett than an entire chain of all
back pass

424
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,490
and you can you can test that pretty
easily by

425
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,630
by giving the the kernel a point to
which you know

426
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,260
doesn't have PTZ at on beaches

427
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,960
the doubt played by handing it I one of
our own buffer objects

428
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,080
because maybe we could me know about a
lifetime's if they think that the page

429
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,770
folding behavior

430
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,049
that the very first thing every every
every jam

431
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,039
IOC bosses like pretty full the entire
thing so we have it the biggest knock

432
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,570
tube is able back so that we can still
reliably

433
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,879
test all the slow path than before lack
of the slow path to recovery

434
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,020
I specially communication code is
extremely mad about that stuff

435
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,789
and me up some gay Boxing Day

436
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,289
some what's up well box of the of the
kind very

437
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,289
lyn is tall walls kinda hates me poet so

438
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:18,850
those are kinda want to avoid all

439
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,449
another thing which is fairly recent

440
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,990
eyes that this place year sees check
sums that

441
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:32,440
the holiday has all I guess that that
all the guys is Apple validations the

442
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,600
has a and massive pile

443
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,399
I'll little checks on a UNIX

444
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:44,770
that you can use to grapple a checks in
with an entire frame

445
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:50,340
a different app points and the expense
that perry did I got class with a little

446
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,100
bit of logic in the colonel said you
just tell

447
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,789
tell that the back for saying I'd like
to get that had the CRC check since for

448
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,179
despite this year to say

449
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,789
up with this pipeline and it figures
that out the problem if that this

450
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:07,929
or why we can any quite a lot of clean
logic is it

451
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,409
its interrupt them so it needs to be in
the kernel and

452
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:16,110
depending up in acted conflagration you
need to select different app points for

453
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,539
example on on Bay trial

454
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,899
but if this play pool with you need to
select the best player poor top point

455
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,309
because the normal pipe

456
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:27,918
top point is kinda this able and their

457
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,250
I don't think we need to be there if you
if you like use this by Paul

458
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,789
pop points obvious by Paul this scramble

459
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,049
the output signal to to avoid that

460
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,399
interference I so we

461
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,620
we sat at the box office and then in the
rat is in and this bipolar output

462
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,610
today sable that scrambling to drive
this play poured in a non-standard way

463
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,779
too so that we have stable writing
checks sums

464
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,850
restart this ground refrain so

465
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,699
essentially it's is supported them all I
put some platforms

466
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,370
on on every generation we've ever seen

467
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,489
are tech you

468
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,600
writing task cases with that paying as
all

469
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,020
is a bit a challenge because you can
actually I mean she yelled for example

470
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,059
you ran this something then you read
back the pics one check whether it's

471
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:19,510
rather

472
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,908
graying you can't the damage CRC's the
only thing you get is like this

473
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:27,799
the check sum up the entire frame so the
only thing you can there is

474
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,210
create a frame Graham it's a year say
trade in all the framing compared it to

475
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,380
frame so

476
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,610
aidid that equal will then not so

477
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,199
have you sent for testing for example
you you make the entire screen white

478
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,659
and then you you ran the red black Kors
I can you move it won't pick slam

479
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,500
if the if the CRC check some changes
then you know

480
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,529
pickers this being this play and if it
doesn't change you know the girl has an

481
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,260
off by one they were in

482
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,510
cuts the charism 1 pixel wrote or to the
early of

483
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,029
and that's actually bach be happy orab
we

484
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:12,020
me also want to use that for am sprites
for it for me to this by kinda to check

485
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,360
way to be positioned incorrectly between
draw the entire background frame

486
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,100
in in a collar and then stand it's that
bad like

487
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,699
a hole in black and that puts the the
video frame in the same colour on top of

488
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,200
it

489
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,770
and if that's still the same CRC then
you know the caller so the same

490
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,260
and the polls a perfect that many can to
check

491
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,760
positioning precisely can move it won't
pick sloppy down the left and if it

492
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,059
doesn't change in I

493
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:43,820
I something if the scaling are so I
screwed up

494
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,010
so thats will be currently writing test
cases for

495
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,870
on a essentially live cystic test the
entire came as a PRI

496
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,029
they've carries a place man

497
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,419
framed of a pixel I have it I offsets
and all that stuff

498
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,929
all areas maybe have nasty box but

499
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,450
landing ones once we get there

500
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,840
Iveco a key in all this though

501
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,740
idea beef before we had like this this
place year sees that was all things may

502
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,740
be relied on their

503
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,740
essentially users reporting regressions
when we broke things again

504
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,740
so now we can all tests that spend a
nice

505
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:34,010
so yeah that's all

506
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,049
we can test now if the CRC tech sums

507
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,279
what one thing is framebuffer
compression which

508
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,710
historical has been always bugging

509
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,159
when he may use frame-up compression it
was always kinda case we miss the screen

510
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:49,460
up

511
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,230
they then just seeing the old state in
the compressed framebuffer

512
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,549
and it just kept on scanning at that
instead of well

513
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,820
in about evading compressed framebuffer
end and re compressing air

514
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,908
so now we have a nice test case in be
actually I have proof that it's still

515
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,360
broken

516
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,379
at the same as I with the especially
these higher est.:

517
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,720
display panels K power frame-up
compression actually isn't

518
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,690
TK this saving memory bad they think I
have stuff so

519
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,720
maste panels especially for mobile
platforms have like an onboard

520
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,539
rainbow for on the only uploading you
frame that when at something actually

521
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:32,990
changed

522
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,559
and otherwise the panel just scans at
from its own frame buffer

523
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,389
I'm face the same problem if if you miss
like a a screen of Bay

524
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,590
you you Kors is never ever gonna move so
we have test cases for that now in

525
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,730
thing and it's kinda broken I'd like i
sat

526
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:56,460
placement of curses plane sprites all
that stuff for tation and mirroring

527
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,840
that's all things that we can now fully
fully test in an actor made it why

528
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,970
so makes me really happy as

529
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,049
maintaining up the other thing which is

530
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:14,340
i think is fairly interesting as as the
chief you hang man

531
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,439
something when she actually house since
two years now

532
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,289
on the breaks by a senseless stopping
command submission to haul beso

533
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,769
we still do all the processing mean read
okay although

534
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:30,600
office me we we fill in the ring buffer
but we don't all the hallway that

535
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,668
something changed

536
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,640
which means it looks like a cheap you
hang but it's not actually cheap you

537
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,019
hang which has the upside

538
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:41,210
that basin which I chance the system
actually so biased that

539
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,220
reset double follow aren't

540
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,140
at the beginning cheapy reset

541
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,419
kind that bank occasionally if you buy
locking

542
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,640
bed thanks to keep you hanging man we

543
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,039
are fixed can whistle box

544
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,450
and now a days we also have a a lot of I
mean at the beginning we just had like

545
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,529
the basic test case a mess something to
the hall that if the cheap you hangman

546
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:07,559
activated

547
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,060
wait until the kennel notice that the
homie then baby anything

548
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,828
resets the che PU a that crashed boxes
and

549
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,720
have we had bad locks or locking issues
in general

550
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,009
things that wasn't properly reset
nowadays we actually have like

551
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,399
cheap you hang his versus something else

552
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,168
for example he noticed that if you are a
cheap you hang at the pending page flip

553
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,819
the actual it bad law

554
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,070
so we have a test case for that and i
won that their legs always affects

555
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,190
let me know it is okay if you have a
cheap you hang at page but on the merits

556
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,190
set pending

557
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,300
then be bad luck again so over you we
have a test case for that and

558
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,119
fix the Bakken the care and all that I
and then the next thing was like cheap

559
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,609
you hang versus were suspended miss you
make and there was some bad luck in

560
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:50,239
there and

561
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,469
Mimi been playing up things properly

562
00:34:53,469 --> 00:35:00,270
so now a days cheap you reset actually
banks based on the software side

563
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,369
and I mean sapiens or extremely

564
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,849
hang happy pieces uphold their so

565
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:12,470
having reliable cheap you reset suppose
really important for

566
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,700
a somewhat based user experience

567
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,118
so that helped a lot nowadays on me i
mean people

568
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,560
if you wouldn't yell like crazy in to be
messed to please report this

569
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,680
and supply the error state public
building

570
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,839
are I don't think people have actually
noticed that

571
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,710
an axe

572
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,210
said overall

573
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,290
what's gonna planning to the for the
future

574
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,790
one thing we currently can't really test
at all

575
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,339
are crazy happen devices for example
behalf okay supporting the in the in the

576
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,070
Intel try

577
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,140
bit like know when has a full case

578
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,589
agree well maybe there's one developer
he's a full case screen and Q has one

579
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:05,810
machine which occasionally runs with a
fork a screen can

580
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,680
so we have like no pass coverage at all

581
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,629
so or or 3d support which also happened
all these try or

582
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,460
10 bits per pixel at Petes support for
for

583
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,490
up professional workstation based light
panels and got that all that kind of

584
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,180
stuff

585
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,129
week you can test the scope ass and
there's a lot of soft elastic them

586
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,450
bail Smith the zappa conferees even
before you you see a pixel on the screen

587
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,609
there so what's things that can go wrong
so the next

588
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:40,819
paying goal for testing techniques for
me

589
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,420
is all I want to be able to inject

590
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,740
arbitrary at the congregation's EDI days

591
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,020
all and kinda fake all all the thing

592
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,200
which is outside of the connector so
that we can tax

593
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,960
a full case a poll insane at a EDI these

594
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,540
the media at the poor semen could be
tested like that

595
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,570
by injecting all yes likely corrupted

596
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,260
things I'll all the special pipe
configuration stuff that we need to the

597
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,980
fish special best place

598
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,200
and Mary stuff that I piss we have our
are fully

599
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,000
dumb pipeline so we GA obviously doesn't
have a back channel HDMI doesn't have a

600
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
back channel

601
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,030
this play pool has borne so that would
require a bit more work to do to really

602
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,530
fake and at pope

603
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:35,089
a display port sink so that's probably
going to be the second step

604
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:39,290
but yet that that II was to test the
nineteen new classes

605
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,290
a box in a fully automated way

606
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,900
base also all multi5

607
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,180
multi-display Powell support this as a
very big topic Amy

608
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,720
sins Ivy Bridge you have like three pipe
supporting the kind it doesn't pay

609
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,118
I slept or be at least you really do
that breaking at the case

610
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,910
it's a pain to test with very best place
so one of the goals here is also teaches

611
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,529
in check

612
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,560
three in this place that is suitable for
for promoting pipe

613
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,790
promoting pipe competitions as task but
it's the way X

614
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,410
said oh that's kinda testing technique
from that that

615
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,149
the next big thing I

616
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,300
the other thing more in the
infrastructure bailing make that cable

617
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,200
night setting interfaces

618
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,720
who real pain there's an awful lot of
boilerplate Keef public caning

619
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,410
selecting like the opera competition at
the actual Wong please

620
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,990
yeah hurry requires tom zhe of

621
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:44,078
stupid boilerplate code so I hope it can
now

622
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,290
come up with a better helpful library a
beer a

623
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:52,050
interface stay tuned to me writing test
cases simpler

624
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,650
and easy pro in combination with type:
injection

625
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,140
porn that with injection

626
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,240
train wrecks though so that we can say

627
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,250
I'd like to have three days placement
that just make it happen somehow

628
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't care how but do you check the
menu select real this place

629
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,790
and the last thing is kinda pipe dream
of mine I mean

630
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:21,220
all this testing areas pretty much in
tall own life

631
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,819
and non up the other beer and drive is
kinda

632
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,690
have in the glimpse a uva item made a
test say there's a bunch of

633
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,310
tools and things you can use to exercise
speeches

634
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,750
but that's all bone by developers cation
away

635
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,420
as China I actually bought today

636
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:47,130
not just compiler so I I'd lost to see
other people join in on the effort I

637
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,260
mean that the entire infrastructure

638
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,730
think is mostly intellect nasty besides
that the itu-t

639
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,890
Diane ITT's always miss tangerine tall

640
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,410
all but yeah I A it looks like

641
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:05,078
other driver teams kinda that have them
the manpower

642
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:11,510
actually make it happen fortunately

643
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,680
on yeah a bunch of links

644
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,710
growing more useful tools for the people
watching the webstream

645
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,339
update LG putos represent sorry that the
pic like paying

646
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:27,029
there's a really mean I should tell you
which explains housing but all the stuff

647
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,869
together

648
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:32,240
and I'll taint to blog posts from me
when this guy I love you if they i'd

649
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,750
shitty infrastructure which

650
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,810
also has links to me I getting started
patties and stuff

651
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,849
i the second while Miss kind them what I
expect for test cases test case call

652
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:43,310
rich

653
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:49,259
for al by 9:15 patches

654
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,190
but they CK

655
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,420
say so many are testing and and

656
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,750
thinking about how we can actually about
a date features with that

657
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,020
blowing three times a few min time and

658
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,980
it's just an apostle is is now really an
integral part of Finance 15r

659
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,800
upping it shows well it doesn't
completely suck anymore

660
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,020
are get infrastructure is kinda K

661
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,200
army not faced writing test cases is a
pain now we have all these kinda magic

662
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,419
macros

663
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,339
positive I opt for help resolve to help
with paying so you it's much more like

664
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,970
this

665
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,328
you can actually concentrate on driving
your test logic and trying to understand

666
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,060
the book which

667
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,069
very often is an interesting learning
experience because

668
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:42,750
you have to book fakes and do you think
you understand the Bakken you try to

669
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,109
break a test case notice have no clue at
all

670
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:49,990
which this happen are shockingly often
so

671
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,270
good get infrastructure to help assist
is K

672
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,609
locally can also be using pigment became
like

673
00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:00,430
reuse quite a lot from them bigger

674
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,529
graphics community on

675
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,170
protesting currently graphics driver a
thing

676
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,490
the bacon saying currently and ongoing
to the future s

677
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,509
coming up with testing techniques
actually

678
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,810
like provoke box run through that

679
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,020
that the co pass that you wanna test
because

680
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,819
along I be a homemade pie was a lot of
the stuff is just goes out there and

681
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:30,509
there's a pace I'm kinda made to create
a faint back

682
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,240
I path T yeah

683
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,410
make it possible to like for example the
Best Buy Sears

684
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,759
face or that the cheap you hang man how
can me

685
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,010
hang or fake it's a few hang

686
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,200
wave the five killing the entire box

687
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,410
and that kind of stuff say all

688
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:57,410
questions

689
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,779
are this Mike yeah

690
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:11,780
ms oh yeah his first in

691
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,780
yeah and that's you mentioned GP you
hangs

692
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,339
and obviously read resetting your GV use
grades

693
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:24,650
as a workaround but golden Tigers to
about to keep you from the first place

694
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,040
right

695
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,759
well when possible yeah well

696
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,940
the thing as I mean cheap you hang of
this can be just a colonel parker we

697
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,000
miss the bitter end

698
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,859
but some it at but very often it's like
this

699
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:44,990
like six at bikes are you use a space to
scratch that

700
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,040
but the kernel notice that at that's
actually

701
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,470
nowadays the blurb in dumping that the
mask is like

702
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,578
you take you hang and then like an
entire paragraph

703
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:59,670
this could be a userspace book
explaining exactly where to file it so

704
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,579
that we can officially reassigning

705
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,960
that that was my questions so it went to
get rid of G

706
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,049
you backed with a new Jeep use a good
workaround but I was wondering if you

707
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:08,530
had any

708
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,119
infrastructure I mean for people to
report to hang so that you can use to

709
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:13,910
get them to

710
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,339
fix it are yeah I mean it's

711
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:22,069
we have that since quite a while
actually I think reform yes

712
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:26,279
RB I faced with don't that the tape you
state or

713
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,680
at least interesting bits and pieces
bunch registers to

714
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,098
the ring both Chris and the thing we
suspect was the bashful for

715
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,170
occasionally guess wrong i mean you
can't bomb

716
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,250
the entity gigabytes we dump that in the
debugger face now is a speed bump it as

717
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,250
a block violent this is a fast I'm the
mask policy like crap

718
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:50,480
dad Greg shaking his hair will be calm
like sixteen megabytes of memory of a

719
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,130
cheap you hang happens then

720
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,010
okay thanks that we have that

721
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,119
I'm the mask explains to the user wrap
this file go to the free desktop

722
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,609
books a la file this book against Intel
the RAM

723
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:09,430
and me get them um

724
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,720
in the very beginning to talk about you
constantly gold

725
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,919
& Rubber Co them first maxed and their
also

726
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,260
max preps for them external we do for
testing on

727
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,119
by twin sister today are you getting but
for clues only are acceptable

728
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,130
now re-testing history man things are
prepared to

729
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,460
for you member testing it for arm

730
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,030
the we have a bunch of I have a bunch of
crap

731
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,130
patches nowadays and q aces somewhat
limited so they can't just breath test

732
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:40,930
one branch

733
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,930
so I have like my local integration tree

734
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,529
very thing get pull together and they
have like the nightly runs

735
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:54,530
oldest is a separate

736
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,079
branch for and patch low for fixes ok

737
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:11,079
so fixes get fast but thats wat 0 that
that the next lowest for faces

738
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,329
bug fixes always a get fast track to
meet with you not going to stall them

739
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:17,140
for like a month

740
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,680
now will you get your stable Patil's
like the entire

741
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,839
up

742
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:31,020
I don't think I'm being here we

743
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,619
got that we have to fix only you don't
see all the patches you shake dat but

744
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:37,900
can I don't say

745
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,200
but yah I mean one thing is also because

746
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,240
due to the one week they're lying for Q
a

747
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,799
are features close like one week before

748
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:53,980
at least one way before the match window
opens which means

749
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,730
but by the time I actually have like all
the crap in the nation Mitchell enough

750
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,930
for me is like the easiest time I I

751
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,759
of that this the release cycle the case
everyone is busy but fixing

752
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,910
daughter people spray kitchen know when
reports the ramen and 15 bucks

753
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:15,410
I V actually nowadays we don't have team
any of all regressions

754
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,759
up

755
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,660
effects I didn't people have done a good
job writing

756
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,118
test cases in reviewing at

757
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,099
more the comment the question you
mentioned the other

758
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,790
other drivers in the kernel other
graphics drivers to jump and i gt or use

759
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,650
his testing and I want to emphasize that
the across checker

760
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,170
that we've added to I have a teen driver
to check the

761
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,210
what we think we're programming too hard
reverses what their hardware actually

762
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,450
has has just been tremendously helpful
not only in getting bug reports from

763
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,308
users

764
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:56,790
but its its super helpful for new
development

765
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,430
you know for example 5 developing some
new display future or

766
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,000
adding I export for new platform all
that cross-checking

767
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,140
just catches almost everything before we
even get upstream

768
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,890
so I I highly encourage the other
drivers to upon a similar scheme where

769
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,720
you've got a

770
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,930
a set of State pitcher that you're
tracking and software you

771
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,000
you check it against what you read out
from the hardware and then

772
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,069
report a a complex at that point it's a

773
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:24,920
its really a pic feature yeah I mean

774
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,890
we the state checkered like I i sat its
essentially these two features false

775
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,400
the pin Tomic makes it a bit trying t
make up an upstream but

776
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,059
attain that that little say function
with

777
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,660
which this compares to structures is

778
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,210
is really valuable for the ball

779
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,880
but he added the problem is you think
the other two pieces to make it happen

780
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,740
if you don't precomputed statement track
it like in a separate bag destruction

781
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,308
don't have anything to compare if you
don't have a halt men read at

782
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:02,829
code yet the other pieces by saying

783
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:07,200
I other questions you mentioned

784
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,819
making the driver that this case is also
have other drivers but look at it to

785
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:12,380
keep you

786
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,540
estimate very much so with humid year

787
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,920
in to keep you in every when and that is
why I picked up a few

788
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,940
that this which do quest check the

789
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,920
wall I mean obviously apparently they
all work on Intel chip it tells me

790
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,470
we're not going to write test cases for
Raven or something but

791
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:36,649
all as part of allowing every own quat
wrong test cases

792
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:42,040
or and numerate test cases on that build
infrastructure revoked all the tests so

793
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,950
you can run them

794
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,339
on any machine and the proper escape and
I think that most valued

795
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:51,630
be in the in the kernel mode setting
tests

796
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,799
at least kinda the generic just bashing
things the

797
00:49:55,799 --> 00:49:59,359
and I heard that rating has CC register
stay

798
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,049
cell I guess they could expect that
medicaid that a little stream library to

799
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:04,430
you

800
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,490
to like trade friend office and grab
CSA's and then we could share these

801
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,618
tests

802
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:13,510
there like they have the same problem
with

803
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:20,180
the case aka drop off the screen 1 pixel
to your way so

804
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:26,549
okay thanks

805
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:31,760
on sons

806
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,560
okay time we at

807
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,040
laid in earth basically hitchhiking on
the

808
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,490
Qian's infrastructure of the clothes
first level so

809
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:47,080
the FTSE were your thoughts with other
that's correct but the

810
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,680
a the as he can publish them

811
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,779
and just get passed without intimately
the

812
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,500
yeah that I mean I didn't tell that
story but

813
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,120
getting permission to the exposed to CC
register this was all

814
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,220
long long fight with the homie nice

815
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,580
and I can pair can get and Vega

816
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:15,580
yeah I mean that the thing is the dog
actual hot miss them

817
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,700
I think all the guys mostly use a bit I
mean to have liked them

818
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,089
actual CRC model with that the
coefficients so that they can actually

819
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,090
take me there

820
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,680
one picks less accurate the only thing
we are alive today is like compared to

821
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,470
friends for

822
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:33,240
people are not equal so did in the
liveliest exposed to CRCE

823
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,259
in that they tells test by case the
register and that's also how we expose

824
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,640
it to rate the back of assets

825
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,790
I think five the birds because that's
the merriest

826
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:49,310
any platform ever bombs %um ok usually
its last

827
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,410
its kinda strange resplendent so

828
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:57,330
yeah but it was a long fight to get this
year sees

829
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:04,330
into up sinker and more question

830
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,259
it then thank you Daniel

831
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,410
I suffer %ah

832
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,770
the next presentation is going

833
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,040
the to be about in
