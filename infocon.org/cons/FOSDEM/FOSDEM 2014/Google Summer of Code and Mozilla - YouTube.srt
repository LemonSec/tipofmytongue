1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,879
up stood

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:10,879
deployment the relieved

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,340
ok.so

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,948
for now let's talk about Google Summer
of Code and Mozilla

5
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,080
welcome in the room um

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,320
so it's gonna be presented

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,410
but de Veras and throwing up

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,829
so general rose is done Mozilla's

9
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,710
expert in legalities a real real

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,840
expert you can believe in me he walks

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
on public policy governance community
peacekeeping

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,079
bugsy lower security and she is tough
but also lease in seeing and trademarks

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,370
and in fact anything else is ends

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,129
find to do through all the all

15
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,480
his arm working on the web SEC ops

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,979
as a month-long by eels and
administrator for much less but he's

17
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:06,640
been shown

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,990
in Google Summer of Code A and he is
also the founder and the lead developer

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,759
up in standard so Mozilla asbestos
debated in the Google Summer of Code

20
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,360
every year since it started this torch

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,470
will review what mazzola as gained sure
of

22
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,939
a few successful projects and explain
the great opportunities to participate

23
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,000
for boss

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
students and Montero's so bully is
welcomed evers and trial

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,669
thank you

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,829
okay so

27
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,220
thanks have interdiction player we'll
have to talk about

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,460
much less but ship at sea pensions and
of God so first

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,169
let's explain what some of clinton's
assault

30
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,210
a quote from the Google Website some
rough cut is a global problem

31
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,520
but %uh first post-secondary student at
no cost edges

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,000
18 and although depends what's money yes
that's money

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,649
don't have money for Boston right but
for values have been suspended

34
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,030
software project so this is like

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,970
a description former not and eagled
exponents him up with little bits not

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,690
Burgas

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,200
exactly nixon so

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,519
you run in flight so

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,310
ma specific any further drop us this
means that you will be can

40
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,209
as did answer would be connected with
Montreal's to write code

41
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,440
farts eight weeks during the summer so
missus eight weeks with everything in it

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
right for

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,129
okay so this is a rough cut which one is
better pitch

44
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,390
not into this ourself but claire has
already done its of business on Sep

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,470
as home a late to the son of a program
I'm going on

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,330
however some of president in 2006
farmers in organization

47
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,489
FA to get in 2007 but my project by then
selected

48
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,569
and in this sorry I wouldn't trade you
too

49
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,819
just a projecting an issue like it the
project what he's done well

50
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,230
and as pass edits tonight and then
meeting this month in a community we

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,909
have for this

52
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,040
for those who don't know instant bird is
a missile a platform-based

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,409
instant messaging application I'm I was

54
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:22,269
month ordering last free health I helped
out

55
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,269
administrator last year I would be
honest with officer not how

56
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,480
I I'm jet I've been doing Missoula stuff

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,940
since early 2009 mike is ringing

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,760
am I think

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,190
I think it's mine yes

60
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,329
I have a loud voice I've been doing is
our stuff since 2000

61
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,470
%ah and I beam is Alize Google Summer of
Code administrator

62
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,170
since the program started in 2005 or
they last year and this year I been

63
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,238
handing over to Florian

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,319
I'm entered three projects in 2005 2007
2009

65
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,909
I did too in 2005 neither was
particularly successful we learnt a

66
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:07,739
great deal

67
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,640
about what makes a successful project in
the last ten years

68
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,170
I am and yes as Florence said and I am

69
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,370
in the process of handing over now

70
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,250
some numbers for you in 2013 a 117

71
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,870
difference free software organizations
participated in some rib cage

72
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,979
which involved nearly 1,200 students
from around the world who in about

73
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,380
seventy countries so the program has
been getting bigger and bigger

74
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,190
and if you multiply 1,192 by

75
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,810
5,000 you'll get an approximate size of

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,910
at the the main component of the budget
for the program so

77
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,320
very generous a Google since 2005 the
been seven and a half thousand

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,159
successful students all may be that
successful projects because sometimes

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,500
students come back Andy

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,840
multiple projects mean over 7,000
mentors II

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,929
from 100 countries and summer Kate
students have written over 50 million

82
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,699
lines of code all I'm sure it is true
variable

83
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,340
quality I am firm is a list perspective

84
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,820
we have had a hundred and seventeen
students I'm

85
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,250
a few min 99 past which the past rated
eighty-five percent

86
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,840
at that is actually pretty much on the
average

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,609
at least for the 2013 average pass rates
press organizations was

88
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,520
eighty-six percent so am we've we've had
to

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,889
you know eighty goes up when it goes
down but you know we seem to have about

90
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,970
the same number of students passing
failings everyone else

91
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:45,060
in 2013 at 21 students up from I think
about maybe 10 or fewer in 2005

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,650
are you can see across here and we had
about the same number students each year

93
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,940
for the first to give seven or eight
years and then the last two years

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,229
I the Google's been expanding the
program or they decided they like a

95
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:56,960
small

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,979
all we've had more goods projects I'm
not quite sure what combination it is

97
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,449
abuts at the number has has risen
significantly

98
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,590
which course requires more
administration work which is where

99
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,818
for incomes in and 2009

100
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,199
was an interesting year we had quite a
few students fail lightyear

101
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm 1 one student an

102
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,139
disappeared off the radar after a week
and reappeared a month later saying

103
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,819
yet sorry I had a major car crash
psychic

104
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,850
and that was pretty much the end of his
participation with a two years later

105
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,669
another student said the same thing

106
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,560
and I started to think mean yes

107
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,930
they like to get just give me the money
and I'll catch up in the second half

108
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,710
it's not what you know it's very hard to
tell if someone is actually been in a

109
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,830
car crash or two

110
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,909
going to visit them in looking at that
bombs and scratch marks

111
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,210
anyway and that's that's roughly the
shaper

112
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,448
how it's been K

113
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,500
so let's not talk about who can
participate

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,720
first talk about let's talk about the
students for again

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,680
cooking good website to occur in fact
qualify as a student

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,710
it to be an individual on run all in

117
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,380
are accepted into an equivalent
institution including

118
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,840
but not necessarily immediate to
cottages invest it is must for programs

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,750
PhD programs and decorate for crime rate
programs

120
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,900
you mister Herbie energy been to
indigent watch

121
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,380
in the country in which you reside
frighten the duration of the program

122
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,780
so this means if I summarize need to be
a student

123
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,169
and even to prove it and you need to be
able to receive money

124
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,340
now I'm under those criteria

125
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,810
hands up in this room if you would be
eligible to participate

126
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,720
in Summer of Code as a student in the
year 2014

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,629
excellence there's at least 25
applications such kits

128
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,960
yeah Craig

129
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
now so yet all the people who put their
hand up please do you seriously

130
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,989
consider applying okay Nextech let's
look at

131
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,259
who can the amount of so month of
Ramazan a

132
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,110
need to have been millions for wine back
while me a projector interesting

133
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,250
if we have known equipment in a would
suggest a pain for another organization

134
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,419
for project

135
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,068
so vehement in should be ok in this from
my guess

136
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,889
have a good understanding of the code
area: on a table heard back from him to

137
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:21,900
her project

138
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,620
a person to know what you're doing about
this if you want to have invested in

139
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,900
and you need to be willing to commit to
looking after student Federation other

140
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,969
so much

141
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,519
said the definition of code and is
slightly flexible we've had people doing

142
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm example code for the missile it
about the network

143
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,309
pure documentation project aren't
allowed nor appeal cue a project's

144
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,439
but the unit is a it doesn't have to be
a.m.

145
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,600
you know something deep-sea plus plus
hacking there are inning

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,950
there are the some flexibility that now
I'm

147
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,940
hands up who in this room thinks that's
there is an area code with in Missoula

148
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,420
for which they would perhaps qualifying
as a summer of code mental

149
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,550
a sea of rice and what he said about the
first love Everlight now I'm not getting

150
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,890
better

151
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,500
okay few people is interesting actually
Anna

152
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm yeah well that we get

153
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,459
okay so let's not talk about what you
get by participating

154
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,859
so as a student of course health some
money

155
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,850
that's interesting but I'm hoping it's
not the only reason to consider them

156
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,140
often

157
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,380
saw what you get apart from germany is
among talk indicated to helping you

158
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,439
and her is holding on to will help you
first i win and to defend the project

159
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,410
to be sure but it fits the return of the
son of gun is the right size

160
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,579
is something interesting that people
want to hurt you with

161
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,839
you know so I had to get up to speed as
soon as possible

162
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,510
which means for example that a win and
you understand the

163
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,060
places to submit patches to get reviews

164
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,699
and and so find the right to inspect all
work well for you

165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,440
so get an efficient workflow they will
get you in touch with the right people

166
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,540
so for example within months enough for
some projects when not

167
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,920
only be touching caught between and have
been discussing user interactions

168
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,290
is on her face so we have use expensed
in with people but we want to talk to

169
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,349
in some cases you may be secret
implications you would want to talk to

170
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,620
security people

171
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,980
and the montel will introduce you to
this people because you contest guess

172
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,010
who they are

173
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,959
so the nikkei site security said this
secret

174
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,939
not checking and of course 300

175
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,500
duration of Osama not only provide
advice and feedback

176
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,730
so we will never get stuck from so

177
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,610
basically if you are thinking of getting
involved with getting more seriously

178
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,850
involved with the free software project

179
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,370
but find that prospect a little bit
daunting or difficulty don't have time

180
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,950
summer code is a great way cuz not only
do you get paid for getting involved but

181
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,019
you get someone

182
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,380
his job it is to help you get involved
so

183
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,610
I'm it's a really grates on RAM if you
like for

184
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,390
proper free software involvement which
can lead on TV many other great things

185
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,060
including fun and profit

186
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,619
now let's see what it looks like from
one host so yes he is

187
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,170
you get a student focusing on a project
to care about for moderation in the

188
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,149
summer

189
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,649
but used as a think about investing in
your community and this is a great way

190
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,329
to train

191
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,800
new community number last and its when
he come in but some of the students

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,099
become noncompetitive Utah's even if
they are no longer pay enough to be in

193
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,890
the summer

194
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,189
just and should working with you if you
do a great job as a mentor

195
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,870
and it was there on for years and even
consider being a month of it and the

196
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,920
next Hills

197
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm not sure really common is we get
people who do that every year

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,459
but people's involvement post summer
code does vary

199
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,290
it's not uncommon it's a it's not
uncommon yes

200
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,769
and assault a it's a personal growth
opportunity

201
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,110
because you have you gotten treatment of
someone and

202
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,149
developed a month during skins a not
just

203
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,620
at one point in time but doing it from
iteration over some not so it gives you

204
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,600
time to improve

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,139
if everything's not perfect immediately
particularly in a

206
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,519
organization with already seventy
volunteers and

207
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,100
ambitions to have so many more
volunteers that mazzola does

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,540
if you're a missile a community member
developing mentoring skills

209
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,510
and the ability to you help people along
the volunteer role is a

210
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:36,180
really really useful skill to have and
summer code is a great way to do it

211
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,388
when they're going to give some examples
of success for some of God's

212
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,680
project we have had in the past so
affected

213
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,519
to protect we'll just talk about on the
new international I think it best to

214
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,570
because they are not

215
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,880
obviously wanted to very popular mounted
a project so

216
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,200
when just wanted to show that a project
doesn't have to touch my of folks

217
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,630
a Firefox OS so for example whether
student doing great work and hungover

218
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,310
he improved me interoperability between
Jimena Navarrete

219
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,290
Hampshire plenty of people really happy
about it this far

220
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,599
another example what happened next
series where the student doing a

221
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,649
prototype implementation for it should
be

222
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,279
to over some implementation that was the
first working 7 condition:

223
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,899
which is a great help to people trying
to implement plans

224
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,829
and discussing the specs and now we are
going

225
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:27,060
to show primo visible projects

226
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,310
for which we can do a animal

227
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,250
so at this was a project from I think
either 2012 or 2013

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,760
are which was mostly Donna Summer of
Code and then picked up polished up and

229
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,310
checked into the tree this is the
Missoula

230
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,979
networking dashboard he go to about
colon networking in for in any copy a

231
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,190
Firefox

232
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,940
you will find this I'm it shows you I'm
all the open connections supports their

233
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,949
own rooms

234
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:55,880
bits about the connection what host that
to you on this information about DNS

235
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,720
requests you can't buy see the whole you
either but up in the top left hand

236
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,540
corner

237
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,560
and all sorts of things I even get it
all to refresh

238
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,310
and you can see who your browser is
talking to you

239
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,920
%uh another projects did some very
interesting

240
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,110
pits all I'm coding for the Missoula
develop a network which is

241
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,750
our sites for helping people learn about
web standards

242
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,990
a witch everybody who writes a shemale
CSS and JS should use and tell their

243
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,980
friends about

244
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm we built somewhat difficult CSS
generators which a little kinda webpage

245
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,689
widgets that help you design the CSS

246
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,110
visually for some particular affect you
want so this

247
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,680
there's a new CSS properties is a
trickle border image which takes an

248
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,449
image

249
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,120
and splits it up a a so that's

250
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,480
and you can make a border agitated said
having to do manual image slicing and

251
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,339
having a top left corner middle a top
right corner and so on

252
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,220
you have one image and then use the CSS
to make splits

253
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,889
right so here we have all sorts which
it's a controls you pick a suitable

254
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,980
border image style image government

255
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,240
on the left and then you fiddle with all
these and as you fiddle

256
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,010
the I'm this is the appearance the
border changes until you've got the CSS

257
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,810
right

258
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,589
and and then you copy and paste the
generated CSS from the box

259
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,630
the bottom and you're done and is a
similar one for border-radius: where you

260
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,939
can kind of dragged until your box looks

261
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,209
just like the top right in top left
corner zav something galaxy s3

262
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,638
and then you'll be happy and M

263
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,660
yet assumption galaxy s3 is like the
first smartphone

264
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,990
ever designed by lawyers if you look at
it you'll notice that the top left and

265
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,790
top right-hand corners have a different
border-radius:

266
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,290
on the X in the Y and they again have a
different border-radius:

267
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,730
to the bottom left in the bottom right
corner is and the speakers Apple

268
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,360
has a patent on black rounded corner
rectangles

269
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,940
anyway change CSS box shadow generator

270
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,370
on this there's a box here and a few

271
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,170
are again is it would help we'll see the
left of the screen you can add book

272
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,219
shadows to it

273
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,310
and define how far out they are what
color they are and so on and so forth

274
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,949
I'm all with kinda beautiful color
pickers in graphical drag-and-drop

275
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,290
this knots I'm and then copy and paste
the CSS from the bottom

276
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,269
anyway the last when I wanna show you on
the next tab

277
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,630
am is and probably the most visually
impressive

278
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,680
summer Co projects that we've had thus
far on

279
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,000
and this a I think it's better to show

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,279
am say if you press the right button

281
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:39,279
it yep that one min yep pressler

282
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,849
this is a great way a figuring out how
web pages are made up on what problems

283
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,579
they may have with their boxes and
they're stacking and that kinda things

284
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,269
is called tilt

285
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm and it's a 3d web page debugger

286
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,509
I'm even in the 3d view which eases Open
GL

287
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,839
you can still selection nodes and do all
that

288
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,389
substandard Dominic relations on them
from the Firefox developer tools you

289
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,780
could when you look in the web page in
2d

290
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,539
I'm and so you can also see how the the
layout the patient is this is a Twitter

291
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,410
time line which you can see has a

292
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,530
reasonably clean each construction if
you do this on some old school HM how it

293
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,990
will look

294
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,990
ugly and

295
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,329
so I flatter and ugly and

296
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,649
but day going so I'm one died did this

297
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,650
in eight weeks which is pretty darn cool
to be honest

298
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,100
at so officials are about what we've
done in the past have some of

299
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,449
but it's a nice and cool but I think I'm
more interested in

300
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,840
what we can do in the future so we are
not going to talk about

301
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,250
participating in 2014 at this partner

302
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,870
and this time we are currently
conducting project idea soul

303
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,340
we are predicting right now ideas proper
take but

304
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,750
other month also if you are considering
applying at participating as among talk

305
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,000
you can submit ideas

306
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,840
on this wiki page you don't have to
compete for your own right now when

307
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,280
make sure it's is it to get it later
don't worry and you should try to find

308
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,940
ideas

309
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,950
but oh well man sized for eight weeks

310
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,120
of work from a student and we can
sometimes help you understand if it's

311
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,429
long enough ought to shock known and it
can be for

312
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,810
any minute a project sold candy for
Firefox of course Firefox OS for for

313
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,250
some great but I'm so far

314
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,790
for a number of points on bob point SS
for bugs in our

315
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,600
all any government in a project you can
think of and

316
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,530
that but the thinnest israel needs to
have them on top yes so

317
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,920
every year and and this is why we have
the PC a brainstorming page

318
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,070
and there's another official page with
the ideas that we think I actually

319
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,800
credible

320
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,040
the first year we didn't have that
separation and people put all sorts have

321
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,690
you know I would like it if I folks did
this or something on the list but with

322
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,510
no idea about how long it would take all
who would mentor it or anything like

323
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,900
that

324
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,730
and then students applied for those
ideas and we have to turn them down

325
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,350
because we didn't have a mentor and it
was a ridiculously

326
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,600
inappropriate project and that's really
not fair on the students

327
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,149
that you know you kinda suggest that
this option might be available but then

328
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,430
it

329
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,970
really isn't in a pulley effort into
writing application yeah so we don't

330
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,590
need anymore

331
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,980
instead we have to bring something page
and to get from the brainstorming page

332
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,300
onto the main page an idea has to be the
right size

333
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,490
and it has to have someone who is
willing to mental

334
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,720
its so if that's you great

335
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,590
stick your writing it down orson if it's
if you're not able to mentor it

336
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,370
you probably need to find someone who is
all who is willing to consider doing

337
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,610
that before putting your ID on the page

338
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,020
because otherwise it's really not fair
students and we can copy it

339
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,550
onto the main page okay

340
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,399
and service was about fall opposing
project now for

341
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,980
playing as a student so of course missus
assuming when I selected again as month

342
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,320
ago

343
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,970
organization bagel because this edition
hasn't happened yet for this year

344
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,470
nothing you need to do is rainy

345
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,670
discuss the project idea with amount of
us the front playing

346
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,520
because it will help you ensure that you
have a correct understanding a project

347
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
and between when he had to improve the
point i'm happy occasion

348
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,430
and so keep in mind the dates so

349
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,370
she ever program starts only on during a
previous yes you need to apply between

350
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,500
March 10 unmask 21st and

351
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,740
someone buys for students to increase
your chances of being selected

352
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,080
soul with really encourage you to send
more than one application

353
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,899
because every year we have a situation
where there's a popular project

354
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,930
and recency one great applications from
excellent students and

355
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,110
we want to take more than one student
Belmont of israeli

356
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,419
so well enough to turn on some great
application just because they are over

357
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,020
gratification for this project

358
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,550
so your edges where a risk are being in
this situation if you apply for more

359
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,480
than one project

360
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,620
Eagle now has a limit to five if you can
write fight good applications that's

361
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,030
good

362
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,030
but you know maybe three is the right
number maybe yes or

363
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,350
you probably don't want to send moment
reputations to the same organization

364
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,929
yet with risk being seen as Spanish so
try to focus on credit to rely on

365
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,790
quantity but

366
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,580
try sending moment one and something I
really like to suggest a student is

367
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,879
apply for one of your on ideas its

368
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,780
way more exciting a student to open
something you put on yourself

369
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,100
much on its and still have less
competition

370
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,580
its own idea I would be the only one to
paying for it so I'm singing it's a

371
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,379
great idea

372
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,390
2008 improve your chances but

373
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,980
keep in mind you need to have a montar
and finding amount of money on a

374
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,860
damaging it and if it more difficult yet
this is this is where

375
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,459
often South proposed ideas fall down
even if that correctly sized

376
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,510
inappropriate for some repair project

377
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,500
if I mean when we get ideas within a
good ideas we will go and try and find a

378
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,330
mental for you

379
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,720
but we have a big pile of things and
there's not much time and

380
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,320
if you propose it and say and so-and-so
has offered to mentor

381
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,320
that makes you application for you I'm
project much more likely to succeed

382
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,900
okay I'm not going to take questions

383
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,550
leadership

384
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,409
up

385
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,670
up okay so the question was what do I do
if I'm a student and I don't get on with

386
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,610
my mental

387
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,770
and the answer is a you come talk to us

388
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,070
and we deal with each situation I

389
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,960
on its merits but it is extreme I don't
think I've

390
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,850
ever had that happen that students and
mentors have completely fallen out

391
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,679
in a week all work together kind of way
i mean students sometimes just

392
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,210
go off the radar and stop communicating
but thats you know

393
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,540
and the mental tries to encourage them
but they've they just kinda given up on

394
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
the program

395
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,070
but II I've not really had to kind of
separates to

396
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:21,070
warring to Warren participants in the
past Corp

397
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:30,550
here help

398
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,899
um do we give the question is do we give
additional credit to all kind of

399
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,930
look more closely at applications for
people who've been before

400
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,960
and I think the answer is generally no
each application is

401
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,700
assessed on its merits for that year
with the resources that we have than the

402
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
other

403
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,080
policy the other applications and so on
and so forth I me if you come

404
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,419
and you've done stuff and then you
disappeared for 10 months and to do a

405
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,910
thing and then come back and go only to
another project

406
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,370
that might actually be in a sense a net
negative because it's clear that you're

407
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,389
actually interested in being involved
with Miller use on the money

408
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,710
on the other hand if you'd come and done
it and you carried on

409
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,150
then probably lots of people will know
you and you'll be unknown name but it's

410
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,410
the fact you are known name in Europe
community member the gives you the beast

411
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,140
not necessarily the fact that you did

412
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Summer of Code youthful other questions

413
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,140
call why you say into preaches about
three months on the Jesus website

414
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,830
at the G-seven project you said it takes
weeks

415
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,220
addicted coding period I believe is
eight weeks

416
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,130
but the is not run was it 13 weeks this

417
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,710
okay yes you've got longer last year

418
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,260
but even before that it was like 10 or
11 weeks okay

419
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,330
a skits is get and I think it's now 13 a
delicious as long as Google's

420
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,639
that the coating here it is as long as
Google says it is not as long as we said

421
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,200
okay okay we do not have an extra
special short coding period from Zara

422
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,660
anymore

423
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,320
what makes a good mentor and like you
know what is a bad mentor was a good

424
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,879
mentor what's the difference

425
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,920
Korean so

426
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,420
investor would give to mom tells is
first to get English invested and as

427
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,890
soon as possible

428
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,720
and try to get vested in to be involved
in the community I to not

429
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,270
treat the student as if it was owned by
union contract are but I just went well

430
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,790
just

431
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,659
mister dunne to everybody in the
community get this done to talk to

432
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,480
everybody

433
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,670
and gets on track as soon as possible

434
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,460
as it was a regular contributor and not
just someone paid to do some work on

435
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,390
some stuff

436
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,950
so I've noticed spring for your when it
was among top but

437
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,270
we get much better isn't if we get this
done to

438
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,720
submit small but she's at the beginning
over cutting pay other even defined the

439
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,130
Community Band and bonding pay on
because then they will already be used

440
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,530
to submitting patches to help people
watch in this community in this team

441
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,190
and something I would give us advice to
Montreal's

442
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,170
is now but I ain't especially like and
we have done it is

443
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,790
give the students a very small project
for example in a

444
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,470
something that you would do yourself in
when we can but of a student would be

445
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,500
for two weeks for example

446
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,670
an see how they work and this on had
been things are watching events

447
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,240
and if you can get them to come
contributes correctly

448
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,550
in two weeks something relatively small
with that touches the same queria

449
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,580
as it would be touching nato then they
would have or but own

450
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,790
and to get started quickly when it's
happening billion

451
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,050
I doubt something else as well which is
that for cultural reasons

452
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,649
some students particularly students from
certain areas in the world

453
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,230
are reluctance to show who other people

454
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,590
code which does not work perfectly

455
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,010
and the tendency to not show codes until

456
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,500
the student believes it works perfectly
is absolutely

457
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,380
disastrous for some risk a project and
therefore you need to buy coaxing to

458
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,000
Jolene we dealing

459
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,910
I'm promising whatever you have to do to
them

460
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,960
am persuade them that's they need to you
show you that code

461
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,430
and that you can comment on and improve
its help them move in the right

462
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,060
direction

463
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,750
where the issues from because the whole
Big Bang patch at the end with a week to

464
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,920
go hey can you please review this now
I'm done

465
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,320
almost always ends in complete disaster

466
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,110
so a good mentor does not allow that
leader

467
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,419
in the last question is on was to
success

468
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,610

so it's getting better and a the
possibly

473
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,699
I its you know it's because the numbers
are so small variances are hard to say

474
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,610
St sickly significant I mean eighty-five
percent on average
