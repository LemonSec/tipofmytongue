1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,758
thing no for couldn't fisting if these
seems like a

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,400
very interesting discussion okay great

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,639
fill my name is Martin pets today

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,520
I'll talk about the state a bit itself a
nation I'm am

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,250
have been elected as one of the
directors this year and

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,109
I'll try to introduce you to what the
foundation is about

7
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,289
and I'm and went well changing right now
information

8
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:35,800
several I'm just saying this because
this is but I think the

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,279
condition is a non-profit corporation
chartered to develop and execute

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,950
effective strategies that provide
worldwide

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,289
to it said and encouragement other X
Window System

12
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,770
and related projects which are he's idea
I well and so

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,140
just to be clear it's not only about X

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,649
its bro did not so Antipolo goes of
course it's

15
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,680
XE bi its TX so limits because we have
no logos fall

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,130
dr. I and he said is Janet's guess

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,310
and Wayne and as a little while you

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,479
okay so

19
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,610
the foundation is not about I providing
technical guidance

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,630
offense perhaps need to %uh for

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,890
I'm creating road maps all deadlines
releases

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,549
and %um no supervision at an
inspirational

23
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,549
what he does is providing communication

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,320
architect all tools where in relation
with a protest up

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,529
a it also provides an annual physical
meeting

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,810
XTC X developer conference we'll talk
about that

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,030
the next line and provide money to help

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,310
the demand the government uptown traffic
stack Saudi XD cortés

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,310
I think now we are through the the XTS
will only use XTC

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,619
but it used to be XTC thought that the
young

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,740
US version of the year XTS

32
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,020
and X yes will be in your in Europe
somewhere

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,489
dis attain a 10:18 a.m. I

34
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,239
yeah so when he had seen US one and
you're in Europes was being

35
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,849
we have a load-balancing in and

36
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,179
78 once again usually in september or
october

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,599
and it lasts for three days settle for
this conference

38
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,060
okay maybe for first-time I members

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,599
of course they need to present something

41
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,599

entity we can be brought up the some

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,260
I Google Summer of Code so im we've been
working on approved I

45
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,790
organization and this allows students to
be paid by Google will fall on

46

several my student I'll

58
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,319
was 72 as a has-been reverse engineering

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,958
performance comes as amended your cards
so as we can

60
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,099
I on tell developers application
developers what is wrong with the

61
00:03:59,099 --> 00:03:59,790
application

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,829
and why they are hitting about to make
this kind of stuff so it's a lot of work

the implementing GL

68
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,840
X thank state access I so far the code
as not

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,310
the on it pastor all

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,550

kinda like a

74
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,580
kind of like that she suck it's called
the ebook unless the cation of code

75
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,080
so basically I am it's not but with some
it can be any time %uh yeah

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,270

but so

79
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,130

82
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,139
Francisco Torres who worked on the

89
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,690
up until test two piglets if you know
what this is otherwise it's a

90
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,710
testing architecture we had more but

91
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,380
no place on the slide and

92
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,610
we also provide communication I said
before also

93
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,870

in with the phone which is nice so as we
can. updated

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,930
in case community several

112
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,180
now let's talk about the current a
situation with membership

113
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,190
and members of the board and all that

114
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,690
so what is a member sOooo

115
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,449
its people actively engaged into the
community

116
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,030
and community so tell guidar

117
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,270
the whole Lambretta not just X and XI
for

118
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,409
and it is someone who is so

119
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,389
supporting the goal of deformation

120
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,530
and a of course they need to sign the

121
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,669
membership agreement so

122
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,770
as a member if you become one and I
suggest you do

123
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,799
I you connect the members of the Board
of Directors

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,819
and you will be. consulted

125
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,190
when the board is trying to make big
changes to Don

126
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,080
the foundation so for instance changing
the BIOS

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,878
a change in the corporate state status I
dissolution

128
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,840
up the deformation or unusual agreement
that would make

129
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,270
this year will have below changes and
corporate status changes so

130
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,878
Pelini's applying the country seventy
nine members

131
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,460
and if you want to become one tests

132
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,390
I well you get the URL for please do

133
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,059
okay the book I so the best directors is
composed of

134
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,130
I eight members every year where you
reelect

135
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,740
from you people so in 2012

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,920
we had collected next to each other
Keith Packard

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,829
mad do and much esubs so exposure is

138
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,089
working for AMD key is working for

139
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,019
Intel Matt is not working on something
that is

140
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,769
song created Matt yeses I'm

141
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,839
a professor in Germany

142
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,300
and that's yeah I mean while last year

143
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,329
but so I think a business is

144
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,850
working for Oracle a has been elected so
Peter

145
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,990
I working for Red Hat and is now the
Secretary of the Board

146
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,160
stewardess is that treasurer and I think
he works for Oracle Team

147
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,810
and should be good and I'm not impressed
summer peaches units in a

148
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,149
in bordeaux so

149
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,690
the schedule for the reelection is this
one as

150
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,490
all day a nomination period opened at

151
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,800
well last month thirteen-a of January

152
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,630
so basically it means that if you want
to become a board member

153
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,750
you apply your you just apply

154
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,380
and and you have to pull some rules that
I explained in the the link below

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,110
the nomination period answer have to a
month

156
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,459
so some then we'll a make it public

157
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,750
so the reason why it's not public before
is because we want to allow

158
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,829
amend candidates to retract

159
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,959
without it being public it's not to hide
anything

160
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,500
some some if you want to have the

161
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,560
elect now if you want to participate in
the election

162
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,319
you need to applied before done 1905

163
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,459
so piece duvet bow

164
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,189
the section opens so on the 17th so

165
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,329
Gavin day for the lab and it closes I'm

166
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,459
well three weeks later some

167
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,689
please apply as a candidate in if you

168
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,260
nine-member up tons of invasion

169
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,689
and I get

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,600
so so far no questions it's gonna be s
shop Talk sorry

171
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,480
okay could corporate status year

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,209
and okay as for the formation as the US

173
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:15,380
IRS 501 c3 status so what does it mean

174
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,890
it's the US a I'm not-for-profit
organization

175
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,029
sewing pins that if we get the nation's
me

176
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,810
on the donor's don't from have taxes
don't pay taxes for that

177
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,768
it means that we don't pay taxes to yeah

178
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,500
and well it's mostly irrelevant for
non-usa donors

179
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,390
so most of us here

180
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,860
so who i am. getting the status has been
quite however

181
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,399
so it was decided to get in 2005

182
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,209
I we got in 2012 and retroactively

183
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,888
got it bad to 200 that 2010

184
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,990
9 yeah I so we gained the status thanks
to the

185
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,160
the wake up their softer freedom though
senator well who went with them but

186
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,389
they did a lot of work we must this
status for a few weeks

187
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,300
in 2013 because we didn't I'll

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
published that we had income we fed them
I suppose he would have

189
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,319
the people would but the didn't so we
had a mishap in communication

190
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,279
for continued bad SF LCT managed to get
it back

191
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,240
so if you want to I'm numb the full
history of what happens if I don't

192
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,240
you can I look at Howard down
secretaries bus than that

193
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,459
so many situation is so

194
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,359
we have a lot of money and we can
worship I

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,920
at the current rate weekend last fall I
for 25 years

196
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,889
without requiring and fundraise

197
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,240
we've been living on nom on our funds
for maybe 10 years

198
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,850
up I mean I mean you members so I

199
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,680
yeah I've always known the formation as
having money and not

200
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,380
I'll requiring fund-raises

201
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,490
Saturday why the mishap

202
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,490
with SA a chase BC baby basically
changed the rules

203
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,190
and should on no account very
unfortunate

204
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,029
with the have the money but yeah so from

205
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:32,360
the past the fact that bad they used to
process to pay a thirty dollars p

206
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,540
every month for basically doing nothing

207
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,040
and the fact that the while the website
wasn't that good for money transfer than

208
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,949
all that

209
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,439
subtle we just moved to the bank of
America

210
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
I'm was yeah it's easier now apparently

211
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,579
and that treasure

212
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,370
it should be cheaper to good it should
be cheaper

213
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:05,370
mister from the old

214
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:08,740
some beacons will not account since then
the Wii

215
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,260
apparently bad me

216
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,510
by this status is not something that we
need anymore

217
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,470
at the time in 2005 it was needed
because we need to get a lot of income

218
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,500
I we don't need that income anymore so

219
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,600
yeah it's an earthquake so it's a the
technical achievement apparently

220
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,209
I wasn't there but they've been
struggling to get it for seven years so

221
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,279
I guess it's

222
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,620
quite an achievement I am

223
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,529
yeah but it's not it's not a problem
proven itself

224
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:48,930
so as as I said we are not US
accountants

225
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,040
I said US because well we come from
other one around the world

226
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,000
and and as we don't get it as much money
as

227
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,510
we use to me it's not worth being funny
countenance

228
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,149
and in the end it's just easier to I am

229
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,649
move to a number to corporations such as
as a full CR SPIA

230
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,089
I will talk about as the I am in a bit

231
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,339
and so I think manage demand the money
for us

232
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:19,430
and a you feel all the paperwork for us

233
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,750
skip so we booted

234
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,529
at XTC flights SPI I the reasons why
they should be public

235
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,519
um mostly because it cheaper

236
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,769
and bad will be conducting yes FLC

237
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,709
and I'll and spik and bend

238
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,739
when everything is ready for that and
the transfer then we require

239
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,480
a vote from down to members as I said

240
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,750
before all members should vote when we
changed the corporate status

241
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,959
which we are going to do

242
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,268
so SPI what is it I Satan

243
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:03,339
the nation infrastructure basically so
they manage on the money to bank account

244
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,100
and the taxes earned all the paperwork

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,410
that he can collect money from anyone in
DC you'll speak

246
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,850
didn't do that before we usually are and
the weather had two companies

247
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,850
was easier an intern day you get to keep
five percent of all the donations

248
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,360
SPIA is also handling our genetics that
be in for desktop

249
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,759
LibreOffice and Drupal and a few others

250
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,079
can't remember but couldn't be blessed

251
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,359
so if it's good for them must be good
for us right

252
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,889
in then as we need to

253
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:47,160
I as we want to move to SPIA we need to
change the BIOS

254
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,100
settle because the findings have been
returning and

255
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,490
OpenOffice in 2006

256
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,600
the russians out quite difficult to see
differences and all that so I put that

257
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,470
bad to

258
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,089
latex and I get so as now we can put
Tigers and feed

259
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,720
commit things in so it's good

260
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,809
a some and as we are going to change the
BIOS and changing the bylaws require

261
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,480
both

262
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,400
from the members it's a good time that
we say that

263
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,539
thereto conditions not only about eighth
it's good to know

264
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:27,539
talk about the right way and me sir this
kind of projects

265
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,370
so we would but that into Dom

266
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,639
the binos so if you wanna see the

267
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,330
the vision and the the conventional
version of the BIOS

268
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,590
I think there are two branches the
master one is the current state

269
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,500
nobody take it no medication it's a
sporting the open offer document to

270
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,710
8a and those in SPI a branch that is
just about as PI and no changes for the

271
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:57,110
the I'm changing the will

272
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,399
the the changes for changing the scope
have done

273
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,410
the foundation but on the wiki for all
intents and purposes

274
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,870
the itself a nation is about every
project

275
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,510
I'm yeah weight and tax and everything
and a

276
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,169
okay so as a conclusion you should
become a member now

277
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,530
when the GOP in very thin I

278
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,260
pizza become a better candidate I
brother

279
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,490
um yeah so you have about

280
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,049
15 days left far a plane

281
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,750
getting better than improve the
communication this is something we suck

282
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,190
at

283
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,440
and we should keep on working on it good

284
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,700
and to keep them coming on improving the
graphics back that's what we do best

285
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,190
any questions

286
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,660
I have am him right sleepy

287
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,679
am so you x.org foundation maybe he
spent seven years

288
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,240
getting this 501 c3 status and then
dropped a bit

289
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,470
and another sided don't need it anymore
at all

290
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,840
yes why is it still there

291
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,770
wise exhort still there wyeth is also
why it's now a graphics that woman

292
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,910
objects orbit room

293
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,370
for you may not know why is the x.org
foundation still valid

294
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,439
all it did was create this his new
status

295
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,580
and that was it days bases

296
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,600
we have elections 10

297
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,830
he well as a as i said it's easier to
get

298
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,110
and to be in the in the G some program

299
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,189
if we are on a reorganization we could
have when for SPI at the time I agree

300
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,429
and for the reason that have been said
to me because I wouldnt

301
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,200
I wasn't there before sure that for the
board in general not only yeah

302
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,380
as so the reasons where that we use to
get its

303
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,620
100kg I year

304
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,010
so of course Intel if they could not pay
taxes on that

305
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,549
Intel and other companies out yeah I
don't know who was

306
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,710
giving us money I'll of course they
would

307
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,460
be my or willing to the money also maybe
just put a little more

308
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,980
so at the time it made sense that's what
I've been said

309
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,440
min and now a we've been living off

310
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,909
what we had I for quite a while and I

311
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,280
think yeah I i mean obviously we don't
need that status

312
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,690
now a so

313
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,159
so minute one less thing as a corporate

314
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,020
a thing it's also easier to organize the
XTC

315
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,658
rights own that's just yeah reinstating
itself there

316
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,929
me yeah at this point it might be better
to have it be there

317
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,539
the open-source graphics confederacy or
something

318
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,340
way but wish all me what you wanna

319
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,500
do you want to have some kind ever other
thing

320
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,820
right I would he want to have some kind
of a thing to

321
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,500
for organizing events for participating
in things like

322
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,720
like gee sock it's probably not as
important as it was

323
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,500
arm right

324
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,950
but I mean use you still want to have
some some kinda love

325
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,220
and organization that can that people
can point to

326
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,980
but but having it be

327
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,710
eccentric and in may be happy he

328
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,600
well well it it is but a it is the same
as

329
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,360
has the vestiges I love how

330
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,049
how X was organized right i mean that's

331
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,330
it has history to end in n

332
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,299
and and maybe I all has a sad hey

333
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:52,320
mysteries late got cancelled but he
didn't

334
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,320
1 yes I'll also that he should answer
this

335
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,510
are but I mean is you still want to have
you still want to have some have

336
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,490
always with me

337
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,549
get get the mic otherwise in no one will
hear

338
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:19,730
I don't I'm really happy to be changed
three you your four years ago

339
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,980
and finally started doing I point out
everything was completely close the

340
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,059
meetings were just

341
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,299
some people on the phone and was it so
now everybody can only see you know

342
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,908
that's already a good change and

343
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:35,350
now apart from that one artiste

344
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,230
meetings about usually what's to see
what the status with the

345
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,130
501 c3 more when are the elections
starting

346
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,360
and that he saw and XTC you need both
can

347
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,428
I mean I put everything in the print
edition about what we doing

348
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:56,059
a bomb hidden yeah for so yeah

349
00:22:56,059 --> 00:23:00,230
but I before to be more open your you
doing gonna put but

350
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,679
everybody should be more vocal about
covering all project with with the old

351
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,280
name because it's nice Europe

352
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,230
keep yeah I was interesting in changing
that

353
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,039
interested in changing the name but it's
not something apparently we can do you

354
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,070
and some people lower love having you
know one letter

355
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,270
good tonight at European its lame

356
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,570
but I I had similar I'm concerns to look
for a long time have been like what is

357
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,990
the board do all I hear is

358
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,059
I hear stories about how they care pay
their obligations right solar

359
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,340
what are the functions at the borders to
arm help pay for XTC

360
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,120
and get people there writes a sponsor
travel and

361
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,459
some people will will get travel
sponsorship dot com

362
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,960
and then that foundation fails to pay
them for like a year

363
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,929
you know which is be our yeah they don't
get the money to the venue

364
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,950
let that happen in Australia to which
seems like just the absolute failure on

365
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,220
the boards part which is really
frustrating but on the other hand I

366
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,000
think we do need an organization to

367
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,240
receive that funding and and manager
properly

368
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,770
ideally so I think there is a role for
the board there

369
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,580
but obviously yeah I agree you've been
there there were some issues and that

370
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,649
was before your time

371
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,380
yeah but and yet so maybe that's why as
I said we are not the countenance

372
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,909
and we usually don't like it a in with
the FBI man

373
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,360
moving to SPI would maybe make it easy a
and

374
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,770
usually we just send money every year so

375
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,760
we forget how we did and sending money
it is a quite difficult because who have

376
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,779
I all the the bank fees and all that

377
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,799
it's changing all the time he doesn't
know

378
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,120
I yet for the reimbursement I got night
fall xD she is and had a difference of

379
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,459
about 130 euros or something something
like that

380
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,620
just in bank fees want yes so

381
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,270
money working with HPI really just nicer
and I'm

382
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,350
there

383
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,719
it first question done

384
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,049
go ahead town will the will the move to
as the I change

385
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,429
anything within the the formation I'll

386
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:15,740
processes are the project or something

387
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,929
project know as I said we don't provide
technical guidance we're just here to

388
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:20,450
help

389
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,760
when people need us when developers need
us

390
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,210
that's what we try to do and so it
shouldn't change anything in the project

391
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,980
management

392
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,860
um but it will change the way we work as

393
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,549
the board and I i the foundation itself

394
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:41,600
in does it answer your question no then
did you rely

395
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,139
no from so

396
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,299
to feature I didn't add the research but
a SPI is

397
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,010
but now of course you're you're just
you're moving into an umbrella

398
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,090
organization

399
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,620
and the the only change

400
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,779
the is going to be the Treasurer that's
it from

401
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:03,130
the the pressure as work is going to be
different

402
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,549
so I'm if you want to have a look at the
differences

403
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,020
and the way we weren't you can have a
look at that SP a branch

404
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,010
Inderjit repo this one

405
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,600
because yeah admits the differences and
Howell

406
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,260
we are going to need what is going to
change I he didn't put a Seagate

407
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,240
I link because I couldn't find it didn't
rain and the 3G connection was horrible

408
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,880
so on this one wakes should

409
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,890
leg there was a question there

410
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:40,890
okay great

411
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,970
okay i was just curious um the

412
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,330
fundamental we whether more between say
this of freedom Conservancy specifically

413
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,428
in SBI

414
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:54,730
the just the ten percent to 5 percent
all was there some other philosophical

415
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,480
difference I'm curious

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,260
what that poll a.m. I'm surprised that
we have two organizations that do the

417
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,029
same thing and can you tell me what

418
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,409
you thinking on it was who

419
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:10,220
at the top of my head since September
because we haven't looked at it

420
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,940
since yet has since and it really was
just the difference in the

421
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,260
money I as planned to be

422
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,169
i think is gang was there and managing
less

423
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:26,440
I so it's just about money and

424
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,120
I R and taxes that's it that's all they
do

425
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:37,120
I suppose he had mall but I can't
remember what it was

426
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:44,210
yet

427
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,669
I'll it works

428
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:50,360
okay nah two questions actually um for
small

429
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,990
I on any plans to improve the members
that side

430
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,090
its okay horrible right now yeah

431
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,629
know we have no plans so least make this
a priority

432
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,780
confusion it's a horrible yeah here

433
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:13,280
trying to get people into the foundation
and if you look at the HTML code

434
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,030
don't embarrass it was good because I
could count the numbers

435
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,500
grabbing and counting the right now in

436
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,909
30 conceded hmm

437
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:27,120
yeah yeah I agree its home alone but

438
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,530
during rem into you really want s to
maybe

439
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:35,370
pay someone to change that yeah I will
expect the foundation with all that

440
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,239
money that the

441
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,289
at least get their website right this is
something I couldn't submit to the board

442
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:44,408
yeah oh yeah and

443
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,480
yeah with and what the Fed if someone
wants to

444
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,820
step up and fix it it's even better when
you need to

445
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,020
spend money bad I don't know who likes
to do when

446
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,299
development here for

447
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,908
yeah i'm just repeating what he said we
r

448
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,490
how costly program is not web developers
another Gaza

449
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,850
frequent overlap between the two
communities good just pay someone to do

450
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,158
it

451
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,860
and second one a I

452
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,100
thing it's a not that much the
Foundation does

453
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,270
just providing money to the invention
travel

454
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,470
expensive um I would expect the
foundation

455
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,820
to actually be more active than

456
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,439
something like the Open GL armelle

457
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,510
or we have all those great

458
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,710
for free graphics drivers now

459
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,970
new mobile radio on whatever and all
those

460
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,390
don't have fun Open GL certification
because you have to

461
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,460
ideas tests are stuff and

462
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,530
I think the foundation could spend some
money there too

463
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,120
get them those certs a

464
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:08,120
think this would make a difference yeah

465
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,590
yep

466
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,090
of I think new

467
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,330
new can do open feel free both free and

468
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,780
we can't really advertise it because

469
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,629
it's not paid for the test two we have
picked lit

470
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,730
rear all those a Howard

471
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,890
at least that and I think wouldn't be

472
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,100
too much of an effort to you and get the
official

473
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,678
11 can can make it a cost problem

474
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,610
92 in so yeah before entering will give
them a

475
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,408
that Mike 2in because he's been got in
trouble and that certification so

476
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:54,090
so you know better yeah been have been
doing that work for Intel I'm also one

477
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,750
of intel's representatives to

478
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,419
to Kronos arm for desktop Open GL their

479
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:02,530
is know who a compulsory conformance

480
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,899
process or versions previous two
four-dot

481
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,840
or I believe Lalan

482
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,720
there is an optional process for for
previous versions

483
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,020
arm and learn we r are currently trying
to to get some things fixed up so that

484
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,510
we can

485
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,010
we can pass all that are are on our
driver

486
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,260
on so so than anything

487
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,480
at mean you can advertise any person
love desk OpenGL the

488
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,010
that you want and not be technically
running awry

489
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,110
I'll I'll the the krone's process

490
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,399
are this story is quite different for
OpenGL

491
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,710
yes where there is an established
process for

492
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,580
all the versions that the aviões are

493
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,590
and actually not there's anyone from

494
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,120
from him the in in the room messages it
yourself

495
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,459
be get your stuff fixed up and submit
conformance cuz the company

496
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,549
already paid for it for for the other
driver

497
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:05,960
are there is supposedly

498
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,049
a process by which on

499
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:13,120
basically nonprofits

500
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,719
can submit conformance on on drivers
without having to pay a

501
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,960
the usual fees are people have told me
about

502
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,990
that this thing exists in Kronos a
couple times but

503
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,250
I haven't been able to figure out what
it actually is

504
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,490
Musso missouri's because go with it and
you know what that means is that we may

505
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,990
well be able to

506
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,090
get saw pipe in LVM pay

507
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,178
certified as as component yes
implementations

508
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,030
without having the to shell out a bunch
of my are

509
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,059
part part of the difficulty is there's a
buncha weird

510
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:54,090
legal agreements well not weird but

511
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,360
a bunch a legal agreement about getting
access to the conformance tests

512
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,500
are and it's not clear

513
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,780
exactly how that would work and he would
run the conformance tests

514
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,040
in order to to be able to submit them
because the people who do have access

515
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,059
are people like me who are really busy
and don't

516
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,290
one trains ground with operated lol BMI

517
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,730
bill some test okay great now what how
do I get

518
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,890
you know how do I get that to someone
who's actually working on that driver so

519
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,179
that they can fix it

520
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,190
are so there there's some other

521
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,450
sorting up out that

522
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,890
that needs to happen com before before
that can work out

523
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,010
arm and I don't know how that would
apply to

524
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,790
hardware drivers so I don't mean I don't
think that we will be able to

525
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,860
to get a free pass on Nouveau or

526
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,510
for you know on any the associate
drivers the people are working on our

527
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,230
or things like that can you give us an
estimate up the price

528
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,270
but corporate not a its

529
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,379
on the Kronos website are but its

530
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,790
on the order tens of thousands I

531
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,279
I wanna say it's like 30 grand

532
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,090
for ps3 but I don't I don't remember

533
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,090
I did I didn't sign that check yeah okay

534
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,220
I just had to to pass it along to people
who could sign that check

535
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,560
so you had money on a new one in mind
that I kinda responsibility

536
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,639
a mean yeah I think it's a

537
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,109
I mean it's interesting this is
something that I could bring up to the

538
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,949
the blood and I mean

539
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,388
maybe you wouldn't as a member you
wouldn't vote on that because it's a lot

540
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:41,990
of money

541
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:46,939
and if you think that is needed I don't
think knew what he needs that

542
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,119
because its mayeski for users

543
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,139
and users I'm not companies so they
don't really

544
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,619
can as long as it looks good I'm I don't
know

545
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:03,619
I mean way

546
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,440
okay okay and then

547
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,569
I'm yeah it would be nice if we could
just sit down together and write an

548
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:29,569
email to the board

549
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:35,180
because I'm just me forget so forget to
send the mail but just for good reasons

550
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,549
because yeah I don't work and that's a
little okay great

551
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:44,519
something else um so it isn't that slide
with an identity crisis is

552
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,939
prime yours you guys have find families
that it's more than just

553
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,400
he made his England sorry SBK I'm

554
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,519
so you're trying to establish that
you're more than just X that their Mesa

555
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,950
that you are also weighing on everything
do with graphics an important stuff I'm

556
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,149
one of the ways that you can make your
self visually

557
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,299
very visibly as well I'm

558
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:11,240
very important all this on his bike to
infrastructure by taking over

559
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,118
be to stop it or for instance and paying
for infrastructure getting is properly

560
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,200
at no longer user directories which they
don't disappear

561
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,250
or I reporter its hackers something that
would be something that

562
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,630
exhort has the money for the budget for
they could do that and they could give

563
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,200
us good hardware now we can

564
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,970
the panel this is something

565
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,140
we need to discuss indeed but

566
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,069
yeah we have we haven't had the time to
do that because you have free desktop is

567
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:39,509
not

568
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:43,650
that's not aboard no election and

569
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,400
yeah so yeah no accountability in any
way

570
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,609
that's the one thing X or cat

571
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,740
the organization is there and it's like
accountable

572
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,220
once a year bien but that it matters
much

573
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,299
for right I mean yes no I don't get
elected

574
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:04,119
all we didn't get much better ways to do
that

575
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,250
from on you can get you more power now
there's we're almost there is

576
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,420
yeah I'm here yeah it's important then

577
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,279
yeah this is something good

578
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:18,500
and I think we need to discuss that
there are however relation was free

579
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,069
desktop

580
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:23,859
right balcony over love that tho
condition you the plane but I think I'm

581
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:24,460
the only one

582
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,760
can yeah but that's a very personal

583
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,880
opinion not the opinion that the board
anyone else wanna make the fat man run

584
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,029
pack

585
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:40,369
you're allowed to I accept

586
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:43,490
mmm okay thanks very much fun

587
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,439
welcome way
