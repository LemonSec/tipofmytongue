1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,000
the

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,450
ok first good for it quick question for
love you

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,110
grew more human have used the small ok
in the past or are using small bomb

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,000
so I'm going to do some in-depth things
and small hope so

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,680
yeah booty and the people who know a bit

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,119
a small and ice just ask good

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,170
a the video brutally

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,340
I I

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,530
home little he should

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,940
it's a very fun language them

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,699
on

12
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:45,300
I'm Thursday aqui que religion but
myself

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,078
a.m. and while the house alarm amoco
founder of the

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,159
85 a relief for small the company since

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,559
2000 so we've being doing nonstop

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,729
smoking and for almost the

17
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,159
13 years I think the

18
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,399
we in the past we also use the name
cause Macau's

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,490
process I love you may be me remember
that one

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,060
and a in the past them we are based in
Amsterdam and Berlin

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,140
and 85-80 the

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,770
develops a the broad-based skills
management application

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,220
and we the it's a very complex
application in WI

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,650
keep track of the problems people are
trained

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,440
the for all sort of for hiring training
to

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,910
professions the fire departments the

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,509
industrial safety and stuff like that so
in the past be built a

28
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:47,550
you can smoke a code base the which he

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,280
still are supporting me you know what
base their application

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,300
a and

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,950
this say leads us to the bar why we
started actually

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,130
the gravel because we have lots of small
talk show

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,320
and we want to run on Java and we are
not going to rewrite that people's that

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,780
will take many many years and we will
introduce

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,860
many bugs and I don't like Java I like

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,220
problem program in small or chrome

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,410
batteries in the main reason me
currently

38
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,910
are looking away from visual works to
another platform is

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,010
the you want to that includes

40
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,399
movie looks like or support and we want
to integrate bit

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,100
the the all Java library infrastructure

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,920
with all the good stuff that is made out
there and

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,170
so what is rather small though and

44
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,429
grab a small though it says for the
lettuce

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,630
the running on the JVM will them

46
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,640
be given using the me know in favor say

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,078
people than anything you should feel
that this new in the

48
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,620
in Java 1.7 it was introduced by the
theater

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,870
a 292 and

50
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,160
we've tried to develop a rebel small
itself little

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,570
people are looking for a searcher in the
gains follow

52
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,269
no longer linguistically and we have

53
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,450
lots of features like trade names bases
on the fight be

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,890
closures leather do nothing terribly NBC
will look sections

55
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,660
problem and we open source the project

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,040
hungry in thanks to YouTube with your
licensed

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,429
which may be the ok leave with remaining
cheese because

58
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,709
the some people are saying that the MIT
license is better

59
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,230
got I discussed see I'm

60
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,738
we also have some things in gravel a

61
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,879
as clearly have some a few are

62
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,920
coming from a small the world a the

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,799
sometimes it's the you may know the

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,830
become the operator who is this the
operator or two

65
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,159
fishing rival word visual next the

66
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,319
currently we do not support that and
then grab a small dog

67
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,488
and the main reason is performance the

68
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,099
to correctly implemented those who this
man thinks in gravel

69
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,159
small on the JVM would mean that

70
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:20,238
we would lose always be benefits both

71
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,580
the what the JVM can do for us a.m.

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,650
if we find a good way to be implemented
we might see

73
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,890
changes I'm

74
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,409
I'm going to tell you believe about it
would be really journals

75
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,849
I and

76
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,479
first how we actually develop the the
bar

77
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:42,979
the

78
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,340
a in research here also goblet cell

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,849
a.m. we started developing gravel the

80
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,250
in vision worse and we all

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,570
built a particle party infrastructure in
schools ok it's all

82
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,020
and we want to develop the a

83
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,750
the identification system with an
optional type innovation system that was

84
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,760
inspired by six

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,550
the strong talk called the even

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,260
and it allows us to at type annotations
to be to work source code

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,990
and we use their to as transformed

88
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,190
the smoke source code to Java source
code

89
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,540
have a small example

90
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,250
over here the which excellent

91
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,570
around the year scream other medical

92
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,880
method not been poor the selector and

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,409
I'm gonna see if I can move the image

94
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,410
actually on screen

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,000
that we're the both the method mapping
the

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,770
chrome the selected this is the small
hooks forcing

97
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,310
it is annotated with the with those
curly braces the

98
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,410
thank you stations the these are the

99
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,660
for Africa times and these this is the
return type

100
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,590
with you see the picture mapping corneum

101
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,258
the elicit this looks worse than it will
generate this job %uh sources

102
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:26,259
how to fit see if I can get my window
back

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,430
so the we try to develop

104
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,440
as much but the system in small tube
itself

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,590
because I'm doughnut don't like

106
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:46,539
Java the we develop the betting parlor

107
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,600
a.m. with the idea that

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,800
a home in in a

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
injector seal the compartment you would
like to she should be here

110
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,930
when you're developing in a so the

111
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,320
I we will like to use the

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,460
Java objects that come out of the
libraries that we use like that

113
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,500
summer has some list

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,729
comes out of the library and I ever
since ma took over and we want to use

115
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:16,180
that

116
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,190
a release as a real love object so you
want to

117
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,150
I who you'd like to be able to detect or
select or

118
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,299
one of the axon those the

119
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,889
those kind of objects you cannot the
whole cabinet that's all a JVM

120
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,919
and we want to be able to change all

121
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,169
kind of thing so we star do because the
local

122
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,430
betting barter and abetting compiler

123
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,410
a allows us to from the small

124
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,750
respective to and move remove in cheese

125
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,580
the behavior and that's purely because

126
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,130
the views are his who controlled over
the method lugar

127
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,490
so we can decide that some all met with

128
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,160
is no longer valid in from Marseille
gonna spirit

129
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,450
perspective and now a new method for the

130
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,830
different method is but ordered liberty
has changed

131
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,150
this gives us the possibility to chase

132
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,510
the mobile phone in the blue running
stevia

133
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,389
a on

134
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,849
next the to get gravel running

135
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,240
we need a some sort of base library

136
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,860
a what we actually are doing is

137
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,770
we're the recycling the you're using the
SP

138
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,338
eighty third base classes the from sweet

139
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,670
and we're getting those

140
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,750
the source comes from his sweet and

141
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,620
the he importing them in special
packages to be worse and then

142
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,829
the the right

143
00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:01,130
they're all those killed about out
official we're sitting at home

144
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,790
we had a found they say is great but
it's cool that on the big day

145
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,209
its actually the machine-readable form I
hope the whole

146
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,569
school the only summer which describes
the

147
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,730
what kind of protocols you can expect in
a normal

148
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,220
as will the existing and what kind of
selectors should be

149
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,410
a been committed and what kinda be a few
the

150
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,670
there should be we use that to appear to
be generated s

151
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,360
and x3 the we do don't best

152
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,920
the that my and

153
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,160
you see is a very intense over here the

154
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,400
runs with some example values so

155
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,750
this is the is a test for this local

156
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,240
as a bag and a certain kinds of objects
you

157
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,250
be able to the to respond to the
messages like that

158
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,190
things like an important election or
array or a

159
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,430
the other the clicking back so

160
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,599
so values you will a injury over some
example those we

161
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,200
just one more on this later and it
whether the result is

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,089
any being sensible so we don't do any

163
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,780
the somebody that the checks whether the

164
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,370
result is anything suitable exit the

165
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,279
next to a year person but I checked the

166
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,170
but running using is this week and

167
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,829
early boo pretty easily recreating

168
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,459
what is needed to hey bases will the
system

169
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,910
incredible a.m.

170
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,610
and we the what we need be

171
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,280
coffee from 3 we then

172
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,449
the home speed things up a bit

173
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,599
you if the definition the

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,520
is the is part of the tree bark what we
call it

175
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,010
or the actual implementation barnum

176
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,230
Adam because in gravel

177
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,449
but we use the faces than a and

178
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,780
the and we

179
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,310
good in revelry you think that in order
collection

180
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,569
defines something of the public protocol

181
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:22,209
all at the base lively so your
complexion

182
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,680
the be from our view is a tree

183
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,010
and Solan the actual implementation of
the order collection

184
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,120
is do class you looking uses your cell

185
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,459
normally it's an ordered collection able
and that

186
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,359
contains the actual private lottie

187
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,110
for the using is one collection

188
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,120
and the

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,339
or click an implicit default
implementation for this trade

190
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,300
so an important lesson you will you
Nordic looking

191
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,670
and go to the implementation

192
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,949
confirms we and you can also use these

193
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,069
the the streets the we are built to

194
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:10,089
the look at the Java environment and

195
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,390
if we in identified certain Java classes
that

196
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,730
sourdough correspondent correspond to

197
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,430
the for the process then we can the

198
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,739
at the the for example bTW to israelis

199
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,540
weekend have it conform to the street so
late

200
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,990
every YouTube he met with a few lead to
to order click contrary

201
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,400
will be available on in the release that
will work

202
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,140
enter your travel system

203
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,459
home we started the

204
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,109
the development of gravel 18 a October
last year

205
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,300
at this point we have the generated and

206
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,810
like this working me to use that the the

207
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,849
the largest part of the baseline he is
working

208
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,480
so that's actually live because we don't
have the

209
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,890
ago file protocol this working

210
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,079
and that's because the the ANSI standard

211
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,500
a eso very

212
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,970
we're being about follow protocols and
I'm

213
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,680
being sweet and issuers also dumb

214
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,609
cool want to dance the standard in that
respect

215
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,780
we also have for it so much the some

216
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,390
libraries to to test the system the

217
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,290
good the

218
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,699
the

219
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,750
with very little adaptation would be the

220
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,340
you be you moved to passing through our
system can be used as you need to to

221
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,430
reinvest song

222
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,030
got a small though I'm I somewhere

223
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,930
found in the implementation a bill to
move on the on the Internet to

224
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,849
to taken before it was over got a small
boat and I found the

225
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,330
implementation of the Ridgers Bayswater
and we

226
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,870
actually started home the first ideal

227
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,020
a gravel he by TE people's I don't

228
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,199
actually like programming Java now I
also don't like programming

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,550
in Eclipse I really love the Pala
powerful

230
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,939
the the refectory browser 0 using it the
burger

231
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,420
and things like that I'm

232
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,280
so things we

233
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,800
them not bomb at this set point yeah

234
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
and which youth for space

235
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,170
we want to look into trouble a we are
both

236
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,550
7 Mar no you're very interested in the
book business some

237
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,719
XVI is going to do but so does something
we'd really like to to experiment with

238
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,160
because it sleeps like very good promise
to talk technology the

239
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,400
another thing me really want to do
because we have the lecture

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,870
lecture you'll being a very new language

241
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,280
so you don't have to do things like
support in stock

242
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,730
is do something the do

243
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,150
once and for all and that that s cue all
the locals and in a way that I can use P

244
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,939
does

245
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,350
a be good it because

246
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,760
I really like small though but I don't
like

247
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,939
close this folder the but we also have
to do that

248
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,220
get it working is the life you buddy and

249
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,350
problem would life be bugging the

250
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,620
in is the limitations up the JVM

251
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,810
and you cannot the

252
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,050
in an image itself you cannot newly
instantiated

253
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,380
the state for instance you can only
Mozart expect from a look

254
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,250
TV in with your thoughts even poorer the

255
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,860
there are some tricks possible above you
can get

256
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,880
like you going working with the it's
hard we're

257
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,360
the

258
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,940
we're working on that if anyone has a
good idea how to get

259
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,280
really good debugging on the JVM

260
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,350
the I really love to be here and next
step is

261
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,920
the for Asus if we can

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,160
word in gravel itself the we will make
itself hosting so that mean you

263
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,310
the some parts of the code

264
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,239
the for instance the the code that
transforms the

265
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,900
5 annotated compiler small talk to Java

266
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,910
use currently issuers but the only so

267
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,319
if you would the a

268
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,120
some oil change the compiler you can
only be generated

269
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,850
in gravel in cell the the at this point

270
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,000
so let sorta concludes what

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the gravel is today and look

272
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,010
where we hope you'll be going

273
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,510
a this should the like to

274
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,510
as it thanks to well its

275
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,590
both saying thanks to bill the ideal

276
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,110
open source because the we couldn't them
build these

277
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,370
in a few months time if there wasn't
there

278
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:10,619
enormous amount bill I he is freely
available on the net like to

279
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,208
who the small looks weak environment and
the

280
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,810
duties are the stuff and the everything
and

281
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,599
over here no I also like to thank the
the post and people for you

282
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,740
giving me the opportunity to get to his
feet over here so

283
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,620
thanks to that and

284
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,790
I'll give a shorter than demo over the

285
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,360
the gravel small though

286
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,050
will first switch my

287
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:49,050
Motobecane into

288
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,610
does anyone know how to the

289
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,860
get the Mac the to monitor my

290
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,899
screen overhead you

291
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,720
never them the way see that but not over
here on the leases

292
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,070
yeah Jones Creek it's always a modem

293
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,520
who the other the nightmare it's also
not over here and Kylie

294
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,660
tell you with arrangement

295
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,830
arrangement here this place okay thank
you

296
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,060
that's better com

297
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,649
poem

298
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:38,650
I'll get eclipse cool

299
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,360
more

300
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,610
I love this is a agreeable for you boo

301
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,959
the I'll but we're I have the

302
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,060
x1 maven project that contains the the
photograph resources over here

303
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,940
contains the good job code: and the

304
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,030
small the film the because our

305
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,240
actually those coolers are
representational

306
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,040
the picture expected to them and

307
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,570
I'll try to star

308
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:21,290
the web browsing because that's the both
interesting part may head to the you

309
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,480
the to take a look at it like home yeah
I did

310
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,000
it third redline has a different
approach to our approach is mainly about

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,660
speed

312
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,440
and red line is not that focused on
speed so

313
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,640
the so that's the reason

314
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,340
why we didn't go the redline way but he
didn't mention

315
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,480
big numbers I'm I'm

316
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,900
I'm actually been cautious about calling
them and their name speak numbers

317
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,630
because

318
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,900
I don't know how to do official
benchmarks and stuff what is a good

319
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,220
picture you interesting

320
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,570
but those are unofficial numbers the

321
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,460
we have the bill to blue benchmark
running faster

322
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,040
band the Java so we can run the

323
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,010
that though the blue code all the JVM in
small that bastard

324
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,570
then the the Java code is running

325
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,889
the old thanks to the

326
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,670
great hotspot optimizations all

327
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,860
then again PU you also and the

328
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,020
show this problem with the directed
benchmark and

329
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,179
could really performance like like how r
sex makes

330
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,460
really bad it's like 100 times lower
than Java

331
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,840
so a willow

332
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,840
pollution home

333
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,430
Herman scheme

334
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,539
okay

335
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:00,820
I'm running out of time over here I'm I
started my browser and

336
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,360
the browser connects to grab a small
though a.m.

337
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,870
we've built this browser to actually get
a few of the system itself

338
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,100
it so it's a web-based sort of the

339
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,039
browser we have over here unless the
inside gives the

340
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,658
Beckett just and in there you can

341
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:23,830
see you both the classes that have been
implemented

342
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:30,059
bainton few some source code but we
actually can do is

343
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,070
unethical bike who

344
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:39,809
and accepted and

345
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:45,090
typically peers over here as the to so
now I have

346
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,789
at the Met who fractured it's of course
part 2

347
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,000
get some feedback in a system the

348
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,309
when you have no be buying Bourque so
I'll go the classical WEO

349
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,070
the crashing your own I D E so I'll try
to

350
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,270
the I'm

351
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,690
no human the browser application class
and the browser application class you

352
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,419
the actual thing you are seeing right
now and

353
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,510
somewhere over here is a button called
except

354
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,640
and I like to use the

355
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,640
French word for cheese so when I accept
this comb

356
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,860
and it actually accepted my button is
now cool

357
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,870
so much so I change the source code

358
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,928
both the year but the code that renders

359
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,630
the user interface and now the Cody

360
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,130
the Methodist in if he also conceded
that the formatting of the

361
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,450
method is has changed and that's because
the

362
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,640
its know if the sort of the compiled
code because the

363
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,710
be girly don't you right back

364
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,350
the think source code could to be a 60
it's now the compiled go

365
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,399
I'm so that's a yes

366
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:13,229
pre-k bring them all the to the gravel
system

367
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,299
well so far to grapple system

368
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:23,299
and

369
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,890
but some questions will

370
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,280
how many people who work in this the

371
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,428
currently mainly me myself

372
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:43,770
and what a colleague yes the

373
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,860
put in some pics two hours let me in
analyzing the screen goes

374
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,520
the to get it the actual methods that we
have to

375
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,940
move over the to grapple because we
don't do

376
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,500
want to move over all the methods
because the

377
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,520
officials took the source a legacy
methods in them

378
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,730
so we only want to move over the methods
that are needed

379
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,910
to satisfy her tests so

380
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,419
and the so it's

381
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:19,419
I think one of Gotham

382
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,510
some other questions

383
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,350
sooo room

384
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,780
fresh or

385
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,879
them we're planning to have it in
production

386
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,290
somewhere and the the for small systems

387
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,690
a.m. March for things like that so it's

388
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,530
we stood for started this as a

389
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,080
research project deceiving with actually
doable

390
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,320
and all that it seems to be doable we we
will

391
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,490
be using it reduction com

392
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,630
okay thank you

393
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,300
