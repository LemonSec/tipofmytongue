1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,009
so we're we're here in the US recession
and Infrastructure as a Service dev room

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,419
and there is appended

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,480
plenty of interesting talks today mostly

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,059
about how you can I make use of
interesting projects but also

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,270
a good new features in various projects
and

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,750
this took a slightly different because
I'm I trying to address this is a

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,390
difference I'm trying to address

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,689
their upper portion of the room are

9
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:32,130
and and tried to answer if you have a
few interesting questions for you like

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,960
why why would you ever want to continue
to OpenStack way is it something

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,860
what's in there for you what what you do
gain out of out of

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,590
be interested with this project and once
we answer that question we can go a bit

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,430
deeper I

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,010
where where does it actually makes sense
to continue to clean up its act which is

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,269
a collection of projects

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,670
I wipe typeof contributions there is

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,230
for for for OpenStack and finally sure
like

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,640
pretty convinced how what are the first
steps for

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,369
for putting it into a Penn State soda
the first and most important question to

20
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,630
answer is why and why would you ever
want to contribute to a fansite

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,460
I would argue that it's it's because
it's a smart move for fraud ever

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,509
for a number of reasons I'm

23
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:23,720
first or you get at number of companies
that are involved in

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,048
in up in stack today and it's a

25
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,680
quite in significance a cross section of
the industry is represented here

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,740
this is the list of sponsors for %uh the
our last the

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,530
our last Development Summit in hong kong
and

28
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,490
if you look at the names there there
it's like most of the IT industry is in

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,030
in

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,240
is is present in in some form in
OpenStack

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,149
it's not only a alaska section of the IT
industry is also

32
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,060
like that the open-source funny portion
of the above the industry so you

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,259
and up if you walk on OpenStack you end
up being visible an honest

34
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,409
by by those companies it's not just open
source from the company's

35
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,920
it's also we also have a like all
Microsoft or VMware

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,429
night consuming stuff so it's not snot

37
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,709
like all all open source from the
company's but most of the year

38
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,720
organs of money companies will you'll
you'll find their

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,760
when the no they weren't safe exception
of tonight Amazon and Google

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,910
are not present in OpenStack because
they basically run closed source popular

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,180
software for their

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,629
public cloud offering so you get noticed
and then you can get a job quite easy

43
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,290
because

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,950
the the OpenStack job market is is quite
hot so you'd

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,950
this is a a drop from Indian dot com

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,708
I'm getting like the growth of jobs in
in recent times

47
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,540
and so you can see that Titan is pretty
hot

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,170
then cloud is very hot and then bag

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,790
OpenStack is extremely hot so rented you
we we stop on nothing so it's quite easy

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,609
to get

51
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,870
up but and then there is a shortage of
not aging up in stock never said

52
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,060
nobody will ask for someone with i three
years of often stacked

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,959
experience or otherwise the number of
people can actually answer that are like

54
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,440
handful of persons and so

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,739
if you build some kind of expertise in
OpenStack

56
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,959
it's actually quite easy to get a job
from our last time into had like a

57
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,099
room with maybe three thousand people in
there and all the companies were

58
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,359
we asked anti-u_s_ damn sure the hand if
they were hiring and like all the room

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,989
was having their hands up because
they're pretty having trouble

60
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,549
hiring enough people to welcome this so
it's

61
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,750
small thing because you actually can get
a job working on a free open-source

62
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,080
for software project and then profit
because the

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
since the job market is a bit constraint
on OpenStack

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,250
in there is actually x5 are you in in
getting an A you know this

65
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,470
same same company in the intercom doing
doing stats its US salaries

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,810
not French or you're considering that
you can see that software developers

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,060
Buyten that represents our neighbors are

68
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,650
like at the same level I'm almost the
same level

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,599
I whereas not been snagged ever the job
market next

70
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,310
the make an excellent job market makes
it like pay more

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,220
so you can profit and then you can eat a
right on

72
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,430
and that's an interesting thing that we
don't hear because

73
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,090
offense that is project that is coping
up a need ever opt among

74
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,039
a set of companies there is no like
parent companies of main sponsor our

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,960
or anything an so it's not companies
competing Co to OpenStack it's actually

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,989
dead rubbers individual never personal
training Co to insect same way as the

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,699
Linux kernel

78
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,530
are or iPad she I'm projects

79
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,138
so whatever influence you build when you
walk in OpenStack

80
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,620
is not your company its it's your

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,820
inference it's your on expertise that
should be held

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,699
it said you don't really know your
company John Collier will benefit will

83
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,660
benefit from that

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,780
obviously meant whatever inference
should deliver the project or expertise

85
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,979
in building or the project is under your
name

86
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,430
so it's quite easy to switch on players
and

87
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,660
to you can switch for the one that gives
you a better package or

88
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,780
or gives you the opportunity to work
from home or gives you the opportunity

89
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,969
to you

90
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,639
walk wonder percent of your time on the
upswing project

91
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,660
and it's not just like a minute it not
just like a palm eyes here you will be

92
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,539
able to switch umpires whenever you want

93
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,979
if you're look at this trip this is that
they can committee OpenStack

94
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,969
so the people that I elected to make
your final decisions

95
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,110
so every contributor votes and we get
some some others get elected to this

96
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,610
this morn and in on this picture more
than half the members of the committee

97
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,460
actually switched I'm pro years since
they started walking on a

98
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,049
Sep so liked 7 out of 13 people

99
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,240
here I can switch from priority so it's
not just like something I'd say don't be

100
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,770
a true

101
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,159
to try to sell you two up inside its
actually happening we built the job

102
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,130
market that is

103
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,690
the proper from the bus

104
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,319
and finery I you should continue to have
inside because you are traditions in the

105
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,180
world

106
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,780
you did cloud computing is defining how

107
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,250
IT resources will be consumed in the
next decade

108
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,440
and potentially after and there is a
monopoly

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,850
building up which is Amazon Web Services
and now the de facto

110
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,889
I standard to have the the market share
down the the elephant in the room

111
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,419
and if we don't react now we are
actually building the next Microsoft the

112
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,400
next Google

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,049
and with potentially for far-reaching

114
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,180
consequences that's

115
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,600
the main reason why I'm walking up a
sack is not to you hand

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,030
and as an easy victory there they're
very good so it's a help

117
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,630
fight and and we're trying to fight it

118
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,469
you also put a bit more vendors to open
source I was mentioning earlier

119
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,599
Microsoft Oracle

120
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,069
VMware they went off inside because they
were kinda forced to

121
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,419
and so if we can move more of those
twenty sure vendors

122
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,219
to to open source for any project that I
openly developed and not

123
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,440
not like a an open-source p.m.

124
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,789
main sponsor thing and then we

125
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,039
we we you accomplish something we
brought

126
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,960
free software an open-source to allow
for a group of companies

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,388
and finally we also promote a model that
is that is

128
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,590
good for I think that offers and free
software in general which is

129
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,250
apart actually exist outside of any
corporate

130
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,560
main corporate sponsor also that's what
we call open innovation

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,710
the idea multiple companies should
contribute to a saying the same project

132
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,250
on equal terms

133
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,650
without that the field of play being
being sent it to words one of them

134
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,909
that's a good model and continuing to
OpenStack

135
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,780
is also wat u Anchorage more companies
to switch to that mall which is better

136
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,289
so i hope i convinced you time now we
can go

137
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:08,289
go

138
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,460
so quick question is I which companies
actually hire people for one night

139
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,810
not 1 105 I sows in

140
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,800
the dollars per year

141
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,300
its its it's the companies that used you
you've seen on the first line

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,529
with with the numbers so that would be
the i dnt rats

143
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,429
the a Samsung I

144
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,279
like space chewing

145
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,289
so they're they're they're different
different positions obviously you you

146
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:43,899
can be

147
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,649
a bit customer-facing are you can be
fully on on the open source project

148
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,709
I you can be mean that there there at
the World Ranjha of stuff sometimes it's

149
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,510
it's implementing some time its def
deploying some time its its

150
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,760
I its generally connected to you the

151
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,649
went when they hired an outside an upper
it's likely to contribute to the

152
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,350
G open source project so I'll

153
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,279
and and and one last think about this I
haven't seen yet someone showing up at

154
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,140
one of all the proper summit

155
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,370
unemployment not getting back with a job
so we have

156
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,890
one in Paris in

157
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,779
November so I that served with place to
be if you're looking for a if you like

158
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,519
know how to write some code and want to
check get a job

159
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,540
so where II consecutive collection of
projects are

160
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,439
there are plenty of areas if you have
some expertise in some areas it's

161
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,260
interesting

162
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,939
to to know where it went to landscape
looks like

163
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,250
Allmendinger what is what we called
integrated what is that some stuff that

164
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,550
we will use every six months

165
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,750
as as a common as a common thing there

166
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,170
contributed projects which are like
project that want to become partisan

167
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,729
bickering twenties

168
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,149
and there are a number of other other
projects we have recouped those projects

169
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,519
in what we call programs which I like
basically teams

170
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
of Deborah Peters from by these
companies that get together with a

171
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,820
common goal

172
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,019
and walk on a given number of of
carpenters

173
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,040
so you have an identical ones like who

174
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,540
I am which double up one of the key
components of OpenStack don't also

175
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,310
always into one slight sheen way

176
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,630
or infrastructure where the goal is to
serve all

177
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,010
the rest of the project I with with

178
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,939
values thanks so let's look at them

179
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,250
more in detail I'm the main integrated
projects on over

180
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,519
which is night GM's as a service 30 and

181
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm you have an API you get at the end
back and you can

182
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,079
you can Dempster Swift is object storage

183
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,649
so that's a feinstein shrub storage in a
random fashion

184
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,220
a cinder is brooks no engine service to
you get back to a drug

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,450
drug devices nurturing is all about

186
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,339
network resources communicate what
segments balls

187
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,380
firewalls between that and you can dance
load balancers that

188
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,130
canister and then you have

189
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,959
12 which gives you database is a service
see you

190
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,390
like 10 partitioned databases that will
be back captain

191
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,490
and scaled and and you can like you have
an API that creepy to create table users

192
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,290
et cetera

193
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,870
Keystone is a centralized indication for

194
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,930
I don't think so if you like more more
for authentication authorization person

195
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,920
that's for me

196
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,130
good area for you I see no matter
provides metering and monitoring for the

197
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,560
wall

198
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,359
running thing so if you are more into
money trying stop for a professional

199
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,610
that's an interesting project to
contribute to on horizon is the web UI

200
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,730
so that's the user friendly

201
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,740
face of OpenStack for people I don't
really want to play with the rest API

202
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,690
directly you can

203
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,380
you can use to the web UI and if you're
going to JavaScript and

204
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,149
and bootstrap that's probably one good
place to go

205
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,649
and finally heat is orchestration of
resources

206
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,240
the ability to describe a sad up in
stock resources

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,579
in a single template and deploy that in
a in a predictable fashion

208
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,790
so if you're more into confusion ash
mint and

209
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,219
and orchestration thats good place to be

210
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,310
there are other project that just night
Mar

211
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,300
bubbling up the top now a seven eyes
data processing and service

212
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,029
actually uses Hadoop right now I am so
you can like bush

213
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,240
whose jobs and and retrieve results

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,529
Marconi's message choose a service you
pollution emissions cue then you push

215
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,790
messages and retrieve messages

216
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,099
designates is dns a: service

217
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,970
so about interact with name services
were where STPI

218
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,640
Bobby can is management of Secrets that
is like

219
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,819
delivery of of secret keys cryptographic
keys

220
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,130
I get source of randomness et cetera

221
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,680
and the difference between bob again is
and something like swift is that

222
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,079
you can actually have put its but its
are from who accessed what when

223
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,150
and and

224
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,870
which is quite interesting for a to
cryptographic keys

225
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,560
are ironic is about deploying
well-coached governmental

226
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,770
so when unplugged and provisioning he
and you could actually deployed the same

227
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,480
workloads

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,970
on to a wean machine uses

229
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,250
like pics dixie with to you with the
machine and then the price definite and

230
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,780
can't

231
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,970
is actually yes been up of the

232
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,580
scanner that was in Nova as an
independent project

233
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,030
because catering attorney something that
other projects can benefit from so it's

234
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,819
an effort to reduce code duplication
between between projects

235
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,960
and then we have plenty of other
programs documentation we need

236
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880
documentation

237
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,840
and because sometimes it's not pretty
clear how to you

238
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,520
use this infrastructure I is a major

239
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,460
program we have a it's all the
democratic process for we have you up

240
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,840
inside

241
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,380
I won't get into too much details on
that because I have another talk

242
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,150
tomorrow at

243
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,470
at 10 a.m. in that testing and
automation their room so if you're

244
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,170
interested in

245
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,689
how we act around development and it's
quite interesting

246
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,910
time you should shot there actuate
because we do

247
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,310
have tests and deployment is interesting
one

248
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,050
this is actually quite difficult to the
price so how can we simplified

249
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,329
deployment of intact and that's when the
triple project as

250
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,440
daily is to run OpenStack to deploy
OpenStack said OpenStack

251
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,610
on OpenStack and so you can actually

252
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,680
problematically a deeply sorry and
continues

253
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,920
me deliver OpenStack as as you go

254
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,110
and its slide the a new things it's not
completely or partially at but it's like

255
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,320
one of the most interesting and
development that we had in the last your

256
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,330
common libraries another program

257
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,690
it's the idea that we have like plenty
of

258
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,450
code that is reused across project we
should actually make libraries so

259
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,040
so that we don't duplicate code or so
it's a good clean up

260
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,880
can keen clean-up exercise for his
management is my program

261
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,040
what is measure for OpenStack so its
trying to track what gets done

262
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,750
and and put you somebody's every six
months in a predictable fashion

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,910
it's also about security advisories and

264
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,270
stable frenchman's and finding that
stack is our last program

265
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,800
that's stacked is are all in one east or
that we heavily used in integration test

266
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,620
to check that

267
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,410
if we install everything it steel
walking

268
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,800
altogether so it's both wat u in store
open stack for development also

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,469
heavily used in testing so that gives
you tonight the picture of

270
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,780
are the landscape of projects we have
enough in stock but that doesn't give

271
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,980
you an idea of

272
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,280
what type of contributions actually
wanted in

273
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,510
in OpenStack am i doing

274
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,720
not too bad so we have the robbers
obviously we need a robber's

275
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,880
and pork or changes that can be features
that can be back fixes

276
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,470
the code is mostly Buyten there is a
hint of Dallas create especially in the

277
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,320
web UI

278
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,410
obviously we still can use done by the
robbers don't despair

279
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,290
the especially we have pieces up the
infrastructure that

280
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,360
a like when guarantor Jenkins and we
sometimes need

281
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,030
stuff being bush in that direction but
it's mostly by

282
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,540
at that point you may wonder

283
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,750
yeah that that sounds like complex stuff
tonight I can't do that

284
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,900
and

285
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,900
the answer is yes because a Biden is

286
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,040
easy and this is actually not rocket
science

287
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,260
at mean we are not writing and you
hypervisor

288
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,290
or on writing in you log device for for
our

289
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,520
broke device type for for the count for
anything we're just

290
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,839
interfacing with just the group between
between a a

291
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,230
REST API and we always sources that
smart people

292
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,540
actually run and so the trick is to do
it

293
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,609
at scale that the real trick is is that
we do it at a scale that is so massive

294
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,839
that we discover new problems but it
doesn't mean I on

295
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,040
a pre-existing knowledge that only a
handful of people that

296
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,200
Saudi walking on cloud 10 years ago with
would have

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,590
its it's not rocket science its

298
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,459
action if you if you Don a specially
system management type programming where

299
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,780
where you were committed

300
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,270
things and and you just night

301
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,710
created glue between applications it's
actually quite went mere

302
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,230
weren't we are actually doing there are
a few specialized

303
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,870
areas like networking where we where you
can't we think you don't know anything

304
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,199
about networking its way

305
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,770
difficult but on the others interacting
with an enterprise simple we had

306
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,360
like Daniel presentations as before it's
just about

307
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,000
maintaining the crew between the API
services

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,270
the this cater that lets you get which
machine you should actually get

309
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,550
stuff when on and and and any dropped
calls

310
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,210
but then we also need absences admins

311
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,780
we we run are all infrastructure using
puppets

312
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,649
so if you like to write by Patrice IP's
its

313
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,540
actually quite it's contributed out one
factor is also completely open source

314
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:29,970
and

315
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,510
and push to get with his interest so
it's completely up and you can look and

316
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,020
see

317
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,610
and if you're interested I'm punisher
gym will be

318
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,300
happy to discuss with I we need
continues deployment expertise for the

319
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,360
people a team because they're addressing
this

320
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,199
difficult are question of how can we
continue to deploy OpenStack

321
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,040
with and and do that in in an open
source project that you can reuse

322
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,490
if you want to buy OpenStack you can
also just be

323
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,760
I user hand support users that are
asking questions on our ask

324
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,629
that I've been stagnant organ website
its it's one way of contributing

325
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,760
to OpenStack as well we also need you X

326
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,150
UX designers if's what you do for a
living is doing wireframes

327
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,120
we our actually trying to think about a

328
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
does did you I'm the of values
interfaces that we deliver now

329
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,310
and so there is a place for you with you
into wireframing and thinking

330
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,889
before doing and that would be UX
designers

331
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,020
grip we also need technical writers up

332
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,440
and we do what Google Books Prince

333
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,560
which is right write a book in an open
source way you know

334
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,700
as as a group so they have those

335
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,110
on did gather all together and and have
biz

336
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,320
button when the QuickBooks Prince where
where they share the

337
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,429
the days spread the chapters up the
broke they're trying to ride between

338
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,190
them and

339
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,870
in one week the minute should write a
book that already is winning two

340
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,250
published its for me not to bad and this
is the OpenStack operations guide

341
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,210
that we have also have another sack
security i that was written this way

342
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,780
so we push open-source Office of trust
and development into areas where we're

343
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,530
things we're not actually done that way
which is like book editing

344
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,720
or are you I wireframing we could also
use twenty senators

345
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,450
let you can see here English is better
supported than anything else

346
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,020
and add

347
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,370
that point you might be also asking well

348
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,840
the thats all fine and dandy but it's a
bit confusing where our

349
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,530
where can I make a difference where
where if I show up and do stuff

350
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,990
I will be seen as a good citizen or
known as a

351
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,020
someone that just wanna wants to have a
job and my response to that

352
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,660
is mission continue its strategy
conclusion other than tactical

353
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,650
contributions

354
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,450
and practical conditions would be this
so-called our futures

355
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,330
stuff that you just only you care about
going on prayer cares about

356
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,820
drivers and support for specific
technology so you are like up

357
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,379
vendor for sanity and you just want
OpenStack to be able to run on top of

358
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,180
your hardware

359
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,520
that's not really helpful for most of us

360
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,879
I think we think options adding
confusion just for the sake of it

361
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,490
not so great and fixing your own bag so
banks that on the effect yourself

362
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,290
whereas strategical tuitions

363
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,730
so fix critical bug fixes we have
sometimes critical bug fixes

364
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,270
especially me some them blocking are
continuous integration

365
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,680
a automation and then we actually need

366
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,970
some people to you be willing to tackle
those how the issues and fix them

367
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,700
and and that's a when I would cause
strategy contribution

368
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,880
walking on common code libraries to
reducing technical that

369
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,690
is also being useful contributing
integration tests

370
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,490
that's been useful because if we
consider novice if it's not tested it's

371
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,130
broken

372
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,350
so I'm when there is no integration test
it's actually broken

373
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,320
and the documentation is always useful
and strategy

374
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,649
security but its and patches are also
things that are generally useful for the

375
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,110
pop

376
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,870
I maybe we'll posed the question to
until the end make sure that

377
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,739
we have I'm

378
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,110
we have time for them okay so when

379
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,590
last parts up his position is how how
would you continue to OpenStack

380
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,949
and I yet we're not using progressed

381
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,670
the OpenStack way we have prefer
reference master key prison repositories

382
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,260
and well have commuters we have only
have could be viewers

383
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,250
so I owe you put a change it gets review
their number of people and at some point

384
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,690
it gets approved by

385
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,890
and week or number of people and then it
gets phone

386
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,810
out throughout this thing automation
system that I will present tomorrow

387
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,679
and then its it gets merged so you don't
have a nice

388
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,290
someone with superpower that is superior
to anyone else that

389
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,370
actually has the ability to commit
current your repository

390
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,570
everyone goes who this could use a stand
there is no our

391
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,590
while account that lets you use it and

392
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,810
if it's not tested candid and if it's
not working kinda

393
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,620
and that into Indo contradictory so

394
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,760
there is no way to break things that we
actually test

395
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,860
which is the reason why if it's not
tested is broken because

396
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,070
so that's how we do things and so this
is how we commit

397
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,570
we change so you had grown to be present
because its repeal the change in your

398
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,149
branch

399
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,540
submitted for review at that point to
change gets automatically

400
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,240
tested so you have a first in back but
omitted from our

401
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,640
automated testing systems then the
change gets reviewed by humans

402
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,280
and some most humans have approval
writes that

403
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,639
I will if you have enough for them then
you can visit him

404
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,410
get approved then the change gets
protested with the current state of

405
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,530
after code repository just in case
something breaking

406
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,649
you know what and then the changes merch

407
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,090
this is how we do things

408
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,189
before you continue down number of steps
on most key so that you have the right

409
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,929
accounts for the quality system so you
need to create

410
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,690
a launch pad account because that's what
we use for authentication we're

411
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,960
tried removing out a bit but at that

412
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,910
moment today this is still the the
process should be following

413
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,870
you need to join the OpenStack from
nation because to continue to advance

414
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,689
thank you need to be a member of

415
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,929
the of nonprofit as group that plans to

416
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:48,600
the will infrastructure and and

417
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,020
and Trademark things are on OpenStack
then you can log on into

418
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,309
reviewed our offense I got or using the
login you created with launch pad

419
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,190
and you can agree to our contributor

420
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,260
License Agreement it's not a cop right
assignment it's just

421
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,400
a license II agreement so

422
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,600
this is actually acceptable even if we
try to get wet

423
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,699
and although steps are a

424
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,620
described that we keep age that I put at
the minimum this page

425
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,649
and then it looks like this

426
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,340
we use a get plugin

427
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,620
call get with you that we did developed
within up in stacked so that you can

428
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,959
have a1 when command to submit a change
for reviewing our new system

429
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,559
try to expect this you git clone the
repository I

430
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,030
you and bands use get with you man s

431
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,610
asked to set up the remote that will
point to Garrett's

432
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,549
could reduce system that we have then
you make some changes you commited than

433
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,740
and then you do get review and that
pushes

434
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,780
that change your proposed to a

435
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,200
our country this is Stan and you can

436
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,909
you have a URL that you can reference
and then I guess I humans will be he

437
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,809
will get automatically tested for you
menswear preview it itself

438
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,668
answer everything that is published
weapon cycle goes

439
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,669
into this final and everything is
visible because all the good reviews

440
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:16,750
happen in a

441
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,840
a public website so thats something it's
really easy to produce better

442
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,529
and this is what

443
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:30,289
our guarantee could review system looks
like so you have the change here with

444
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,250
the commit message

445
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,600
halfway ever proposed it the here is
that

446
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,668
approval thing so actually reviewed it

447
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,899
but I don't have the power to approve it

448
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,529
anyway half-life you here approved it
but is

449
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,000
not we need at least two of those
calling you where's to approve it before

450
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,330
it's

451
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,230
accepted but anyone can participate in a
code review your have to

452
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,159
be special anyway and their

453
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,919
he is that change you can and he rise to

454
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,710
all the comments that we push to that
could really use a stand for that change

455
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,010
and the neat thing about guarantee that
you can come into

456
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,870
at line level so you can have these
small discussions about this is better

457
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,539
or not

458

contribute everything this way

461
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,340
everything is code

462
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,139
so are the basic thing is know how to
interact with get

463
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,269

464
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,700

469
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,560
Jeep

470
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,210
a just 10 short questions I didn't see
clowns and the

471
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,400
in the list of programs has sucked up in
OpenStack program glands

472
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,920
the image so service glance

473
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,960
no IPO I missed it okay so

474
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,380

one can you

475
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,730
briefly explain the see a CLA the

476
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,820
agreement I N MAIN not

477
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,840
Noor engine you can take

478
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,449
today now you know more about it

479
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,640
nap

480
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,750
so it's our it's sad license grants

481
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,760
I think

482
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,640
that is according to some early years

483
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,650
necessary with him want to be too

484
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,290
and I can I since project for food
production but

485
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,180
they dole all agree on and which is the
reason why we're trying to get panicked

486
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,640
because

487
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,710
it's a barrier to entry and its
apparently use less

488
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,480
according to how thorough know you're so
we should try to get with it because

489
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,950
that creates especially for companies
ballast

490
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,210
20 because they actually have to read it
and to understand it

491
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,500
this American cheese it's a license
grant night night you will not see you

492
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,500
