22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,990
the moon is full are will investor
doesn't reach the other way

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,039

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,970
like the pool good

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,990
okay

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm the motivation for the discussion
was

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,960
I was working on a total conversion

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,990
of another game into the best but engine
and

29
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,079
after converting some of their buildings

30
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,779
I stumbled upon one called nuclear power
plant

31
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,799
the Chalfont very exciting because the
%ah

32
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,829
that's not a building I would like to
have fun my battlefield

33
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,429
if every episode shot did I wouldn't
like to be on the battlefield

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,270
I'll okay when I looked into the
high-end

35
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,400
to him convert it its content nothing

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,489
a expect yeah sis

37
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,030
building is producing some energy at its
compass consuming some

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,030
material it's not for producing any
waste

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,610
in our army is Sarah Anne

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,000
for review for you full seriously

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,980
services rather okay it's not

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,040
producing any waste and destroys a
building

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,060
causes no for us our action

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,190
in the game set kind of made

45
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,450
me sing if we s game developers

46
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,899
short introduce k Michelle Knicks

47
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,629
which are so far away from real-life

48
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,760
sets a mite hurt people's

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,849
expectations and put influence politics

50
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,859
I don't know

51
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,000
the I guess you are many debt game
developers here

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
and to most games feature of warlike
editions

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,420
so true no

54
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,420
but what are your games but me

55
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,540
card you and

56
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,239
a few ethical restrictions on loose in
your project

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,900
but it's an interesting question because
for example

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,010
long time ago there was a game

59
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,820
flash go both

60
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,549
why and a thought about the question

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,830
about myself because be both love
criticize

62
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,860
the don't know and all the industry fast

63
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,020
so the game in the was

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,329
review must play train tomb

65
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,600
the distorted you long all the marketing

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,030
all the department the GM in Exeter and
of course you can

67
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,169
with objectives on the on the the gun

68
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,630
really nasty things he additives that
make

69
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,230
adicto begin with me you needed

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,760
sorry law and the what happens be the
beginning on track to

71
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,480
being it was impossible you use it

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,560
immediate so the next time said p.m.

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,570
be really about us so

74
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,630
I miss I the cheating people firing
employees

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,710
doing read about and what happened

76
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,919
is my Google 0 thirties was like

77
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,729
really with up in is so I said well

78
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,729
run right now billionaire so I'm going
to try to

79
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,969
do the right the right things so I'm
going to try to hire people

80
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,590
the movie YouTube with a what happened

81
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,219
by he's Michael was traffic good getting
down back

82
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,710
game so I discovered that the game was
the law just with the size

83
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,810
the dollars but it was like kind of sad
because

84
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,360
was the message that the game will send
them to you

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,380
the only way to do good for you earning
money

86
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,950
well impacting world and I i was really

87
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,180
the isn't going to the ball you know
about the the message

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,380
ever be message who drive message

89
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,240
he when you play you see something

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,330
any you receive a satanic message bestow

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,479
mmm yep this I'm

92
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,740
this discussion isn't anything new to
games better fitness

93
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,919
same with the anti-media yeah what kinda
messages

94
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,340
do you want to convey also on bus space
week two games though is that

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,560
they are simulations about sees that

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,080
systems in the nation's basically every
game seem that some kind of a system

97
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,780
and I think that main medical question
is whether whether it's okay though

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,159
breeze and the stimulation without
telling that this does not represent

99
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,219
reality

100
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,710
possibly even even disguising it as it
as if it would represent reality

101
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,640
for example things is a good example it
kind of price Co

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,940
okay has admitted they'd like to do it
but it going to frys it was 100

103
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,370
The Sims from ya muslims so

104
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,460
it kinda prize pool cement reality I

105
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,719
and it gonna go on dates this that this
is is like the

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,820
real life though it is a playful yes

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,020
but anyway the messages that it conveys
these

108
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,400
that you'll get when you get money you

109
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,370
get my things and so on so you get to
develop your character by getting money

110
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,140
and navigating the social networks and
so on

111
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,650
Mar the point is that it never

112
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,260
never says explicitly that this is our
version

113
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,880
all reality and this might not actually
be

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,400
reality is it understandable that people

115
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,539
understand this without explicitly
telling them from

116
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,210
get I but I sought aren't most people

117
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,299
knowing all cases the game but

118
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,710
is a true for children I witnessed a boy
and a girl playing

119
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,760
at P pat's what is it called

120
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,820
a playground and

121
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,159
support charm two points ago violent her
too little and

122
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,890
when she was interviewed about that he
told

123
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,990
I yeah I was expecting her to turn

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,430
into banana are some a social I

125
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,580
it took me some time to realize that
this concept is from

126
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,289
supermodel your rich

127
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,690
silencer a lot yes Obama US

128
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,950
innocent vendor watch it as and adult

129
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,950
but it's free for children even for

130
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,440
very small children and be may be
appealing to them

131
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,450
and yeah it costs at incident

132
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,870
its playground anything

133
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,880
anything causes an easy at the
playground okay yeah i i think that

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,159
and be this we problem about

135
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,929
key but flower foreign about it like it
it to do the people who are

136
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,079
watching with chiller so again a

137
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,320
we would be getting you I billion so you
know

138
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,390
it lightly target and we want to meet
the people

139
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,399
and a yeah Sunday messiness and I

140
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,399
my yet by harm game and at the same time

141
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,620
a you know that if more children the

142
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,620
this game payments at you can expect
Division II

143
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,620
then that we do ba'ath work but

144
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,899
I think the this problem should be on

145
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,510
I'm are little teacher in not really on
the games that people

146
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,980
the gate and each chillin it thank you

147
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,500
they can teach chillin thing and at the
same time a

148
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,550
can be leave children and attended did
and expect them to learn how life works

149
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,959
the like the ending I'm like so do you
really think that

150
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,260
before incredible Bulls game was table
saws were

151
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,520
you really think about the timing on
Ian's

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,920
LaCie just want to create a gay of me
which was fun for yourself

153
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,439
let it briefly bit about myself I i'm a
game

154
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,940
for myself I hate that being on a but at
the same time

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,480
being orders that doesn't mean that you
can do that in with you because you know

156
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,200
will you gain you %um they topics yet
yeah

157
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,680
they the style your game and unity so
this does that matter

158
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,260
because it yeah he's a anybody can it
had to be

159
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,459
and can play again modified at st. Louis
you you have unit

160
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,540
endl about the people were going to

161
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,750
Lee you be at least you should have BB

162
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,080
that matter

163
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,640
the question is just how you can make
sure that on Bella's agree on a

164
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,689
similar Todd Williams and

165
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,660
level of content so say I i seeeee

166
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,469
you could have guidelines about 19 year
old brother Danny

167
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,600
samantha is likely that I can forgive
Olympic I me to the

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
you can do whatever you want like

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,270
yell in invest not we have no core

170
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,819
so there's no plot it's a war game but
without plot

171
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,700
and desist maybe the good idea

172
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,020
on the one side I but

173
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,310
presenting report to clean

174
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,420
might be a better idea on z/os aside by
my grandfather was in vote for two in

175
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,170
Russia

176
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,410
and yeah wasn't so nice

177
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,130
you have firm commercially games
advertising military

178
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm art connote Obama

179
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,810
thank you very much police big this week

180
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,839
it looked a little bit slime look a
little bit more official

181
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,110
sleep see some condoms

182
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,230
doubt we have certain very realistic

183
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,660
america's army first-person shooter

184
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,750
which is indeed very realistic

185
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,380
I've been told so but it does not
present any plot

186
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,459
and term people trust vanish from this
battlefield and

187
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,880
yeah but this is so in for me my opinion
sis is crossing

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,200
a lot I would like to have first person
shooter us

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,100
s much realistic as possible even worse

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,209
pardon well very orchid yet maybe

191
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,640
members a lot of trumping also so

192
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,050
you really see is this is not the real
war but if you want

193
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,599
to assimilate sorry war simile simulate
all of it

194
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,130
please history you disagree

195
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,820
hi yep

196
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,930

197
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,020
yeah moment day buoyed by running game
is over

198
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,150
both but

199
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,740
the I really need you you feel you to
get to the nation that

200
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,910
learning of the line between game

201
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,130
so I think look here the realistic

202
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,630
morning I know good back using blood

203
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,140
hopefully yeah I said happy have two
separate

204
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:54,140
in your because there'd be no stopping
down the river

205
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,720
sorry pip pip peace talk louder hugs

whose guy

208
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,850
yeah whose this

209
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,110
was

210
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,430
up

211
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,459
prime

212
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,430
be

213
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,430
his me

214
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,689
mmm thought so your part to some

215
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:54,269
complete realism is just not possible a
boring

216
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,399
not via

217
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,589
from

218
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,930
that's the point

219
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,390
use three points in here that we can
discuss

220
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,569
was the whole one point use views

221
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,120
is in our in

222
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,910
any are can be wasn't the evening to you
to 10

223
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,569
so when you see a movie miss the mark
good movie but movie complete reality or

224
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,830
not maybe

225
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,230
see you no people movies of

226
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,360
on that are really funny blonde

227
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,270
nor laws or the eighty men okay that's
fine for

228
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,439
you do no blog but he's not in reality
and you

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,960
realize what they're doing just we great

230
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,910
cement factories when you play a video
game something

231
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,569
kinda party going well and for him

232
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,010
and a few consumers you 10

233
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,370
to feed real-life for example I

234
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,480
into school myself playing Assassin's
Creed im

235
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,530
lot in of course I I like to travel so

236
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,130
when they were good what your money
magazine oh my god I just

237
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,830
Klaipeda you feel like I yeah

238
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,090
good glad it did not go not but but but
you feel like to impose

239
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,760
and you get scared about yourself
because you

240
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,790
your brain auspey in such a way a little
bit the bar you

241
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,920
been ready mission and there is the

242
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,160
lose another factor the the challenge
the challenges

243
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,709
when you play a video game you challenge

244
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,010
any in it's a gay some people fun if you
try to make it realistic

245
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,319
he say see Diane you don't play anymore

246
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,400
gates finds a lesson okay but his

247
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,030
not a game anymore it see something
different means a lot more of

248
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,290
assimilation 30

249
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,770
exactly so and games up getting boring
more immersive

250
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,069
so finally just fish you hope that those
who builds up

251
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,710
are I don't remember the name right now
but I really think the

252
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,910
the sensation and the beans are going to
be mercy

253
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,640
and I think it's going to be a little
bit dangerous for some

254
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,520
not all the people not the mass media
you know but probably

255
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,040
some week people up doesn't make that
difference

256
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,349
so peering between reality and fiction
and

257
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,370
and and you maybe a.m.

258
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,040
I like to at you talked about movies

259
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,380
and commercially games bantam every
movie or commercially game

260
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,420
is rated by some organization in most
countries

261
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,860
there's a vote but that's not true for
open source games

262
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,810
I have not seen open source game greater
yeah

263
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,079
I'm either I just happening to check the
games are not

264
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,850
about fun only fun is one thing that
came to me about

265
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,280
Duchess p.m. can be about fun but neck
and the other

266
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,800
more also that is not your fun enjoyment

267
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,159
and the other crimes been joined us for
help highlight this fact

268
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,870
like like I'll a

269
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,208
well there have been expanded score into
games are mostly concentrated on fun

270
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:11,900
part

271
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,780
for them they have been explained it
would be a restaurant and these kinda

272
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,430
or already signed up I I

273
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,459
scary games that are are not

274
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,010
hit a media darkness can for example

275
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,080
which is not very fun in itself mark the
spot yeah I know I know if I'm

276
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,760
anyway the K cell well got movies on one
as well

277
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,400
but it's not funny in the same its banks
history

278
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,830
yeah but there's a message in back

279
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,080
there's a little message or

280
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,540
no problem his commercial

281
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,510
became commercial moons virtual surface

282
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,110
you should feel

283
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,479

323
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,200
that growth and I think this

324
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,430
good him through

325
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,570
but 3 the that

326
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,899
simple Portland muscle

327
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,840
that's a good point like

328
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,379
was uploaded

329
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,130

weekend world

334
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,779
and so I think it's a

335
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,029
the rule go third

336
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:10,369
visual their

337
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,850
places do though

338
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,600
real

339
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,530

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,809
home

344
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,440
marketing

345
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,660
his the for

346
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,539
inside

347
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,010

them

349
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,660
well with these

350
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,140
integrated like Mon

351
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,620

for you your lines a that s not to be
crossed this

357
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,209
commercial stopping spending real-life
money

358
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,800
yeah I think realize and all a

359
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,330
it offline and line world

360
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,929
and do it think from

361
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,340
okay in one Google

362
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,220
yeah case yeah I won't let something and
ones at that

363
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,830
United punches somebody faith the

364
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,070
field the difference but also a

365
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,389
like it when when we were young for that
word

366
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,220
repeatedly games over it whatever that
would be lovely

367
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,530
dole's or other up and a even

368
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,710
like the admissibility growth in in yet
another

369
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,050
whatever I did and yeah I i would say
that

370
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,310
I don't know the difference between
it'll and a huge

371
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,520
so the the X the in libel

372
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,530
in playing a offline

373
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,350
Lee relied and the gave and I don't
think that we we need to go

374
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,530
it too much into really Nancy Yankees

375
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,740
should be the like realistic because e2

376
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,810
it peach people that doing that being

377
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:46,110
begin by cooker

378
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,600
the sorry she should

379
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,510
sup

380
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,740
ethical to overhauls doing plots

381
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,350
I

382
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,320
yeah 6 yet ago

383
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,750
you perfect yeah about

384
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,970
both I

385
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,710
about I

386
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,830
but yeah

387
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,360
but back to the few necktie you the

388
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,570
walk if money getting being exactly in
the

389
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,399
thing that causes at the gym %uh drug
companies get up off my hubby

390
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,678
your actually get money wrong the
adhesion himself not not mildly drunk

391
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,230
mayor but from the player don't get it.
they have to pay more because they want

392
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,700
more

393
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,830
and then you'll give them more gym this
is

394
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,980
this very it is unquestionably fight if
i'm concerned. about it but of course

395
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,070
there is a huge crater lake culture that

396
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,389
actually haven't seen that his real new

397
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,000
pain one how to build I

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,409
mom at I connect not or all of this no
doubt say

399
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:09,159
all yeah yes indeed I think about life
being gay

400
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,690
they have today in game yeah but the
thing is that you can do it

401
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,700
you but the the has a degree is not
being it

402
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,850
in itself that your connected directly
to the at each other elements then it's

403
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,168
a tough loss goals was very bad but if
you're

404
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,049
if you steal a low well meaningful parts
that don't leave the

405
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,399
costing money then and then you provide
an alternative or

406
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:34,120
for people that but that won't go but
our ticket to the game up to

407
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,459
love to spend the money another I anyway

408
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,360
the other aspect about connecting money
I

409
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,010
i think is a I for example

410
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,419
if you if you I'm

411
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,550

anything independent of course you're
right

442
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,660
there must be a freedom of Oct but I
think it should be signed somehow yeah

443
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,190
you all introduce stuff certain

444
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,350
might affect younger people so

445
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,750
put a sign in front of it

446
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,049
at me usually don't do that let's not
test no

447
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,690

you know your glass its its kinda

536
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,080
stop calling it that the many stuff
resent it could be at all anyway

537
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,460
history um it about the model of

538
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,550
the the evil act being inside the
Parthenon up

539
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,560
not the game I mean we will hard her
media crazy

540
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,419
crazy well I'm don't going to rest let
the

541
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,720
yes even though I want to you some cars
works for

542
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,790
those articles that blame game on on the

543
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,009
donde and Marth that people are doing
which is of course

544
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,250
used a and has no basis in the Kennedy

545
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,550
as studies have shown that games are not
causing any want to do with this

546
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,040
however I think that in mind and

547
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,600
seems we are all a game developing
community and nobody's watching

548
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,560
from the internet there yeah I

549
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,610
that it having said that

550
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,130
it it's not it's a bit simplistic to
think that something is the inside

551
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,710
first that he's just retarded the
human-like the complex thing and games

552
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,230
are one thing that affects aid even even
if he beats

553
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,540
really really really bad to say it
because people love about the other day

554
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:56,840
that

555
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,530
with with this crazy crazy media
articles that have no

556
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,600
bases in reality even no games may feel

557
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,830
affect as Dustin

558
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,259

559
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,780

560
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,340
is something and

561
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,860
unrealized and you choose but

562
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,570
want that that's because sometimes like
with

563
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,990

564
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,339

675
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,020
sheep particularly over dreams

676
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,950
yeah I his somebody tried to

677
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,169
that I a something

678
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,250
yes dreams close to levels games

679
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,730

00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,859
with you so we're sometimes you

00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,459
just level way I'm fever

686
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,080
by fever dreams of the year dreams are
real awkward

687
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,180
moving her gruesome

688
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,759
having bedroom grazing for

689
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,700
you the point dreams are away

690
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,460
our way of up a seem like reality and
different outcomes is also there

691
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,020
are you sure I'm not sure but that's
what I don't think that name

692
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,100
they are thinking about that like be
they could be

693
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,440
from

694
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,960
I albeit a concept that haha I wasn't
having trouble for letting can I

695
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,990
yeah I remember that this is

696
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,529
people question altogether it's a about
money and games

697
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,730
because a game developer I people

698
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,240
people like like developing games
because they like games

699
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,040
so when you introduce money fun aspect
of the game but

700
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,680
question is a whether whether you'll
actually

701
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,270
are great things that gay in detail
because games

702
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,990
happening this well okay sort of I mean
this

703
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,930
so called Magic Circle which which which
is defined as:

704
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,790
Fiesta happen in the game I game while
the shelf

705
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,070
and things up from outside don't came up
big for me as I don't

706
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,070
affect outside well it of course
probably like that against the

707
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:13,070
expertise but this pues missus

708
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,880
up

709
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,020
midget wrestlers fight and i cant

710
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,950
I can way for inmates are then I can
build it right now if I have

711
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,279
money more than I i up other persons
castle

712
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,390
with 20 percent more efficient by

713
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,020
a I'll so then you are actually you are
actually

714
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,200
a breaking the game

715
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,359
because why we love games is probably
because they

716
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,850
they offer this different kinda a world
where

717
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:02,650
in things incorrectly in different ways
so you are injecting money into that

718
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,240
so my question is do we have a ethical
responsibility as game but it up

719
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,348
developers to actually keep games as
games

720
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:16,170
point blue you

721
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,829

regarding chip India group

873
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,740
I'm

874
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,729
been happier to know finished I

875
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,920
shimon speaking to look at the big
questions

876
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,230
it's something not just that I should
talk about okay we say markets

877
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,050
up being a very important question is
the reusable content

878
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,970
I'll in West always used free of me

879
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:22,649
that people just up no comparable your
own server which today

880
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,090
more roads from some sites on the
internet

881
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:31,640
but they don't have arrived loser so I
think that's a very important question

882
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,830
%uh how should this be handled I should
be handled

883
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,869
well he's getting content from would be
there not believe

884
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:41,200
my first again but since as the
stepbrother is

885
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,439
went through the gate correct you get
there content from

886
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,450
and how can they make sure there is all
legal

887
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:53,350
and alright sounds whatever's respective
yeah I'm

888
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,529

889
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:01,130
