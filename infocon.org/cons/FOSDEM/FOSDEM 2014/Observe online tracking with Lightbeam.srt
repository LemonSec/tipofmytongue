I K Erica on this presentation will be

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,990
project because I care about privacy on
the Internet and the first thing that I

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,570
wanted to

30
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,779
go to you today and that the Internet is
powerful know where this powerful

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,560
I'm Way out doing things today with the
web that

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,740
nobody imagined when the WebQuest

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,710
been at the first bank so we have
building at and %uh parroting system

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,839
from by fun

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,460
we are doing a lot of stuff I I recently
so

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,919
a fridge with me down it um so the

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,350
the web is not only about Abruzzo on the
computer is on

38
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,810
many devices everywhere and fortnightly

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,260
I'll only a few personae about to
understand how is a web is working

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,700
and one of the bad side the downside up

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,839
this is dat many people

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,270
just don't care about their data and wet

43
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,620
the web can be wrong with him with them
so

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,000
yet just a number

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,870
three and red millions of pictures

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm ages applaud 8 on Facebook every day

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,840
so must have them

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,459
are from very personal

49
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,790
or maybe provisional data bet thats

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,910
an amazing amount of up data which

51
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,970
are transferring using the web every day
and a fortnightly

52
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,340
the people who deal with that does that
a

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,030
um are doing that to have more money

54
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,350
the the goal of the corporation is

55
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,540
tune to yeah have money every day to

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,660
I'm and I think you you know that if
you're in

57
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,930
in the for them today that the
difference between nonprofit

58
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,290
and cooperation so my point today is

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,970
in the web it's pretty different because

60
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,040
you say okay I'm dealing with company
almost every day

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,130
like I'm going to make bank yeah I'm
going to the bakery bed

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,769
those companies are death right next to
you

63
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,130
if you have a problem with go with
Facebook with a big company on the web

64
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,780
you will not be able to is the contact
them USC

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,950
just after I will give an example over

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,238
a sorry which is really sad about
someone

67
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,959
who tried to contact who so

68
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,660
they are far from you you cannot do
anything Jenna

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,440
go there and talk with them a.m. and a

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,469
must have them already be like if

71
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,150
today you say okay what Facebook is
doing that I is wrong I don't want to

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,049
use Facebook anymore

73
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,950
a will you something s it will be ready
already have for you to use to find an

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,610
agreement

75
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,250
in the status if there is no agreement
Facebook there is no agreement to go

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,820
it's something too big to to be to
compete with

77
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,730
so this kind of company earning over
data is a problem

78
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,770
and the state's running or data is a
program to

79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,260
I think each around you you probably
know these

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,170
slide and they come from other priests
last three

81
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,670
in the NSA that's not an revealed to
everyone and I've John

82
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,230
I'll wanted the reason I'm doing this
bitch

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,139
once again because I already did it left
for them but I think it's important

84
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,910
because

85
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,280
this Jan so a maiden name she generously
bed

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,359
thats all the or the corporation

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,400
the NSA Adam agreement with them to
directly

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,989
and take data inside days this

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,550
that obeys so if you're using a software
services a

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,040
one of those companies are you get
Microsoft Yahoo Google Facebook

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,120
home use you sky

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,350
ivo everybody so yo por

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,169
you're probably have your data somewhere
I mean I try to have nine up i cant

94
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,580
and all this company I rate up to do

95
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,680
so here is a situation though the buying

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,470
okay then they say know that I'm sharing
didn't feature on the internet who cares

97
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,050
well there is many problems about that

98
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,140
the first one is the dependency you have
to the services

99
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,250
for example this area was talking about
was

100
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,410
from 8

101
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,970
an artist who was walking using almost
every Google services

102
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,070
very good and demanded to talk with all
the the contact you have

103
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,620
yes be used he just had to share

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,200
on his Welsh he used an Android phone

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,300
and when they like every morning it just

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,380
switch on his computer and so okay you
not allowed to access them anymore

107
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,880
because

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,270
your Aiken buscas you you

109
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,049
you do not respect anymore the the
town's abuse

110
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,030
so I was like okay no explanation though
thing

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,190
so say okay so I cannot write you an
email because you just goes may matter

112
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,530
a I would try to call you fate

113
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,020
it is fun and they were doing was
mocking a gay agenda that uses fun

114
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,950
anymore because you do not respect the
demo

115
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,680
use so no fun the email the

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,010
and eat its right to do a lot of
research I'll

117
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,120
during one which to know what

118
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
white is I conquest goes I am

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,320
and it it's been one which before 6882

120
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,480
so to Yuma someone from whoever to say

121
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,660
0 it because whenever oh but did a bag
on one of your pictures

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,130
went up there what you're doing there is
a naked she is so it was

123
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,820
considering as pedophilia but you know
this game have

124
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,830
up to you can find many church

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,219
well know saying nothing problematic so

127
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,640

which no fun knowing that no Welsh

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,010
nothing am I think you can imagine that
it's very problematic to be

129
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,620
as different as a service like that um

130
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,260
do's appointees I get hit and miss adept
as an now

131
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,750
you can say the SEM I don't care

132
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,040
if someone know that i'm looking for.
come around the internet

133
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,110
the point is today with

134
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,250
that different and tools the

135
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,780
other days I used their ever to know
which side you

136
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,549
you are visiting so they can say to you
okay you where to Amazon

137
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,290
you didn't pan the camera so you go to
e-bay and

138
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,360
this kind of information israeli

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,349
radio read you re raining but on for
every person who

140
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,839
who do some cells online if you ever had
to say

141
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,469
imagine in real life in this 38 you go
on the shop

142
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,750
and you don't find the shoes you were
looking for you go back and you go to

143
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,620
another show up

144
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,180
and if the seller in that show up Jan no

145
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,469
that you didn't find something in

146
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,870
a culture and have him I a chance tell
you exactly what you want each other

147
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,700

148
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,070
HN H&M maximize every

149
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,110
every sales he will do so online this

150
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,670
is possible and a dis is dangerous for
us

151
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,770
because we'll dis

152
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,960
yes said oh that and you will just buy
sounds of the

153
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,550
week don't really need so

154
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,589
this is also a program when you

155
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,700
stop thinking about providing for
example if you say okay

156
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,950
down I i just like some kittens and
phase which

157
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,980
I don't see the problem about that bed
you don't know why

158
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,320
maybe someone somewhere will see that's
that's the goalie

159
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,339
people loving kids owns are more
propelled

160
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,950
there is no profanity to have a car
accident if you loved it

161
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,170
okay know seeing no stinkin

162
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,890
say that in real life bed maybe that's a
goalie you will see that

163
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,410
okay so what is the pentagon sees a that

164
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,550
the insurance we directly say

165
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,030
0 you're probably have a picture

166
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,329
you will have probably a Jackson so you
will bear you have their own small

167
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:10,550
just because of that profiling is ready
very dangerous to

168
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,569
because it and buy directly with money
and buy directly

169
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,620
well said outside of The Web in the real
world

170
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,240
and after that could be bad for you job
to

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,680
and fathers day I think that we so what
happened in Syria

172
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,699
what is happening in a lot of countries
that in the world around there

173
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,260
we don't front wheel formation to be as
easy as Texas

174
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,100
like it is right now it's too easy for
people to access to information

175
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,560
and especially you can say okay I mean
you're up maybe in Germany

176
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,229
oh and France so there have been on
there on that

177
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,420
bad they out here far s

178
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,219
had the beginning the Adon that the bed

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,339
nobody can say what what will be legal

180
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,220
illegal in 10 years if today and I think
it ends its a good idea maybe in ten

181
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,920
years it will be completely forbidden

182
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,870
and then you can go in jail because
you're that file from 10 years ago was

183
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,040
already accessible so I am

184
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,170
week we have to do something about that

185
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,130
the the first thing we have to do is to
ensure that this service is

186
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,529
and the stuff to ask we are using so

187
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,580
the question to ask both said about that
is festival

188
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,440
wet what Schwank what do you want

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,240
at when do I want to I'd

190
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,940
if I try to I don't know if i mentioned
I want to buy something very

191
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,440
controversial on the Internet

192
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,800
I will need something ready ready secure

193
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,180
it's not the same at his as if I'd

194
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,430
just don't want to go to know that i'm
looking for shoes so

195
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,829
I who is providing the service if it's
someone

196
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,860
who is doing that too have more money I

197
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,770
is someone nonprofit like mother like in
the and especially a much

198
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,970
time and and money and how much
knowledge as they have

199
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,660
homogenate invest myself in this project
if

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,110
I know nothing I don't want to spend any
money because they don't care about my

201
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,870
data

202
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,770
and I don't have time to well I will use
the first

203
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,189
he met provider I will find that gmail
messed up like that

204
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,650
and that so and the last buying

205
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,319
is where is it located what what the
their low

206
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,700
in the country where my dad out it in
the USA

207
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,370
it in europe where is it so

208
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,980
when you bid that this creation

209
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,190
you see that you can go from

210
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,430
that too but I am with that up will be
something which

211
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,430
with the brady spend you will have to
spend a lot of time on it a lot of money

212
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,660
and you will need no laces to to be able
to do that

213
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,130
and at the bottom is just the gate on
terror i jus when companies I'm that so

214
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,370
and the first thing which is important
now is

215
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,720
to use free software because if you will

216
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,500
if you need to encrypt completely you
that I like you say okay I will you

217
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,030
start to protect myself

218
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,780
but if you do that on though on their
way on windows for example

219
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,300
you're just wrong because the

220
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,630
that the

221
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,040
the information you on train on your
keyboard are already recovered before

222
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,199
going to toss I just use it okay said

223
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,700
know I will talk about like him lady
miss then UN

224
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,960
its the new version of coalition so it's
a project from one year ago

225
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,190
12 years I and elos to

226
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,600
2 minutes 0 online with tracking

227
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,640
so I will share a short video to you
because I don't have wifi

228
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,189
really decided that this afternoon
saying that this morning without

229
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,400
so I am here is that being said as you
can see we just discovered that went to

230
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,110
that girl

231
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,550
was already phone on the first page on
went to

232
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,510
this is in Mt profile in Fairfax at and
they're right you can see

233
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,730
their organization and the sever so it
sing uni

234
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,900
ditching them and no I'm going to dis

235
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,209
Tom go to different website to see what
happened so

236
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,349
year ago and actually from Jeff a nation
okay there is a new one

237
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,360
so here will be a graph and it's not at
this graph with the

238
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,730
their website I visited directly

239
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,260
I'll and directly so at the moment it's
only directly

240
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,819
I went to beat a dead girl I went to the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

241
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,700
know I will go to the New York time
website

242
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,810
and their you will see that its

243
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,920
very different I'm so their website is
lowered

244
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,650
and here you go you have the New York
Times website so

245
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,610
when if ship that when the shape to
sickle I directly that it

246
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,060
um and how the website up L

247
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,069
our own then you have Tom I aware that

248
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,300
I went to the new york their website but
I'd didn't want to

249
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,939
say that to them so let's take the
example

250
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,910
on my side as before going to give a on
i'm looking for. camera

251
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,189
so they have a website

252
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,290
I'm also

253
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,800
poitier sides inside it so

254
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,920
just looking at as you can see

255
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,750
the f3 I'll you probably can't see it
where bed

256
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,080
the S and interesting point is that some

257
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,070
above the third party website are
connected to the two website

258
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,010
I visited so I am and the Middle East do
build

259
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,780
definitely that net its famous M
advertisement company

260
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,470
and a I'd like to say a kid this person
went

261
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,570
from New York that website to

262
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,339
e-bay why did they do that this can
about the mission is stressing

263
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm here is another website is priced
Minister

264
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,050
size again see there's tons of a content
include from

265
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,130
other sites and so now

266
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,350
I'll yeah I'm looking to get a

267
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,030
yeah the point is like and double click
for example is about to say

268
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,730
all all my navigation on the web are
directly im

269
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,290
tracked made his website

270
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,730
so involved in that year when that I
have time to re

271
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,190
explain that okay

272
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,970
you can see that there is tons a about
third party website

273
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,550
so agency that let me know

274
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,069
a year to filter I'll

275
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:06,640
yet

276
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,570
name OS two filter and different and two

277
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,060
to display on the their website they are
revisited a only a third party website

278
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,419
it lol analyst so show on earth
connection between this website

279
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,650
and here event had ice to block website
and to watch some website

280
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,650
especially to to be the focus on them so
that you can see it is in the USA

281
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,830
another viewing

282
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,159
interesting do with the least I'll the
website you visited

283
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,320
eugen from this Lease blotch Adam n

284
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,270
eugen or so the is a cloak view the
issue is

285
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,200
lower so this with an empty provides a
sunny today bit

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,530
when you chip browsing during for
example one which

287
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,129
it's really time consuming Safwat a a
big big graph

288
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,440
if you want to only see what's
interesting inside

289
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,920
you need to use the QlikView and the
last thing I want to show you is that

290
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,510
printed

291
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,720
contributes a that a this alone was
allowed to

292
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,220
try to make a graph of advertiser spying
on you so

293
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,040
if you want to contribute that could be
nice K

294
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,310
so I don't really have time to explain
you

295
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,919
how is that working technically but we
can talk about that outside

296
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,830
I'm this thing you have to know is like
it's not only about cream cheese and

297
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,970
everything like that

298
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,070
today the venue station

299
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,250
if I can say like that is just to try to

300
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,530
on you need to see if your bros hunh

301
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,420
for example the returning from Jeff a
nation from

302
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,730
trading you and your project which

303
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,160
will look a need to you to your brother

304
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,660
I'll to see if is unique looking at the
user-agent

305
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,010
looking at the plaguing imitable looking
at that time when you-

306
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,370
the phones almost everything and just by
looking at that

307
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,729
they are about to almost identify you

308
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,170
the main you need yet you will be

309
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,680
pretty almost it's time you

310
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,680
you they will be able to say okay it's
you f'n if any

311
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,770
they do not use crew Jesus stuff like
that

312
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,160
so I

313
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,120
either use I what can I do so in
firefights broke that body coaches

314
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,199
and in attract and you have some a
trusted solution I don't like go sorry

315
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,840
which is not freeze up to infertility
discredit me almost the same and it

316
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,409
frees up to is not as good as

317
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,420
go sorry at the moment but if you
contribute e with became

318
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,260
become better I am no script on request
policy for example to block

319
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,580
everything from hours I website but you
have to be more technical to do that

320
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,370
and you have to to yet nursing we did go
to be a

321
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,590
anyway so because for so if I show you

322
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:09,199
difference now I

323
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,030
I I will yet so here is the Preferences
to

324
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,070
to set it's a Fairfax I am so

325
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,010
the Do Not Track is just the flag to say
I don't want to be tracked

326
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,660
their website at nothing ablaze the
website

327
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,800
to this into your bed

328
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,070
at least you say it legally it's
important

329
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,510
clear the history

330
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,540
and as you can see

331
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,040
I know I have grocery and

332
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,610
and the extension so let's see the
difference

333
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,860
in a damn all that by

334
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,449
had there was a their web page A visited
just before

335
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,430
without anything actuated say just
refreshed it yes I'm

336
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:06,120
he made it go and you will see

337
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,469
at the right

338
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,800
there is a purple better which is

339
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,820
a.m. all the external count on that
history blocked

340
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,620
to protect you basically can go sorry
Jen find inside it

341
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,800
the exact element which was blocked

342
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,550
and you have some links to have more
information about

343
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,320
why from where answer

344
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,090
and though if we go to the graph area

345
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,199
so I think there is it is way better

346
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,580
I think again to say that this graph is
really really really nice

347
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,960
there than the previous one and
especially there is no

348
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,430
come on the between the sea de I did it
so

349
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:57,530
known that education history okay

350
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,050
and just to finish

351
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,909
what you can do as a boy with you user
because I know and the for them

352
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,070
usually I do not do but that here bed

353
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,120
you your ever to to change its services
so there is a foolish than prison wrecks

354
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,800
that hoe

355
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,820
up services again replace

356
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,899
you can for example host your own
services instead of using

357
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,960
on Google for your ad and I a to do list
of stuff like that

358
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,559
include and cozy clout on your project
about that and they are a great

359
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,789
you should try them and you should try
to use

360
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,629
ices which on that which %uh free stuff
so I

361
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:44,428
I think you already know that and spread
the word and especially the last night

362
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,190
but you can do as a web developer

363
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,299
try to avoid inclusion external content

364
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,710
if you can it's not that out

365
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,899
if you want on bad a social with on like
that like bed and help from Facebook for

366
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:57,439
example

367
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,679
you chant pet an image with just the
booze and

368
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,860
image you will us be made yourself not

369
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,809
on face with that and if someone click
on the image you a jet

370
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,590
but a little bit up to escape to replace
it with their real iframe provided by

371
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,689
by Facebook bat at least if someone
doesn't click on the Bhutan

372
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,299
it will not be tracked by Facebook Fan
that cancer yes think about it when you

373
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,129
include

374
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,529
the same for YouTube videos its is it to

376
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:33,509
on when the user click on it to replace

398
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,840
I don't know I just made the permission
to blame but I didn't write the code

399
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,990
inside in idaho for for it to be
compatible

400

405
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,380
