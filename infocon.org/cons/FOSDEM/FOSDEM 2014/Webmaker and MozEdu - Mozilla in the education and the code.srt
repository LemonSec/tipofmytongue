the its chemical and

159
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,639
I can then

160
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,889
a good kako bi in

161
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,069
not sure if area in a 55

162
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,149
phone death but the at them

163
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,290
good you would say the the cold

164
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,410
for the 11th you can't change this

165
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,709
and punish it a guy I know you could
tell me okay I can do this

166
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,569
using the the web dev tools a Firefox

167
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,498
of course the we can do this but I'm not
sure

168
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:46,269
everyone using him with a tougher for
third know their tools then

169
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,730
with you this without the being afraid
again so that's a simple tool

170
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,059
okay them and sorry

171
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,649
okay so you can see a a the

172
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,680
local here okay

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,500
so rich remix is the key word

174
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,829
a for others /url you have to keep in
mind that the

175
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,609
when a coat also I meant for the further
punish

176
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,040
odones for people will not devil both
well-known

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,059
takes that men fall them

178
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,730
earnest school kids follow the two
players

179
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,360
for for students of all

180
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,959

all just the make some cool things the
on the internet with the

182
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:42,910
without the having bona fides on both
along too much about the

183
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,139
going urged him to and the of course
when maker are provided the

184
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,270
on %uh

185
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,850

188
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,310
Wed major festivals so you you don't but
you won't have to bother about the

189
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,859
finding thing service and you can just

190
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,060
them URL

191
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,119
and then then friend 7 shown

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,170
any social networks the

193
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,199
me is the point is the

194
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,370
you win you will hear people user

195
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,900
%uh like to make something that looks
like butts

196
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,390
continue to web page eleven you so

197
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,720
you just have to those I'm okay with
this project in when maco

198
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,770
okay you like it you want to do
something like that okay just really fit

199
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,180
challenger whatever you want and it will

200
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,510
like okay so that's

201
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,319
whether I already said learning by
making and

202
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,350
you can stop by remixing an existing
project

203
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,050
of up from scratch whatever you want and
the

204
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,329
for think you fit all those fish

205
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,960
when they go then indication cool when a
guy is no good thing

206
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,090
12 languages and missing in simple terms
that it solo guys in the

207
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,470
as many languages as we can because five
in both camps

208
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,140
they don't for speaking English not
every kid or along the wall speaks

209
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,760
English

210
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,300
then in this whole thing that own
language in and

211
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,219
the teaching kids also because the

212
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,889
