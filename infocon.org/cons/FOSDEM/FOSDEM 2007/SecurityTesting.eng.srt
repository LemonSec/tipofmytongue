1
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,660
I'm glad well I'm glad so many of you

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,000
came out of church to be here this

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,169
morning I know it's difficult this

4
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,430
morning I want to talk about something

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,880
fairly serious security testing because

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,780
it's pretty much generally worldwide

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,370
done completely piss poor so put on your

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,820
your silver faces wake up a little bit I

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,309
may even point at some of you and ask

10
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:49,930
you questions and if you're not awake or

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,750
you don't respond i'll ask you to leave

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,300
it's that important my name's fevers up

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,300
on the managing director of mesa calm

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,890
which is an open source research

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,850
security collaborative community

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,860
basically i managed all the projects i

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,350
began by being the creator the austin

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,630
and i'm still the main developer of the

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,470
austin yes the OSS tea mmmm open source

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,070
security testing methodology manual

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,990
which the British started calling the

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,210
hasta and it works for me so yeah I

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,100
probably used to come as the managing

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,020
director mostly the volunteers the

25
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,229
Groves not the operations we have been

26
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,909
awesome in after high school we have

27
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:40,330
business

28
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,240
type rating testing we even arguing open

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,150
trusted computing as part of the trusted

30
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,170
computing consortium here in Europe with

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,000
HP IBM souza big group trying to bring

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,700
transparency to trusted computing which

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,530
is actually very very closed right now

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,650
and even we have proofs the infinium who

35
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,380
make the trusted platform module as part

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,230
of it goals and ambitions well you want

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,010
I'll be talk throughout this talk about

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,910
my lofty goals and ideals which is

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,970
basically to make security better to

40
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,250
make it better how we test security and

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,500
that's really important to understand

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,830
because we are all dependent on somebody

43
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,980
else doing their job right no matter

44
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,350
what we do whether we drive a car we

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,670
have to make sure the guy who did the

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,209
tire from the car wasn't asleep that day

47
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,920
we are so dependent when everybody else

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,330
does that my job as I see it my mission

49
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,150
my goal is to make sure that security is

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,670
done right and then it's not my fault

51
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,370
for not telling people how to do it

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,580
right I love the Eureka moment I love it

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,560
what an idea works when things come

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,860
together and i he'p malicious ignorance

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,980
I really hate when people say well I

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,810
didn't do it because I didn't come and

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,269
if it's your job that it's your job to

58
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,510
know unfortunately there's nothing like

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,690
malpractice in the security field so as

60
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,489
far as I seen security any type of

61
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,640
ignorance of Europe

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,290
is malicious so quick overview of today

63
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,100
security testing is complicated

64
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,850
verification is always something you

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,250
should do yourself if you rely on tools

66
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,800
you'll probably a fool hey lives and

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,590
there is a trip quickly sizing up

68
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,950
security and I'll teach that to you if

69
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,430
you're nice to me make it cool the

70
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,620
problem is that testing security is an

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,370
eight and so is protecting so whenever

72
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,880
we build

73
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:28,010
oh sure love the speaker okay basically

74
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,360
anything that we want to secure is

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,990
innate as developers we build things but

76
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,670
when we build things we build them so

77
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,260
that they work the way we want them to

78
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,000
we have an idea of how they're going to

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,270
work and generally any failure in how

80
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,960
they lurk is a problem it's an issue and

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,340
even though we like to think of security

82
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,330
as threats people attacking it's also a

83
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,180
simple as building a wall so that the

84
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,540
wall doesn't

85
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,340
okay we try to see it so when we build a

86
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:58,030
wall so when we build this fall we take

87
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,590
a lot of pride in the wall that we built

88
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,500
we're happy with that wall and the last

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,030
thing we want to do is test it by

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,340
pushing it over because what if we're

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,860
wrong in the wall balls or we have to

92
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,530
build the whole damn thing up again so

93
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,480
Security's a date while we feel that

94
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,520
while we're thinking that wolf has to

95
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,630
stay up yet we are also afraid to test

96
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,950
it because we don't want the

97
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,870
consequences of what happens when it all

98
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,950
down for work so that's earth builders

99
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,990
we have a problem with testing our own

100
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,100
stuff but then again in many instances

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,160
they ask the developers to test their

102
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,110
own things which is hard cause other

103
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,060
issues are interviews are biased

104
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,260
people's knowledge of security is very

105
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:56,800
subjective and post the tools are the

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,890
procedures best practices are built for

107
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,610
dessert the rules of the game the

108
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,880
problem is the real world of things

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
important roles

110
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,890
the hand analysis because then you find

111
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,980
that the tool will do is discard

112
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,530
positive receives because it wasn't

113
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:23,770
expecting it the truth is securing a

114
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,650
humbling experience if your insecurities

115
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,440
you will be constantly consistently

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,900
humbled cannot be arrogant insecurity it

117
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,420
just doesn't work okay you build a

118
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,550
better mousetrap don't mix better

119
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,010
balance details on the foolproof next

120
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,360
better pool that's just how it works now

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
a lot of people like to say the main

122
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,560
issue of security risk risk is not

123
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,190
security Security's protection risk is a

124
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,830
statistics game you can play the end if

125
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,359
you want or not but it's very subjective

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:13,590
this one here somehow I don't have and

127
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:22,350
it uses me there's a new mood thing in

128
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,650
medicine called evidence-based medicine

129
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,590
and the whole point is actually being

130
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,200
came out the 90s it's growing popularity

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,360
and it's about having the doctors

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,950
actually use science to diagnose people

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,030
yeah this is no you'll actually see it

134
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,080
starting to come up more and more

135
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,580
magazines it's a big deal and the reason

136
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,440
why is because obviously we know that

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,900
certain medicines effect you have side

138
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,400
effects they they may even cause kidney

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,010
liver damage in addition to healing it

140
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,260
so now with this evidence base they're

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,860
looking at maximizing your lifespan and

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,100
quality of life so for instance they may

143
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,200
not give you a drug because you're your

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,550
problem your cancer your disease may not

145
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,230
have an immediate effect for example if

146
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,670
you're seven years old is your chance

147
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,080
you'll probably die before some

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
electronic at strategy kills which has a

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
long term Peppa so they start looking at

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
these things and your quality of life

151
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,080
and so I like to think this is evidence

152
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,240
base security where you're actually

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,910
looking at the big picture no problem is

154
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,880
it doesn't work

155
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,080
emergencies doesn't like everyone and

156
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,930
the biggest flaw with actually using

157
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,610
science for security is the seaway see

158
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,280
fly a problem cover your ass people

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,980
don't like people would rather like a

160
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,470
big brand to say hey I do what I would

161
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,670
my books IBM i bought hpi book ernst &

162
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,910
young they came in they did their job

163
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,390
I'm pleading ok so the only people who

164
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,250
actually buy into the scientific method

165
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,740
who like into he's a cop who cover album

166
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,690
are the people actually need security

167
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,050
and not compliant so if you actually

168
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,380
need to secure something and not just

169
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,100
have a paper that says you're secure

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,350
you're going to be looking for this

171
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,360
methodology quick quiz you've seen in

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,700
the sky I assume here in Gotham you can

173
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,820
see this guy geese or ducks flying

174
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,360
overhead they find this deep pattern you

175
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,910
all see that cats wake up you've seen it

176
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,380
yes hell ok and one line of ducks is

177
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,900
always longer than the other you know

178
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,740
awfully security today the answer is

179
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,310
there's work bucks in it we think we

180
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,910
know what we're doing and we fail to

181
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,540
analyze because we are subjective we

182
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,120
need to test for we don't know why there

183
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
are more ducks in it okay but we do know

184
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,339
the illusion where dogs but we answer

185
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,250
the question why is it longer because

186
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,190
I'm more ducks and this is a problem

187
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,680
with analysis and security we're going

188
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,959
to talk about that oblivion time

189
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,980
basically as human beings we are

190
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,170
subjective our minds work in a certain

191
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,180
way when we apply wait to different

192
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,459
risks depending on how important it is

193
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,160
to us we're definitely not objective

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,360
about it so we needed to look at

195
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,250
something new in the way we perceive and

196
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,649
divide security and we did this in the

197
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,800
Austin which is under copyleft the

198
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,170
methodology is under the oml the open

199
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,970
methodology license something we had to

200
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,360
create because the methodology cannot be

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,149
copyrighted a methodology is considered

202
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,000
a trade secret so we designed a license

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,829
for open trade secret basically the

204
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,020
ideas and somebody else can't say it's

205
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,520
our print so what do we do do with y'all

206
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,950
so three well we want to categorize

207
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,440
security into calculable components

208
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,260
clear definition securitymetrics we

209
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,390
started adding things about pests errors

210
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,860
test types

211
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,160
classifications blah blah blah we wanted

212
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,930
it to be practical for the auditor as

213
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,630
well as a developer so the developer

214
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,700
would be able to quickly size up

215
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,529
security in when they're developing

216
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,470
while they are developing it without

217
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,589
needing to resort to some huge manual or

218
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,519
checklist which is often dated or wrong

219
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,589
and we wanted to get rid of best

220
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,390
practices so yalls the three is

221
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,450
completely do research it's actually big

222
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,490
research which is why it's taking so

223
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,380
long and for all news all those people

224
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,880
who say hey why does it take four years

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,010
for the awesome to come out approval I

226
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,560
would I ask you who else has security

227
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,760
metrics that actually work yeah they can

228
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,230
work out a much longer than us okay

229
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,230
let's look at the security testifying

230
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,420
what is a security test well mercy who I

231
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,630
goes we want to measure operation we

232
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,070
want to know how something actually

233
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,579
works if we don't know how it works we

234
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,019
can't tell you how it's not working

235
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,510
right so it's important to actually

236
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,920
understand how something works then

237
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,890
we're able to apply measures security

238
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,010
measures which are actually a good fit

239
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,199
from there once we actually know how it

240
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,709
works what security measures are there

241
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:11,490
then we can start our risk analysis but

242
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,730
we completely keep bias risk out of the

243
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,920
awesome there's only one place where it

244
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,810
even shows up a little bit and that's

245
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,820
where you sell

246
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,780
assess your home Harris and we do that

247
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,060
for two reasons one because it helps you

248
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,270
learn more and to it helps your client

249
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,290
or whether you're testing or auditing

250
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,120
understand the difficulty level of the

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,670
job you know stick it's not an insult to

252
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,620
you if you have a lot of errors because

253
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,110
it could be the network thing we're

254
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,060
testing produce a lot of errors it could

255
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,080
be uncooperative sysadmin and the beauty

256
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,660
of it is that you actually get a report

257
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,640
that you fill out at the end where you

258
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,040
explain these things so you not only say

259
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,140
what you test but most importantly but

260
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,350
who did not test so later another

261
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,210
company comes along it doesn't audit you

262
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,650
could actually compare the two for

263
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,940
thoroughness when we look at this

264
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,050
testing we found that a fundamental

265
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,780
level was done wrong a lot of places we

266
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,610
actually had a community push us to make

267
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,280
a certification and the reason why was

268
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,020
that way they could hire people that

269
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,820
they knew could hit the ground running

270
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,010
that they could work immediately and

271
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,440
they wouldn't know what to do so we

272
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,930
ended up making to certification for

273
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,900
that contesting and analysis yo misty

274
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,810
and UOP assay and just to give you a

275
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,380
little bit of a idea of how they work

276
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,390
for something like a 0 PST you'll have

277
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,250
to define things like where's your

278
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,350
physical location of a web server over

279
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,230
the Internet if you have three different

280
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,060
services on the server returning three

281
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,880
different TTLs during your port scan

282
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,500
what's actually happening what kind of

283
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,540
increased data you need to collect in

284
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,560
order to come up with a better analysis

285
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,480
and even though things like you do

286
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,709
skin and port 80 comes back that it's

287
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:13,190
open but then when you tell them to it

288
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,420
you don't get a response anybody want to

289
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,529
explain why that 13 go ahead transparent

290
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:27,529
grunts brilliant good idea that's one

291
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,529
way to do it how would you check what

292
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:40,490
other testament you need to do okay when

293
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,750
we did when would you consider yourself

294
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,970
done when how many more would you pass

295
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,160
before you decided that you've tested it

296
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,399
up what is the magic number no it could

297
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,779
be as simple as looking at the TTL

298
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,760
you're going to have a shorter TTLs

299
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,889
because it's closer to you that's one

300
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,470
definitive test and yes you could make

301
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,180
more tests and see than that's happening

302
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,040
that it is a coincidence but that's how

303
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,020
you do it and this is what we show how

304
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,849
would you come up with the new tests on

305
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,740
the fly because you always have new

306
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,390
technologies you're always going to have

307
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,520
new issues while you're testing and we

308
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,260
want people who can actually think for

309
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,549
themselves and not just run a tool to be

310
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,380
able to come up with the new test as it

311
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,329
comes up so we had VPNs that we had

312
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,750
vpns and i know very large company who

313
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,610
is looking for somebody who could test

314
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,299
security test ssl VPN or procurement the

315
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,429
problem was is that the extra sailors

316
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,649
got Annapolis nobody's ever really

317
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:44,640
tested ssl vpns before and so they were

318
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,350
doing their typical web tenses the

319
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,690
problem was is that these security

320
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,510
experts weren't and finding new tests

321
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,039
they were stuck with a new technology so

322
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,700
this is what we try to bring into people

323
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,159
one last thing that I tell that is not

324
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,010
the protocol for web so that can also be

325
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,380
your problem in analysis we do the same

326
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,820
thing we want people to be able to hit

327
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,710
the ground running who wants one

328
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,210
important thing the people you do

329
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,799
business with to actually understand

330
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,659
what back to talking about so we try to

331
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,789
teach analysis which is actually the OPA

332
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,799
is a harder class than the ODST so we

333
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,840
always recommend the second but we look

334
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,789
into things like the famous trades

335
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,289
around we both have a traceroute they

336
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,029
assume all you public developers when

337
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,320
you doing trace around sometimes you get

338
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,580
back with little stars sir why those

339
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,490
cars come back guess you

340
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,410
firewall filtered icing events that's

341
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:06,590
what you put on report sir

342
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,100
the first part the router not returning

343
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,570
you get a gold star the only thing he

344
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,640
goes that you did not receive a response

345
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,290
you don't know why see you have this

346
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,120
innate thing where we think we can

347
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,940
assume based on our experiences which is

348
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,010
why we always contain no my robot

349
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:52,370
something and we can go up let's get

350
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,080
some background information let me

351
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,870
define frequency dirty it's something

352
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,670
which protects an asset from the French

353
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,630
okay basically you are actually

354
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,610
separating the threat from the asset so

355
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,190
if recompilation doing that is you move

356
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,590
away from the threat okay you're pretty

357
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,990
lightning there's right as lightning so

358
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,780
you move inside them to write your

359
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,790
thread is terrorist so you close all

360
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,620
borders okay you eliminate the threat

361
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,570
some countries go after the threat they

362
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,030
decide to destroy the whole threat and

363
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,480
that answers the problem I'm not going

364
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,940
to say I'm sure you guys

365
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,020
except for you convert the threat which

366
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,580
is something that was very popular back

367
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,350
in the early days of Spain the Spanish

368
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,650
Inquisition as we can see that any way

369
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,360
that we apply security it's usually

370
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,850
fairly aggressive safety on the other

371
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,920
hand is where you learn to live with the

372
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,530
threat basically what a control access

373
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,720
process interactivity or the impact of

374
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,370
the threat so that's where you get

375
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,520
things like your authentication you have

376
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,280
people travel with like these all sorts

377
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,660
of things that you want to do to lessen

378
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,700
the threat so of course if your peers

379
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,740
lightning maybe you walk around in a

380
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,060
Faraday cage okay or you cut down the

381
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,470
trees around your house so that they

382
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,910
cannot go to the trees and it falls

383
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,940
through your roof goes your family range

384
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,990
of Gd okay so now that we understand the

385
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,320
difference between security and safety

386
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,430
which apparently the dictionaries going

387
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,780
and we can actually take our concerns

388
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,840
with how security works okay so what

389
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
this means is that we don't have to care

390
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,310
what they have for security solutions we

391
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,040
care how it works okay everyone here

392
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,270
might be familiar with the pci data

393
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,070
requirements or Visa MasterCard some of

394
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,520
you might know that basically you have

395
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,490
these checklists and actually including

396
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,840
where the government will know these

397
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,810
checklists or vs vs m79 not even though

398
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,700
the checklist and they ask you things

399
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,870
like are they running game virus what

400
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,570
the actual question is does antivirus

401
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,440
even work another that's saying that the

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,120
update every day I'm talking about

403
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,210
they've got a whole slew of blackness

404
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,490
technologies that they're running

405
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,010
blackness technologies and they're

406
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:37,770
calling that security by the way which I

407
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,360
just said that now that this was on the

408
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,700
web you know

409
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,030
special funding from symantec i still

410
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,080
sit down with them take among them so

411
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,110
basically we divided we met a life

412
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,600
operational security or upset in the

413
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,880
base into visibility access and trust

414
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,530
visibility is your number of targets in

415
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,960
the scope based on an index index is how

416
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,050
you help them okay by a pianist I'm

417
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,450
addressed by person my street address

418
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,270
there's ways that you count and from a

419
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,090
vector from the inside and the outside

420
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,250
from within one new vantage point versus

421
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,820
another basically your visibility is

422
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,770
opportunity if you know something is

423
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,930
there you can attack access is unique

424
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,890
interaction points okay so basically any

425
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,840
place where you can have an

426
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,870
interactivity could be a service could

427
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,770
be a colonel response like ICP or

428
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,960
there's otherwise doing like physical

429
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,540
security audit you have doors and

430
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,300
windows which actually open those are

431
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,640
the interactivity points as opposed to

432
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,380
the ones that are sealed shut which are

433
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,270
not when they get on trust where the

434
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,040
targets actually interact with each

435
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,580
other nickel open man like a web server

436
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,760
and database server or an internal

437
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,450
helpdesk that will not identify the

438
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,070
people who call it comes from internal

439
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,850
number then you have your safety your

440
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,490
controls the states of it

441
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,820
you have your class a in your class b we

442
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,100
got really clever with our label so just

443
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,620
go with the problem is is that any time

444
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,110
to label anything you make the people

445
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,210
who don't know a damn thing looking very

446
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,270
angry about vocabulary because people

447
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,570
actually like to argue yep to the nation

448
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,790
we like art so of course if you label

449
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,460
something they argue the semantics or

450
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,980
the definition of white label and this

451
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,990
is where I take this as a fan sa the

452
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,930
taste way just go with the definition

453
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,700
out for when you call them so here we

454
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,340
have your African process we're going to

455
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,110
go through them your interactive

456
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,910
controls our authentication blackness

457
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,970
whitelist tokens passwords

458
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,140
indemnification which is to cover your

459
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,390
ass basically take out insurance and

460
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,850
everything so you have an asset an asset

461
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,960
you take insurance on X asset somebody

462
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,050
steals it you get big money you don't

463
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,580
care ok even better it data security you

464
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,250
have asset somebody makes illegal copy

465
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,160
of said asset you still have asset you

466
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,440
still sell it you get big money

467
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,530
resilience you want to be able to

468
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,710
control how something fails so that it

469
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,340
feels securely it fails closed ok so

470
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,650
you're going to roll make you shoot the

471
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,040
security guard and magically he falls

472
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,720
against the door you can't move him he's

473
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,640
so big for the door stays shut ok

474
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,760
fireball gets hit balls over make sure

475
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,320
everything is closed subjugation

476
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,700
basically the controls are held by the

477
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,890
people who make the controls so

478
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,690
basically you've all seen this you go to

479
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,330
place the guard you see the paper to

480
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,030
sign yourself in he looks at your ID

481
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,520
gives it back to you you finish signing

482
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,030
yourself in handle the paper that failed

483
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,460
subjugation which means he should have

484
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,740
signed you in because now you can find

485
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,660
anything you wanted do you think he's

486
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,160
going to remember every party looks at

487
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,090
you see that everywhere for my way you

488
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,280
also see client-side input filters in

489
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,730
browsers it was huge with JavaScript for

490
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,100
a long time probably still it and then

491
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,480
of course when you mentioned people go

492
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,580
up server-side JavaScript which

493
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,210
continuity basically there's no

494
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,640
interruption in the interaction you go

495
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,679
to the grocery store you want to go

496
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,220
check out the calendar total bull but

497
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,920
they keep putting on new patch years so

498
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,450
basically they can handle any volume

499
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,610
they keep putting in more cash years as

500
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,830
you need to okay gorgeous block they

501
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,929
have a secondary gori still cutting it

502
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,050
out business service doesn't stop so we

503
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,640
also know this has survivability and

504
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,790
load balancing redundancy okay we want

505
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,760
to avoid the single point of failure for

506
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,570
such a big deal as you can notice

507
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,380
attention at odds with resilience

508
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,580
because here you when the service is to

509
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,070
keep going and on the other

510
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,110
to fail securely non-repudiation you

511
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,399
want to make sure that you know all the

512
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,649
actors roles within an interaction but

513
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:58,389
they can't deny it some people comes

514
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,259
confidentiality this is the big one

515
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,700
basically you're looking at anything

516
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,289
that's displayed or exchanged between

517
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,330
parties and seeing only between them and

518
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,279
not outsiders yeah we think we know that

519
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:15,139
way yet we still call them privacy when

520
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:17,899
privacy is actually the asset is

521
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:19,759
displaying or change between parties in

522
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,809
a way that's only known to them okay so

523
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,759
that means you have this you see this up

524
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,909
pretty much every TV movie that guild

525
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:31,519
with bad guys drug dealers and stuff is

526
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,820
that they know the drug deal is going

527
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,789
down but they have to catch them doing

528
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:40,340
it in the act and they don't know where

529
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,909
the deal is going down so of course all

530
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,519
of a sudden they just know that famous

531
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,320
Miami drug dealer shows up and tell okay

532
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,679
famous other Belgian drug dealer shows

533
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,440
up and tell all the sudden they both

534
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,659
walk away one person buys a Lamborghini

535
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:04,029
and the other one you know hi skype so

536
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,740
the problem with Heights they actually

537
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,899
didn't see the interaction happening so

538
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:10,870
they couldn't prove that in heaven hence

539
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,830
business you do behind closed doors

540
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,899
integrity is your control already

541
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:22,159
undisclosed changes a guilty pleasure I

542
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,500
have to see this working really well is

543
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,210
with any

544
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,010
passing by passion sore finger ppi which

545
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,610
by the ways realistic and then of course

546
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,370
alarm so any kind of notification that

547
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,830
safety is fail circumvented so you have

548
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,550
to wonder things like I'm yes alerts is

549
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,510
it an alarm or is it not server logs if

550
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,630
nobody reads them if they get ignored is

551
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,200
it really an alarm okay and then of

552
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,340
course you have something differently

553
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,170
home security systems where something

554
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,940
that there's a door there's a little

555
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,820
Cassidy red thing and so there you can

556
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,220
actually block each access point with an

557
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,620
alarm so that way when its open in any

558
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,840
way whether it's the lockets broken door

559
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,490
is broken now and they come in through a

560
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,410
window gilbertsville sounds then there's

561
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,290
a third part of this called limitations

562
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,830
and here you have there were vulnerable

563
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,930
ities weaknesses concerns exposures and

564
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,990
uglies yes we classify five ways you'll

565
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,730
see the cpes basically we use

566
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,270
vulnerabilities exposure we have mapped

567
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,360
pretty much one to one with the common

568
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,470
accepted way of classifying things but

569
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,260
we do it a little different because the

570
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,900
the normal way plus I'm vulnerabilities

571
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,090
actually doesn't work you've noticed

572
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,970
over the years people keep rehashing old

573
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,280
ideas there's not been any new research

574
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,790
our new research that's come out and

575
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,710
show that there are better ways to

576
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,530
classify vulnerabilities yet in order

577
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,150
according to the accepted it still has

578
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,010
to be sort of like

579
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,280
views and whether or not but if all the

580
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,580
vulnerability weakness or ABCDE we don't

581
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,530
care they'll come back to the

582
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,420
definitions SL a vulnerability needs

583
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:22,450
that's what it means to me so basically

584
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,820
you give denying access for you hide

585
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,860
your assets that's a vulnerability a

586
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,920
week very simple you know you can pretty

587
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,510
much anybody can use this figure it out

588
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,390
the risk that's involved in that

589
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,330
happening completely at issue not our

590
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,630
problem we're just doing the metric for

591
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,850
security the weakness actually depends

592
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,130
on the class a controls that plus B

593
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,070
controls for concerns exposures feels

594
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,380
and visibility and another lease or

595
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,210
anything that's unidentified unknown

596
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,220
that can't get comfortable now the

597
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,530
beauty behind this is that we know given

598
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,840
multipliers you don't say this one is

599
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,080
worth five times as much as this one or

600
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,820
this one

601
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,470
what X versus this next that's obscene

602
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,360
bias old-school thinking of getting more

603
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,490
into the morning the day of people bacon

604
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,250
I mean that love enemies and that's

605
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,380
still what they're selling instead what

606
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,570
we said was based on the controls and

607
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,980
the operational security that you

608
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,279
actually have in place right now that's

609
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,139
what terms the values that go here so

610
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:40,230
this is actually dynamic how much what

611
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,399
multi-billions work depends on how many

612
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,120
controls how they work the controls

613
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,500
because actually even able to hold a

614
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,480
million going to control itself or the

615
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,440
security that you have in place so yeah

616
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,240
believe it or not the value above a

617
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,700
limitation actually depends on the

618
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,490
security controls you have one amazing

619
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:10,080
concept that's right on the genius I

620
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,700
can't believe somebody else in club i

621
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,289
think somebody did they work for

622
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:19,509
corporation they got meyer so we what it

623
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:22,690
quantify it basically we have this

624
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,850
beautiful sheet and easy comedy download

625
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,309
and use it yourself so then you don't

626
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,580
have to do math okay you just have to

627
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,320
count and most of us can do that

628
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,639
counting okay real integers span see

629
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:41,679
basically your visibility or access and

630
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,559
trust and then your controls and we will

631
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,259
help ease up ease up

632
00:33:50,040 --> 00:34:00,570
jittery okay le weakness you'll get this

633
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,190
the many other controls we have in place

634
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,990
open his for dessert bring an exposure

635
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,560
or boiling holcomb Billy you can happen

636
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,040
because it's dynamic it's rare and you

637
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
have tons of three screws securing you

638
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,190
to get it when it happens so basically

639
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,000
we look at visibility we found 250

640
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,909
servers systems and up the 412 access

641
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,790
points and 14 of them and trusts from

642
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,530
this vector that week each other and

643
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,440
then we also count up the rest of the

644
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,730
parts ok now that we other here is that

645
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,739
can you talk those 10 no I walk off set

646
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,310
so for every opening you have all 10

647
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,280
controls the bite is basically the same

648
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,050
timing that hold close so what they

649
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,030
tells you is that you have an open

650
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,470
service okay telnet which has no

651
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,830
controls except authentication so

652
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,870
basically the value of that holds point

653
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,270
nine out of so it's still pretty white

654
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:17,180
oak SSH offers contemporary ription

655
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,860
angiolini hungry and authentication so

656
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,400
you're already a footstep so it's a moon

657
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,840
each limitations values depended

658
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,050
abundant outside the control values are

659
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,220
controls it changes their which case

660
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,680
your title Delta how is a habit is

661
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,530
influenced your Delta tells you your

662
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,930
security team so for example if this was

663
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,900
a network what network out of two

664
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,810
networks to companies inviting and you

665
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,660
already had the other value you could

666
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,760
actually combine the two values or you

667
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,190
can say this change that would happen

668
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,660
when we had their network tower we can

669
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,520
already predict the security change

670
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,840
which I just talked kind of assistance

671
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,950
ok so this implying games we could ask

672
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,870
ourselves we can answer these questions

673
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,330
theoretically before we try it use

674
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,130
whatever firewall better than a host

675
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,740
Bible in each system or the two-factor

676
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,420
authentication really make a difference

677
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,210
in security so we can basically look at

678
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,650
this we say all right here we have minus

679
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,460
nine where we have 50

680
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,110
okay no controls each one has a

681
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,780
host-based firewall so we've got a Vegas

682
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,620
94 changing security a network firewall

683
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,810
add one additional business visibility

684
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,290
it's an additional system and a single

685
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,510
point failure so it has no weakness

686
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,620
we've got 19 15 what do you think people

687
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,530
are doing out there in corporate growth

688
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,090
we know thank you they do the single

689
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,380
fire mode because it's easier to

690
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,740
administrate which isn't actually true

691
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,060
if the administrator time should take

692
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,480
their jobs how many administrators here

693
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,880
how many huh me if you were lazy keep

694
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,830
your hands up all right just go for the

695
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:39,920
phone okay one factor of Education 97.9

696
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,420
where you have 45 systems each one I use

697
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,940
with one surface open one of those as

698
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,460
believe one of those services has an

699
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,300
authentication so we have 97.9 and you

700
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,580
add an additional authentication to that

701
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,840
service here 27.2 so makes a slight bit

702
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,730
of difference but two-factor

703
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,270
authentication also means a huge cost

704
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,710
because you're talking about token

705
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,260
sort of new tricks okay so you can

706
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,290
actually then see it may justifies the

707
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,170
cost I'm almost done here people now

708
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,970
your party tricks because you're all so

709
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,140
nice to me okay these are fun you go to

710
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,930
the track of s to the party and you

711
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,790
explain to them which room is more

712
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,990
secure the living room or the bedroom

713
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,910
and they should go with you come on you

714
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,530
can do it in your head you can copy the

715
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,980
offset visibility access trust just

716
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,890
count the windows the doors they open

717
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,619
great rate so we're going to try to you

718
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,109
explain to the host exactly how secure

719
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:56,010
the silverware yeah it is and then you

720
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:01,050
test it great star tricks for dear

721
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,200
friends then when the police come to the

722
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,560
house okay they explained with my

723
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,890
officers you can tell them exactly

724
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,510
precisely the security metrics that just

725
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,660
because the house is rockin that it's

726
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,089
still very safe and you'll just go away

727
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:28,390
because they get you psyched okay

728
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,580
to wrap it up to peace proper security

729
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,850
testing for TB hasta you can find any

730
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,700
method transparency television didn't do

731
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,610
as much as you did you you don't rely on

732
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,250
pattern matching meaning just because

733
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,400
your experience says that the router in

734
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,310
respond to that ICMP packet doesn't mean

735
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,430
that that's always the case your

736
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,800
intuition is a weakness and a scientific

737
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,080
methodology mean what you think works

738
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,530
you know what your gut feeling is is

739
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,590
probably statistically well and you

740
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,360
won't know that this Junction try it do

741
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,220
the test and you're consistently right

742
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,170
all the time which sub developer

743
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,830
sometimes are but they're like throwing

744
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,780
one gene with me robot Angus you want to

745
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,860
be very formal of your verification

746
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,530
process that means you actually tested

747
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,620
formally and not just cut corners you

748
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,370
want to recognize with

749
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,230
a hostile environment meaning that

750
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,370
you're going to have a lot of

751
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,030
interactivity that you do not cost yes

752
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,580
many testings on the internet other

753
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,830
people on the internet might be going to

754
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,100
those surfers at the same time that's

755
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,680
right it's dynamic so I must forget that

756
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,100
and common criteria it's a good place to

757
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,830
start when you're trying to figure out

758
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,220
things about systems but since people

759
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,260
get to make up their own criteria before

760
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,330
it goes into it it's not always correct

761
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,820
but it does maybe some good idea like

762
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,520
for example Microsoft we know is not

763
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,410
designed for hostile environments and

764
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,900
they know that they've meant that yet

765
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,650
legally legally they can sell by a

766
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,990
server that goes with they did package

767
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,350
internet utilities internet applications

768
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,690
for product that they knowingly know

769
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,630
could not be a hostile environment and I

770
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,610
say Microsoft they also includes a lot

771
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:34,160
of Linux it's too so keep that in mind

772
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,780
quick thing about a certification if

773
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,790
you're interested basically going to

774
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,740
walk the walk things even if you guys

775
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,480
know how to take it you might want to

776
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,240
consider hiring somebody who

777
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,670
security it's pretty much a standard for

778
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,110
if you want to hire somebody you want to

779
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,090
make sure that they actually know what

780
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,490
they say they know this is a good

781
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,950
fundamental guy if you're looking for a

782
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,220
good security person who can actually

783
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,090
think and develop tests on the job and

784
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:12,810
no robots so we have the analyst cable

785
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:18,750
tester ok any any questions and

786
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,990
information

787
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,848
with all the way

788
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:48,680
does the cdss fit into the Austin how

789
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,010
does it work sure anything can be

790
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,840
integrated in the austin in that way i

791
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,500
don't particularly think it works but

792
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,420
that's my opinion i haven't done a

793
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,130
thorough testing on it but i think it's

794
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,730
very biased and in a security task where

795
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,110
you try to say something about

796
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,540
operations in the factual manner to

797
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,060
integrate something bias into it where

798
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,070
you know specifically saying the report

799
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,620
or to the client that it's biased you

800
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:21,040
are lying yes

801
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,640
that's where you find limitations within

802
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,140
the authentication scheme sorry the

803
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,119
question was do video up there what

804
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,790
happens with the strength of a password

805
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:53,230
or the existence of a password in an

806
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,720
authentication scheme do we just count

807
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,490
or is there any kind of waiting to it

808
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:00,520
the point is is that there is no waiting

809
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,060
it's just you do test it and if you find

810
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,950
vulnerabilities or weaknesses or

811
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,869
concerns in the authentication scheme

812
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:13,020
itself then they also counts against it

813
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,930
does that make sense you're still

814
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,270
testing the controls controls you can

815
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,530
you can have for instance you have

816
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,260
antivirus but admires is just a

817
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,850
blacklist when your tests are going to

818
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,580
find that it has lots of weaknesses

819
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,100
depends on it depends on good passwords

820
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,560
and help out the tokenism that's why you

821
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,130
tested okay I think we're out of time

822
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,560
here almost anything else anybody else

823
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,790
well he says we're not so easy questions

824
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,810
now only easy questions favorite color

825
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:00,970
favorite animal unicorn just come on

826
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:10,990
nobody else can I explain why I don't

827
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,140
talk about risk risk is biased and it's

828
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,300
different for everybody so for example

829
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,250
maybe the thrill of jumping out of an

830
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,830
airplane is worth the plunge 10,000 feet

831
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,890
to your death because you really like it

832
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,770
okay it's a different thrill for me it's

833
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,869
very biased so we would have a different

834
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:31,270
risk weighting system toward something

835
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,910
like that the Austin is health is a

836
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,130
platform for risk so when you do the

837
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,410
metrics you actually have a foundation

838
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,100
that's that's solid then you add your

839
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,630
risk then you can say well this

840
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,670
vulnerability is used a lot or we see

841
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,770
this in the wild or any of the opinion

842
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,510
you want that goes in your summary

843
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,869
report but at least I'm the foundation

844
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:55,560
of knowing what's even their first

845
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:06,550
somebody else yes who as a matter of

846
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,800
fact I do know that certain governments

847
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,880
do we find it in Switzerland Germany

848
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,540
Mexico I do know that the United States

849
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,830
Treasury Department recognizes it I

850
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,490
guess you could say we trained a lot of

851
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,460
people a lot of departments not that

852
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,230
many I fear from they don't have to tell

853
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,300
me if they use it but i only hear

854
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,420
secondhand so i can only say on the side

855
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,000
who talked to me or who told me for

856
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,640
example my biggest one I was talking

857
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,700
about yesterday was that I heard from

858
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,670
NASA Ames Research and for me that's

859
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,060
that's like the big mecha you know

860
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,720
that's that's just our rocket scientists

861
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,800
so for all those people who hate me

862
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,900
that's that's okay because you know i

863
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,010
got NASA

864
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,320
but yeah they don't have to tell me and

865
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,180
where it's nice that they do but i don't

866
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,300
know but i think it is pretty much

867
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,650
covered i keep hearing the places that's

868
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,800
it okay i gotta catch a cab and catch a

869
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,990
flight back to Barcelona where it's warm
